You have to go here just once to see the amazing views.The hotel is a work of art! We paid to go on the Viewing Deck and it was fantastic.We went up in the daytime but I would love to go at night just to see Singapore lit up. You can just about see the people in the swimming pool from one viewing point as this is only accessible to hotel guests. The views totally blew me away - put this on your to do list.,4,
"We were a garden view facing the gardens by the bay, we also faced a motorway which I thought would be very noisy surprisingly it wasn't. The hotels service was amazing, the staff were friendly & helpful. We got shampoo,shower gel, conditioner, soap, toothbrush set and a comb. The pool had an amazing view of all of Singapore skyscrapers! The poll was an infinity pool and was 150m long. The pool was filled with people with selfie sticks and the keycard for the lifts didn't work well. :( overall a six star hotel, with great service.",5,
"A good friend and I were at MBS on the 30th of June for his belated birthday celebration, having not seen each other for a year. Arif & the reservations team made the whole MBS experience wonderful. Special care was taken to allocate requests & Arif was very friendly and handled the check-in process smoothly. The room was amazing, the infinity pool even more so and my friend had a great first impression of Singapore. Thank you MBS!",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is the latest icon on the Singapore skyline and likely to remain that way for the forseeable future. The architecture is dazzling and the entry lobby is stunning and impressive. Helpful and charming staff make the check-in process a pleasure. There are 3 towers and we were in Tower 3, 40th floor with amazing ocean views. The pool is on the roof in a stunning cantilevered constructions that reminds one of a canoe. looking at it from below. But the infinity pool with the illusion of a orizon at pools edge is startling. There is a wealth of shopping associated with the hotel and a number of restaurants, all of high quality. I would give this hotel 5 starts but for the fact that you can't walk out and be on a Downtown Street like the Swissotel. But there is the…",4,
"This is such an iconic hotel in Singapore and one must stay here at least once. The service is outstanding. For the hotel this size your made felt special everywhere you go, The check in process was quick and simple and the check in staff were very helpful with providing quick information and ideas on things to do. Our room was ready well ahead of time which we really appreciated. Our room was big and luxurious as one would expect. Also a great city view. There are lots of lifts so it never took long to get to the room. The pool was brilliant and a must if you stay here. Yes its cold and its crowded but I agree if it was any warmer there would be no room to move in the pool. Lots of loungers which is great so it was never hard to get one.  Overall a must stay if you visit…",5,
"The MBS is certainly one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  A key contributing factor is the fact that it is fairly new and everything is in good condition and the rooms are pretty awesome.    The only downside is that a lot of guests staying there have no respect for anyone else, the environment or perhaps anything at all.  They simply have so much money they believe that they are above humanity.  Like the foul people their foul kids have the same attitude.    The pool deck could have been absolutely amazing, however it was mostly under construction while I was there.  If you're considering staying here, then first check the status of the construction.  You don't want to be paying MBS prices and then finding you can't enjoy the facilities.  There was a jack hammer going off…",5,
"Me and my boyfriend only spent one night at MBS.   We went to check in at 11 a.m and was told the room was not ready, so we went out for lunch and came back later at 3 p.m to collect the key cards. The receptionists were alright, they didn't have much smile but nothing to complain about it. Our luggage were delivered to the room 5 minutes later after we got in, that was quick! And the porter man explained all the facilities in the room and how to connect to wifi. Very helpful! But our room was a deluxe room on 5th floor, no view, couldn't see the sea nor city view. So if you want to see a better view, better ask for a higher floor.  What made me surprise was that when we finished the schedule of our first day in Singapore and opened the door of our room, I saw two beautiful…",4,
"We are fortunate to be in Singapore  at a time when they are celebrating their golden jubilee.   As a result, fireworks and a airshow displays are being practiced each week till August.  An amazing area that has been reclaimed from the sea.  The area at night looks amazing with all the coloured lights used.  Well worth a visit.  Lots of eateries around also.",4,
"By far the wort service I have received from an alleged 5 star hotel.   We came here for a night for my wife's birthday - we had two club rooms with an interconnecting door. $720 per room, per night.   Based on the above price we were expecting reasonable service.   A week before we arrived I asked if I could arrange a birthday cake for my wife. Not a complimentary one but one that I would pay for. I was told ""send us an email"".  I sent 3 emails over 4 days and received no response. I called up again and was told ""send us an email"".  After explaining that I had already sent several the lady reluctantly said she would email options through. When the email finally arrived it contained the room service menu and the only cake on it was a slice of cake. Not exactly what I was…",1,
"My first trip to Singapore and Marina Bay Sands has left the best memory of the city!! Rooms-Very clean, has every basic need in the room. The view is just unforgettable. Be it Garden side or sea-side. Service-The best experienced ever!!humble, quick and very systematic Location-You can cover most of the places in Singapore by yourself rather by walk. Gardens by the bay, Singapore Flyer, Merlion, Lao Pa Sat,etc are all nearby Pools- Ultimate view from the 57th floor..Dont miss this if you are staying back. Restaurants=Yummy breakfast!!",5,
"We had a great week at MBS. Staying at the Orchid Suite we were provided with an excellent and clean room with excellent views of the ocean. The Club and staff were amazing and courteous. As it was my wife's birthday during our stay, the team ensured a memorable week of celebration. Would recommend Osteria Mozza for a wonderful dinner.",5,
"Stayed 1 night.If you like hustle and bustle and lots to see this is the hotel, the location is great and the rooms are a nice size and very clean but the pool area is too small so need to go early to get a sunbed. The breakfast choice was good. Check in and Check out very slow. This hotel is worth experiencing and we did enjoy our stay",3,
"This hotel located at very central location, subway station is underground. Gorgeous view toward Marina bay if your room number is odd, the other side is toward Garden by the bay and the sea is further.  Infinity pool is already very famous there, for privacy they only allow hotel guests to access. Good point.  Dont really like the interior anyway, just nothing impressive. Since it shares platform with Shopping mall, convention center and Casino..so it looks not so premium, kind of tradeoff for the convenience.",4,
"Marina bay sands is a very very large hotel.. As a result the usual level of service you would expect from a hotel in its price category is missing and you feel more like being herded... Check in can take some time, as can check out and the lobby is always crowded.  The room its self was very nice, large, spacious with a very comfy bed..   Beware however that there is currently construction going on on the pool level which takes up half of the pool deck (the vast majorly of the shaded areas) and as a result There is constant banging, drilling, circular saws, jackhammer",3,
"Loved the iconic rooftop infinity pool - definitely lived up to my expectations and more!   Everything else was good but not fantastic. Liked the abundant choices of restaurants that were handy.   Price wise it was on the expensive side and outside of the pool, there wasn't much to be said about the room (clean and small). Worth going once to experience the pool and that's it. ",4,
"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands is one of my bucket list trips. Just spent 3 fabulous nights in a suite. Well worth the money! The rooms are amazing, the staff are wonderful, attentive and sooo friendly. Recommend upgrading to a club room and making use of the club lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks. ",5,
"Stopped off in Singapore for 2 days on our way to London. Because of our early 8am arrival I'd booked one of our rooms from the day before so that we could check in immediately and rest after a 11hour flight. Pool is very crowded and full of people in the pool with phones, cameras and selfie sticks. A major pain for us there wanting to swim without getting a stick shoved in our face.   Had a minor medical issue that required a doctor to visit us in hotel. The staff handled this very efficiently and helped us the whole way. Phones calls were made later to asking if we needed anything.   Overall the staff is very polite and seem genuinely caring. The rooms and common areas are very clean. Dining in our rooms took 30mins to arrive and was hot and delicious.  Would love to visit…",5,
The hotel took 2 hours to allot us our 2nd room on arrival wasting our day completely . In spite  of check-in time being 3pm which is very late as it is we got our room at 5:10pm. They took another 1 hour to transfer our luggage from one room to another. The 1st room allotted had a strong polish like chemical smell and we were only offered room on the lower floors. Wasted almost 3 hours on this nonsense. Highly disappointed for a big brand hotel like this one   ,2,
"if you decide to try this hotel, manage your expectation and be prepared the following: - very cold and rude attitude from the receptionist. she doesn't even dare to look at you when she communicate with you - if you travel with your partner, make sure both of you bring your key card to everywhere, including gym, swimming pool, sky park etc, as they won't let you in if you leave 1 key card in the room. they have no system to check and don't dare to do that. this rule, you won't be informed from the check-in process so you won't aware of - even you have you key card, when you go to the gym, need two times checking just a few steps away. - the swimming pool - which seem to be their proud, i went there on sat at 3pm, i was so annoyed with the construction noise. when checking with…",2,
Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 4 days. Pretty pricey but got a room for $358 USD night. Got 4th floor Garden view. Not the best view but the room was great. One of the best beds I've ever slept on. Everything was pretty pricey though. Casino was fantastic. The best part is the top floor infinity pool that will put you in awe. You can see the whole city while swimming....Great Photo Ops. Also a nice vantage point for the laser/light show on the harbour.,5,
"The iconic infinity pool is probably the highlight of Marina Sands and that is probably it. What I mean is; that there is nothing exemplary apart from the pool. Things are how they are supposed to be.  Although, the view from the rooms is another feather for sure. Quite pretty.  My room was facing the Gardens by the bay and it was breathtaking when it rained.  The food; to be honest; was alright. I have had better food at a lot of places. The food just did not stand out. Overall the stay was pleasant and the pool (although crowded) was a place to be. MRT was close by which made it easier to commute.  Note - Always go with a notion to loose money in Casino and this will make you win :P Cheers.",4,
"View is amazing however hospitality can be improved manifolds, stewarts can be more courteous,maybe have a smile & greet the guests warmly  If you need a calm & serene view....opt for tower 3 rooms facing gardens by the bay....they're bit economical.....if you like lights...then opt for rooms facing merlion view :)",4,
"Rooms are comfortably huge with solid glass floor to ceiling wall that gave us a fantastic view of the bay, day and night. We saved a lot of time, effort and cash on taxi fares because no need to go outdoors to get to the mall because it is interconnected to the hotel. My kids particularly loved the ""boat shaped"" top floor infinity pool! We had a really great time! ",5,
"You must visit the top of this hotel. Amazing views and a check mark on your list! ;-) It cost S$23 if you don't go to the restaurant/bar (Cest la vie). However, if you even buy a beer (S$16) at the bar, you go up for free. Up there, the bar has two sides. Check out both sides to see where you want to sit and enjoy.",5,
"We spend one night with 2 triples rooms on Club Rooms, perfect in all points except 2 : - Very bad extra bed for the third person compare to the main one, specially with the price they charge it. - They are making renovation on the swiming pool level with a lot of noise, it make the view not so nice. The minimum for this type of hotel is to annonce it at the reservation ! Anyway it's a great place to recommand, I will go back for sure. Maybe next time I will rate it with 5 stars.",4,
"I stayed there for three days and it was a fantastic experience i had, Me and my wife enjoyed alot the property. From check in to check out it was perfect, though the lobby was crowded and noisy but its worth staying at MBS. SANDS properties are always a HIT in itself. Rooms are big, spacious, cleaned & the view from the room was outstanding, you can see almost the entire singapore attractions from the room. Swimming pool is out of the world but its very crowded because of its attraction. One thing is really good that the only hotel guests can enjoy the pool and outsiders can only visit the sky deck. Buffet spread was fabulous and food was delicious. Hotel staff is very helpful and kind, service is really good. staying in MBS is like a dream come true. I must recommend all to…",5,
"Overall we were very comfortable in the massive hotel room - nicely fitted out, but disappointing that no fresh milk was in the fridge for tea/coffee making and when I called and asked for a small jug it was going to cost $SGD4 - so declined! When you are paying SGD$575 for the room - breakfast inclusive would be nice! We were disappointed with our dinner at Ce La Vi too as the doof doof music in the outside bar also piped through the Restaurant made a romantic dinner impossible. We were really looking forward to the pool - but unfortunately it was the SEA games weekend and the hotel was fully booked and every man, woman and child staying in the hotel appeared to be in the Pool day and night!",4,
"Check-in was moderately quick, although I feel that much can be improve upon to speed up the process. Stayed at Tower 1 Premier Room (Garden View), room was luxuriously big and spacious. However view was slightly obstructed by the horizontal support structures. The wifi is complimentary for 24hrs, probably because I only stayed for a night, not sure for those that stayed longer.  One thing to note is the ""automatically-charged-to-your-room"" fridge. Unless you do not mind paying for what I'd say overpriced beverages and chocolate bars, I suggest not even moving or even touching any of those items. However you may request to have your own fridge at a minimal fee.   The iconic hotel which boasts one of the highest infinity pool is a place you might want to go for a dip in the…",4,
"This hotel is at the opposite end of the spectrum scale to boutique.  Three massive towers topped with the swimming pool and gardens provide spectacular views of Singapore and the ocean. The hotel is connected to a shopping complex containing multiple high end stores and restaurants.    It’s not cheap, though we did manage a free upgrade and a late checkout. The room was large, well fitted out, though be careful using the fridge as charges are racked up automatically when anything inside is moved.   When using the pool area both room keys need to be taken to get two people into the area. During our stay the area adjacent the pool was undergoing renovation, which was disappointing as there was no notification or allowance at the time of booking, for this. The pool area suffered…",4,
Take a ride to the top to Ku Da Ta Restaurant. Fantastic views of Singapore. Food and drinks are really good and the swimming pool is to die for (only can be used by Hotel Guests).,5,
"Stunning hotel with incredible service. I have no idea how this place has any negative reviews? It's has some of the worlds best shopping, has fantastic restaurants and is close to all kinds of transport options. The pool of course is amazing and let's face it, everyday your in Singapore and your not staying at MBS you will be looking up thinking 'I should have booked it'.",5,
"Me and my wife were on honeymoon. The hotel is quite good, has a lot of amenities and the views from the Infinity Pool are fantastic. But it is very expensive, is a good choice for staying one night in order to access the Infinity Pool to live the experience.",4,
"well, I didn't expect to be writing this review like below....  We arrived at the hotel on Saturday with high expectations given how much we paid for 3 nights here and it was the last stop on our Honeymoon.  When we arrived we were greeted by the bell boy and he took our bags, we walked into the hotel and it was manic, people everywhere and the check in queue was massive. I work in the travel industry and I know hotels get busy given I've travelled to lots of places but this was crazy. and it all made sense on the Monday.   We finally got checked in and we were given a room on the 27th Floor.   We took the lift and entered our room. It was big and spacious but there was no wow factor. Disappointment again. There was a balcony which surprised us a little.   The bathroom was…",3,
"It's my dream to stay in this hotel. The moment I check in this hotel, I feel very excited about it. Firstly about the room, very spacious, super clean, superb view,service staff very helpful and on time whenever we request something.  About the infinity pool, nice pool and also awesome scenery and best for photo taking. All I can say I'll be back for my next staycation",4,
"Management should notify would-be guests in advance that the rooftop pool area is undergoing noisy construction prior to taking the $500+ expected for a room. 1000's of pool goers are forced into a narrow compressed space with no shade & inadequate facilities. Toilets can only be located down several flights of slippery stairs & crossing damp carpet - hence the over chlorinated pool water trying to mask the unthinkable. I've had more personal space in the local council pool! No swim was complete without kicks & bumps from strangers & splashing from noisy kids.The pool is the draw card yet rather than expand this undersized space to comfortably accommodate the guests of 2,400+ guest rooms they are putting in (another!!) Wolfgang Puck restaurant??!! Perhaps it's a ploy to drive…",1,
I stayed in this hotel while on a business trip. The evenings were luxurious taking breathtaking views of the city from pool side restaurant at top of the hotel.  Would recommend everyone visiting Singapore to stay in this hotel for at least a night to experience luxury at its best.,5,
"if you are in Singapor and stay at the Holiday Inn on Orchard road. Check with the front desk for information about the getting to the wonderful Marina Sands  you will love it. And it is kid friendly.The towers are unbelievable, great stores inside for shopping, good food. Then go to the top of the building and sit on the boat on top of the two towers and look out over Singapor you will love the sights.",5,
"I stayed there on a business trip - my employer held a company conference in the conference centre next to the hotel. The hotel itself is worth a visit, at least. I don't know whether I'd stay in it on my own - the place is a bit too large for my taste, and the area is a bit away from everything I wanted to visit, except perhaps Chinatown.   That said, I had a large well-appointed room with a view to kill for; the view from the rooftop certainly made it worth it to get up early in the morning; the rooftop pool is worth visiting if only to say I swam in that pool; the service was faultless. About the only complaint I have is that there was some noise from the entertainment areas next to the hotel.",5,
"If you want something here, you got it. Luxury check. Outstanding service check. Rooftop pool check. Shopping check. Casino check. It was all grand and beautifully decorated to the point of being overwhelming.  I stayed two nights just so that I could use the pool; however, everybody else wanted to use it too and I found it very much overcrowded on several occasions. I asked one of the attendants if there was a quieter time to come back and he responded that 8pm was more quiet, but still quite busy so I never made it in the pool.  I did enjoy the in-room dining and the morning breakfast buffet, but be prepared to pay through the nose for everything, it's quite overpriced; however, luxury usually is. Upgrade if you can and get an ocean view on a higher floor, it's amazing. Would…",4,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a day for the sake of experience but our stay was fantastic. Though we had booked two Garden View rooms, it was upgraded to a family suite with the ocean as well as garden view. It had two bedrooms with king sized bed and a family lounge.The view from the room was fantastic. we were able to see the laser shows in the evening from the comfort of the room itself. The rooms had all the facilities which a 5* hotel should have and more.  We had requested for an early check-in. Though there was a que for check-in, it was fast and smooth.  The rooftop infinity swimming pool was a little crowded but still the view from there was amazing.  The buffet breakfast had lots of options to choose from.",5,
"There is no other hotel in Singapore  like Marina Bay Sands.  We booked standard room with suggestions to live on a top floor.. When we arrived, lady on reception was so friendly and she gave us free upgrade to much bigger room on 53 floor. We were so happy. The view from our room was fantastic! Next day we enjoyed delicious food and fabulous view in the 57 floor. It was a feeling like you can touch the sky, and all your dreams will come true. I'm so happy about the experience that I have got in the beautiful hotel. We will definitely come back again!",5,
"Our suite was huge, our concierge service attentive & our business, meetings & work were conducted in comfort.  Then we managed to relax on the Sky Deck in the infinity pool with its fabulous Singapore views & finished up with drinks & dinner at Ce'st La Vie. Our break was perfection, as was last years visit.   We ant wait to return! Cocktail, anyone?",5,
We stayed here at the end of a cruise for 2 nights.  The room itself located on the 37th floor was fantastic.  Really spacious and the bathroom was huge.  The infinity pool was lovely however it was spoilt but loud and unruly kids.  At one point a family of 13 descended onto just 2 of the sunbeds next to us and essentially drove everyone else away from that area.  We found the hotel far too busy and far more children running around than we expected from this type of hotel.  Parts of the hotel were also quite shabby in places with wallpaper and paint coming away from the walls.  There is plenty to do and easy to access however we would not chose to stay here again given the price.  The hotel staff were great though and service was good at reception and around the pool.,3,
"It's a huge building, great location. Love the infinity pool. Too many people but everything is in a good management. Will come back here again!  The room was spacious and clean. Warm and simple cozy interior (i was hoping more luxurios than that). ",4,
"I stayed for 2 nights. This hotel is really good.clean room,good service,good food .the skypark is awesome.the rooftop pool is awesome as well.we can see singapore city from the skypark.and its really beautiful at night.the price quit reasonble.",5,
"If you can stay at least one night there during your stay in Singapore, do it!!! It was a dream coming true to me! The pool is amazing, the food buffer was amazing, the assistants were amazing. I've got no complaints at all!",5,
"We took taxi from changi airport to hotel, (please note free shuttle no longer available). The hotel building look magnificent when approaching. Three block towers named tower 1, 2 and 3, and they are all linked together.   Each tower has their own check in counters however you can check in at any counter at any tower. Check in waiting time was fast even though many people queueing for check in.  We had a garden view room with kingsize bed and balcony, personally I think garden view room has a better view than city view room especially at night when the 'gardens by the bay' all light up. Nice clean room, well maintained,  however no bathtub in the shower room. We requested a baby cot with no additional charge. Free wifi for guest covered almost all area in hotel.  Infinity pool…",5,
"I often come here to stayover or what now people known it as ""Staycation"". The view here at night is beautiful, the hotel room was clean. The shops here are like internationally well known brands. The food was pretty expensive but it's nice. However i suggest people not to get the local food like chicken rice here as i find it overly charged.",5,
"Though very busy, great hotel with excellent service, quality and restaurants. Phenomenal roof-top swimming pool... Very close to Bayfront MRT (underground) station and convenient for strolling around the Marina Bay Basin. We stayed in a Club Room with City view and enjoyed the marvellous breakfast, afternoon teas and food in the Club Restaurant on level 55.",5,
"Stayed there 3 nights on business and holiday. So far this is the one of the best hotels we have visited in Singapore. Big hotel with over 2500 rooms but at club level we received a warm and courteous service. There is breakfast, mid day snacks, evening tea and cocktails all included in the price. This is a must visit hotel since it is a engineering marvel. Pool is only open to hotel residents but still crowded. Good size gym. Hotel is connected to a mall and a casino.",4,
"As a 'normal' hotel, MBS is excellent in its own right - great service, lovely room, spacious and inviting public spaces - but when you add the rooftop area - wow! This is such an iconic hotel, and the pool/bar areas are only open to residents, so if you want to experience the infinity pool on the 57th floor you have to stay. And it really is an experience, we do a lot of travelling and we were totally blown away - it's like something out of a movie set and then some.  To give a little more detail, we arrived after an overnight flight at 10am and I'd emailed beforehand to ask for an early check-in if possible, plus a non-smoking room on a high floor. They met all our requests in a very friendly manner and also upgraded us to a fantastic city view room which was huge - you could…",5,
"On previous visits to Singapore, I'd often found myself pondering the question - 'is staying at the Marina Bay Sands worthwhile?' my answer in short - YES. I'd been through the lobby and through the shops on several other occasions, seen the hoards of tourists bumbling about, the Trip Advisor photos of the super crowded infinity pool with barely a free spot along the edge and the seemingly 'sterile' commercial nature of the whole establishment, however decided to stay against all of that (on a whim purely by chance) and certainly did not regret it. The room was generous, with astonishing view of the city and real 5 star facilities. The hotel staff pleasant, friendly and professional. yes, the pool was crowded, but did it matter? Not at all. The overall experience was very well…",5,
"The pool was cold, confusing and multiple check-in reception desks and because of the size of the place, there were always lots and lots of people - too many sometimes. The views from the top were pretty cool and a great place to have breakfast - there is also a club / bar on the top floor too with overpriced drinks.  Rooms are nothing special and the building itself is more impressive from the outside than the inside. There is a multi level shopping centre with most shops and brands in the basement and they often do fireworks around the back by the lake.   I personally wouldn't stay there again for the price - it was expensive and brash but ok for two nights to say I've done it.",4,
"My biggest mistake was booking three nights at Marina Bay Sands during Golden Week. The entire hotel transformed into Chinatown. Not being Chinese, I was a bit turned off by the hotel's focus on all things Chinese. At one Chinese restaurant on the ground floor, my family was turned away at the door at 10pm although we could see a couple of empty tables inside. My guess is that they only wanted to serve deep-pocketed Chinese diners. The hotel itself is incredible and the Infinity Pool on the roof is to die for. If I go back again, you can bet it won't be during a Chinese holiday and I'm spending every minute in the pool...",3,
Marina bay is a great hotel. Rooms are still new and shinny. Great amenities in the rooms. Nothing you can really complain about room wise. I did enjoy me stay here but I don't think I'd stay here again for the simple reason that it was just too busy for me. Think Disneyland in the summer. But when you have three towers for 57 or so floors it's really no surprise that there are ppl everywhere. We had breakfast in the roof top restaurant (can't remember what it's called) and it was fabulous. Great buffet selection with very friendly staff and amazing views. Pool on the roof is also fabulous. The sky park was being renovated while we were there so couldn't utilise it as much as we would have liked but still got some amazing pics from up there. Highlight of the hotel would be the…,4,

"A one night stay for the family (2 adults, 2 children - age 8 & 10), as a sort of stay-cation/Singapore farewell.  Having stayed at this hotel many times for business, the hotel staff was significantly and memorably exceeding our expectations. In addition to an amazing complimentary upgrade, the manager - Mr. Ramesh Govindasamy and the service specialist Ms. Mickey, looked to pamper our stay at every turn. They provided complimentary pickup service from our Singapore home, in-room checkin, afternoon tea and an all around fantastic experience that will be remembered for years!  Thank you to your Mr Ramesh and to your wonderful team!",5,
"There is nothing wrong with the hotel.  It is new, modern, grand, well maintained and clean with large rooms and plenty of amenities.  It also has that infinity pool that everyone gets their photo taken at!  If you want to pretend you're in a sort of high humidity version of Vegas, it is perfect - it is right on top of the casino and shopping complex.  However, if you want to explore Singapore proper, this isn't the ideal hotel.  It has a mass transit station, but the system is complex and this station isn't central to anything - so expect a couple of changes.  If you're in Singapore for a layover for a couple of days, go for it.  If you're really looking to see more of Singapore, then stay in Singapore central.",3,
"This hotel is consider a huge hotel, we come there and we went to the pool, it was Amazing!!!! many people enjoy swimming while the pool is big and at the top of the roof of the Hotel. We enjoy Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore",5,
"My sister and I were at Marina Bay Sands earlier this year. It was a great experience for us since it was the first time for us staying at the hotel. Room so large and very clean! Swimming pool on the top of the building with amazing marina bay was amazing. Good, service and security were great! Nothing like this. Good job management!",5,
The views are great from the top. It's windy and the beer tastes so good when the weather is perfect.,4,
"It's a great Hotel, great building and very well located in Singapore. First the shape of the building has almost become a landmark for Singapore. The boat on top, at 57th floor, has a great infinity swimming pool, allowed only for the residents, a Skydeck Club and a Ce La Vi (formerly Ku De Ta) restaurant. Great view from the pool, Pool management is good, towel management is good but a lot of people! Skydeck is a nice bar, great view but not great food. The lobby area is too big spanning across three towers and the main reception is at Tower 1. If you are coming from airport, tower 1 comes first. So that's convenient. The lobby has connections to the convention center, Helix bridge etc. I stayed in Tower 3 and the room size there is not great. Could have been better. The…",4,

"Staying at this hotel was literally my dream, I was so fascinated by the photos that are all over the Internet.   I cannot describe my disappointment, check in was veeeeeery slow, no real dress code for receptionists. Of course they had a uniform and apparently some recommendations about make up and manicure, but they have no clue how to keep it. The girl that did my check in had half of her nail polish gone. Looks very cheap.  The hotel itself is HUGE and u can get lost very easily.  The swimming pool  looks amazing , but its it deep at all and its full of kids . Definitely not a place to relax.",3,
"Lets be simple and straight. The facilities and the location matches to the expectation. View from the room is breathtaking. Pool is a bit crowded most of the time, but definitely is the best experince inside the hotel with its Infinity view. And when gambling is on your mind, just the perfect Hotel since they have the largest casino as part of their property.  Few pics attached.",5,
"We are staying for 4 nights and chose to upgrade to the Club.  Oh so good, nothing is too much trouble. All the staff have been extremely helpful and courteous.  In the Club Restaurant we have been empressed by Jesan and Miles, thank you ladies. ",5,
"We started our honeymoon with my wife in this hotel, When We were at the reception we told that we were on our honeymoon and they upgraded our room to a suite which was very generous and kind of them. Thank you a lot.  The room had a great view of Singapore, and the back of the room had a amazing view of the Gardens Bay The Bay. The room It self was comfy and the space was very good for a suite.    We went to the infinity pool up at the terrace, The view Is nothing I can tell about, You need to see it yourselves. It is stunning. However don't expect it to be like the pictures because the pool is always crowded and too noisy , People are trying to take pictures on the edges people jumping to the pool etc. But It is something you need to see.  The Hotel itself has a connection to…",4,
"By far, aside from the fact that this hotel actually operates like three different hotels, (one for each ""leg""  of the hotel) and the sheer size of the integrated casino resort; is their 57th floor swimming pool!  One is not just, in awe of the engineering that took place but is presented a fantastic view of Singapore's skyline! The hotel obviously caters mainly to their Sands Casino customers but the non gambling guests have the 4 level mall at the podium/basement level. Great stores and eating places. Boasts of world renown chefs like Wolgang Puck and Mario Batali. The rooms are average and amenities could be better for such a grand hotel. A definite must visit when one is in Singapore. A great birds eye view during the Formula1 Singapore leg usually in September.  Do note,…",4,
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands, although just 1 night but giving me a mixed feelings like what other reviewer title mentioned. I will try to make it as subtle as possible because it was really on both corner of positives and negatives.  Our expectations when we reached the hotel and heard about the hotel reputation was really high. First tip; always manage your expectation, fellow guests lest you will be a bit disappointed like us.   A hotel is a service industry, hence both component hardware and software must be at both tip top condition. Marina Bay Sands hardware was almost in a perfect condition. The rooftop sky park and the infinity pool lived up to its name. We had good time there albeit very crowded. Seats provided near the pool were too little to accommodate the number of…",2,
"Nice rooms - had a view of the gardens. Was a good time as laneway festival was on.  Bathrooms and Rooms clean. Spent most of the day at the infinity pool and ku de ta at night. Drinks were pricy but its like that every where in Singapore.  Ordered room service most days. Ordered some wine but that took really long and when I called to ask why, they said they had to get it from tower 3! (was staying in tower 1)",4,
"Great to walk along Marina Bay to see the structures of the unique Marina...clean, nice and walk in the night would be best as the lightings of the buildings and hotels complements the view of the scenic Marina Bay.",5,
"(+1) Excellent location. (-1) Poor signage throughout MBS and you will have a hard time if this was your first trip to the hotel. (+1) Spacious & beautiful Premier rooms. (-1) Below average beddings. (+1) Great view from Balcony. (-1) Poorly maintained Balcony.  Why I gave only one star? Starting from the carpark, it was a nightmare, the signage were horrible and MBS should visit Suntec for a learning experience. Took 10mins with my luggage in toll to find my way to the hotel lobby only to be met by a long check-in queue, made uneasy by roaming staff who randomly use their devices to help secure room preferences for people they approach not in order if queue, and made unpleasant by staff scolding pleasant guests. I.e. the queue was long and a nice little girl was quietly moving…",1,
"We loved our stay at MBS! We had a family room with a city view, one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. The room & bathroom was spacious & the bed was great.  Great location & easy to get anywhere with the MRT just outside the hotel.  We had no meal in the hotel so cannot comment on dining. We also did not use the spa.  The infinity pool is awesome!  The staff was great as well.  Can really recommend staying here, will definitely return.",4,
"The website mentions that there are renovation works in tower two, but  when the work is happening, lying by the pool during daytime hours is not quiet.  We paid for a club room, as people had mentioned the queues for checking in and we were upgraded, so had an absolutely amazing room with a city view.  The breakfast choice included was excellent.  I would really recommend having an evening drink on the balcony of the bar at the top of tower one.",4,
"I stayed in a Premium City View room and was in awe every time I stepped into the room, especially in the evening. The room was spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed the perks of the no entry fee when visiting SkyPark. We made sure to swim daily in the infamous infinity pool, it was usually more crowded in the evening than in the day. Being on top of the hotel looking out over the beautiful city felt surreal and was absolutely breathtaking. The hotel was close to everything, MRT, shopping centre, restaurants and more (Garden By The Bay). This was the first visit and definitely won't be the last!",5,
"Let's be honest - you're staying here because of the swimming pool, and that pool is incredible! The views from the rooftop and the pool are simply astonishing. Room was a good size, very clean, had all the necessary amenities.   The hotel is also right at an MRT station and many of Singapore's top attractions. Great location. Only thing that needs improving is the shower head :)",5,
"This hotel is luxury at it best.  Great place to base yourself while in Singapore.  The hotel has fantastic views from nearly every part of the hotel.  There is a shopping centre linked to the hotel with mostly exclusive and designer shops.  There was not much for the average person.  There is a lot to do and see within walking distance to the hotel, if you can stand the heat.   The suite we had was fantastic.  It was large, spacious and very clean.  The skydeck pool was fantastic, the views were also fantastic, the only down to all of this was that it was so crowded that you had to fight for space and also for a lounge chair, which took away from the whole experience.  The hotel foyer was also very busy and booking in and out was very hectic.  Would we stay there again? No, it…",5,
"The infinity pool was amazing, definitely was worth the money. It wasn't so crowded as mentioned in the previous comments. However room was like a one in a 4* hotel. Optimal for one day stay just for the pool experience.",5,
"The pool and rooftop are worth the price of admission.  The kids will like it (and so will the adults). Yes, the lobby is cavernous and zoo like, but the excellent service and nice rooms more than make up for it. The concierges were exceedingly helpful. The location is good, a short walk to Gardens by the bay and Merlion.",5,
"This hotel has the best view in Singapore, whichever side your room is.  Facing the city and Singapore River or facing the sea and Garden by the Bay.  The hotel is linked to a shopping mall with many shops and restaurants.  There are a lot of things to do within walking distance - exhibition hall, the amazing garden, theatre, etc.  The rooms/bathrooms are huge, with full width and full length window.  The infinity pool is a must-try.  It is the largest infinity pool at this height ( 57th storey ) and the view is 2nd to none.  It is quite windy and chilly though.   The hotel is huge, and the service is very impersonal and cold.  There is no effort to make the me feel welcome.",4,
"This hotel is stunning but too busy for the staff to pay attention to detail. It was a disappointing experience. We had booked adjoining rooms months prior to our visit. Upon check in we were taken up to our room. When we asked why the 2nd adjoining room wasn't open the porter unlocked it and we walked thru. Our first reaction was that housekeeping hadn't been yet (it was 6pm) but no there was luggage, clothes, phones, iPads etc in the room... people were still in it. Im sure they would have been thrilled to know we were in their room unsupervised and let in by the staff! Once we realised the room was still occupied we called reception and told them. They sent someone up to lock it and said they did not have 2 adjoining rooms available for us-how can this occur when we booked…",3,
"MBS has always been another stop to visit when I went to Singapore. It was my second time to be here and still like the whole ambiance. We can sit and just enjoying the calm and relaxing nuance.   At that time, MBS became a spot for pre-wedding photoshoot. The flowers were purple-ish reflected through the water. I was at MBS from 5 at the evening to 11 night. It was calm and nicer at night. :) I can see the light show with songs and let my mind wander.",5,
"We stayed for two nights at MBS before heading home to Denmark. We had splurged and booked a Club room, ie a room on one of the upper floors (44th) and with Club benefits. The room had a spectacular city view and was very nicely and discretely decorated. Breakfast end afternoon nibbles/cocktails in the Club lounge were a treat and the Sky deck is just absolutely amazing. Room service impeccable. We did not want to venture outside MBS at all!",5,
Watching all the people enjoying the pool (and taking photos of themselves) was a great experience.  The hotel was very nice and all of my photographs of it look spectacular.  Probably would not stay again just because of the price.,4,
"We stayed overnight on the way home from Turkey.  My husband wanted to stay only at the Marina Bay Sands because he wanted to experience the infinity pool.  Because I booked at the last minute,  I had to agree to the high rate (SGD614) but no regrets.  We arrived in Singapore at 5am so we were at the hotel by 6am.  They registered us but as there was no room available yet,  we were given access passes to the 57th meantime.  People were already starting to secure their places by the pool at 6:30am!    We decided to kill time by having breakfast at Sky on 57th and by the time we were done,  the pool area was getting crowded.  Thankfully our room was ready by 9am so we decided to take a shower and a nap.  The room had superb views of the marina.  When you open the door and put the…",5,
"We were so lucky to have stayed in the Marina Bay Hotel, as it is one of the most interesting architectural creations in the world. The pool up there and the water wall creates an illusion one is on tne brink of abyss... Being in Singapore one should spend for at least one night in this wondrous place!",5,
"Was in Singapore for 15 day work project. Decided to stay here and surprise my wife. We needed a nice and relaxing getaway after a long working stint. We have always wanted to stay at the Sands, and finally I managed to get a room there. (For some, it's well saved/sacrificed money spent). Upon arrival, was greeted by the door guys with a genuine and sincere smile. Assisted us with our luggage and directed us to the check in counter.   Here is where I started to get frustrated. We booked our room via the website and I personally called reservations to make sure my requests are noted down. Nothing demanding, just asked for a higher floor (my wife is a light sleeper), and not to have a connecting room. While in line, I had someone with a handheld device assisting me with the check…",5,
"MBS certainly overwhelmed me. It aims to please guests and as far as I am concerned, I was impressed. From the moment you walk into the hotel lobby, you will be filled with awe - incredibly tons of people coming and going. The open space. Natural lighting. The view above you. It feels overwhelming and quite intimidating. There are three towers for the hotel rooms, and access to some rooms however may not necessarily be convenient since there is also one set of elevator per floor. I happened to be in a room facing the gardens so on that side, expect to walk to get to the lifts. Rooms are spacious. The nice thing about this side of the hotel is that all rooms have a veranda. So you trade this for a view of the city if you want to stay on the other side of the hotel. Amenities are…",5,
"Was told by guest relations that I couldn't bring in a mere 3 helium balloons. I found that absurd as no other hotel has such restrictions, even 6 star ones. I'd understand if they wanted their vendor to be the sole supplier of room decoration packages (which typically include over 50 helium balloons for ceiling deco) but seriously, all the quibble over 3 balloons. For a hotel that charges premium rates, one would not expect such a demonstration of penny pinching and poor customer care. Unbecoming of a supposed 'icon'.        ",1,
Great place with great amenities. Superb pool on the top. Excellent supportive staff. Great buffet for breakfast and very good Indian cusines. Good club at the top. Suite room is awesome. Experienced Luxury feeling.,5,
"I should explain the reason behind my comments - we initially stayed in a hostel in Singapore, and forked out for our final night in Marina Bay.... we had been staring at this big imposing building all weekend and talking about how great it was going to be when we got there.  It lived up to it completely, but it's a massive hotel and we found that 1 night just wasn't enough because we were trying to rush around to be in the pool, casino, shops, restaurants, chocolate buffet etc.  My recommendations would be to stay here for 2nights plus to get the full experience without feeling like you're rushing around.  Definitely take in Gardens by the Bay... I was really surprised by just how beautiful I found it!  We stayed in the cheapest tower(!) but had great views of the gardens by…",5,
"Stayed for couple of days. I specially loved the view of the sea from the room. However, what I didn't like (maybe just not my taste) was that it was very crowded given that its part of a shopping arena I think, and also that one has to switch towers to use the gym.. My ratings of the essentials would be as below:  Room: Good Food: Decent Location: Convenient ",4,
"We all know that space is a premium in Singapore but the Marina Bay Sands really pamper you with space and luxury. Super large room with an equally oversized King bed. The bathroom is almost twice the size of the bathroom at home and comes with luxurious amenities. Internet connection was blazing fast.  We were given a high floor and had fantastic view of the city. Due to the unobstructed views, we were also able to view the nightly musical water fountain displays.  Excellent service throughout the hotel and a massive choice of food for breakfast. The breakfast area can get a little busy and crowded like everywhere else in the hotel.   Visited the infinity pool on the rooftop and found that most were just dipping and taking selfies / wefies rather than swimming. Kinda amusing. …",5,
Been there thrice and I would comeback again :) nice relaxing pool always crowded. The hotel room is fab. The service is good but slow!,5,
"Upon check in on the 22nd of June the receptionist who checked us in was so helpful and friendly. We mentioned our flight back to Australia was at 10:30pm the next day, but she was nice enough to explain that we could check out and leave our luggage at the luggage holding desk and then have a shower in the hotel before going to the airport around 6pm. However, the following day at 6:30pm we were very disappointed to find out we could not go for a shower. When we got to the luggage holding desk, the guy told us the shower on the 55th floor opens at 6pm and that we just have to go to the reception desk to receive key cards. Unfortunately, they told us we cannot use the facilities because they were under ""unexpected"" renovations. I work in a hotel industry back in Australia, and I…",2,
We went up all the way to the top. It is so windy and beautiful lights up there. We did not stay long but i love it very much. Worth the entrance. i advice though for the rest to go there during daytime. ,5,
"For all the very well-known, excellent facilities, wonderful views, amazing pool, great rooms, good breakfasts etc. etc. this hotel gets 5 stars without any doubt.  However it is disappointing in several aspects.  The hotel is very big, and has become very impersonal.  There are enough staff, but they don't seem to care about the customers and are often not as well trained as you would hope.  It is also very expensive, even by Singapore standards and they really charge for extras (e.g. breakfast if it's not included).  Worst is the hotel transport service to the airport which at S$120 is way too much.  Even worse when I wanted to arrange the car to pick up my wife from the airport they wanted another S$120 for me to ride in the car on the way so that I could meet her -…",3,
"Like many others I stayed here for the hotel's location and the infinity pool. and I wasn't disappointed with either. Good access to Gardens by the bay (if a little convoluted), shops and the waterfront area plus there is an MRT station underneath.  We chose a garden view room for the amazing views over the gardens and water. To ensure a high floor you have to go for a club room or better which guarantees you 35th floor and while pricey it is incrementally not much more than the ""cheaper"" rooms but gets you complimentary wifi, full breakfast, afternoon tea and a 2 hours cocktail and canape hour where drinks flow freely so was a reasonable deal.  The pool was sensational as many have commented and yes there is some construction going on but I didn't find it too much of a…",4,
excellent hotel..we took one night there but later we felt shortage of time so 2 nights ll be enough to explore whole hotel.very nice place.can enjoy more if we have enough time.great location of hotel.,5,
the hotel is just amazing.very  nice location.rooms are huge and very clean.breakfast was very good.we didnt expect indian breakfast in marina bay sands but it was there..awesome experience.must go place,5,
"Stay here on June 22-24,2015 for our second time. Comparing our stay 3 years ago, this visit, when we check in, the receptionist said please come back in 1 hour and our room ready on time. Our bad experiences before ( 3y ago ), we came to check in at 3pm and our rooms are not ready ( we booked 3rooms, not even 1 room ready ). We came back @4pm, still not ready even i've tried to let them know that I traveled with my 2yo twins. Finally we get the rooms at 5PM! ( because of this horrible situations and i got so disappointed, they upgraded me to premier rooms n complimentary vouchers ). Quite nice efforts from MBS team to make their guests not being scared to stay here again because of their bad experiences.   This visit, I want to say thank you to Zhan Wei who clean up our room in…",5,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 4 days late last year as apart of our honeymoon trip, what an experience. The level of details in attention and service were fantastic, always greeted with smiles from staff. Room was packed and cleaned well, the Premier Room we stayed had amazing city view. As for dinning, world class restaurant or local eatery are both available within short walking distance in the complex. Highly recommending a visit to the infinity pool on the top, ticking off the bucket list. Until next time, thank you! ",5,
"The hotel was an average service, but the mall and the iconic infinity pool drove me to reserve in it. WIFI service went off for almost 1 day because of some technical issues. You have to change elevators in order to reach the pool level. Moreover there is more than one reception so it helped to check in and out faster. One more thing the pool area is only allowed to be visited by the hotel guests. Visitors are allowed to visited a nearby restaurant",3,
"Even if you do not intend on staying here you MUST take the trip up to the observation deck. The views are spectacular, especially after dusk. What an incredible building. Absolutely loved it. The infinity pool is just mind blowing. It is a must see even if you are only there for a stop over.",5,
This is the first hotel review I am writing. Im either too busy or just not bothered to write these sort of thing but I was so disappointed with my stay and had to let others know.  1. Why do people all over the world pay a premium to stay at MBS? yes for the Skypark. However big part of the pool area was under construction making the seating area significantly smaller. Also not sure if the pool chairs are always positioned so close but it felt like the chairs from the construction area were pushed out to the rest of the pool area. It was so crowded when we finally found seats we were constantly bothered by others sitting literally an inch next to us. Guests should be notified of this when they book if there are work being done affecting the stay in anyway. And I booked direct…,1,
"The hotel is, well, just too good. The best part is the rooftop infinity pool which is the USP of this place. The view from the pool is breathtakingly beautiful and you could sip away your worries as you stare at the amazing Singapore skyline.  The rooms provide a good view and given an option choose the room with city side quay view. Food options are good and there is an excellent food complex within the hotel premises.",5,
You must visit to see the pool and to see all of the amenities that this place has to offer. You have to stay at the hotel to see the pool but the splurge is worth it!,5,
"You may be thinking that you can stay so many places for cheaper. However, I promise you will not regret splurging to stay here. The use of the infinity pool and the amazing views that it has to offer are almost worth it alone. On top of that the hotels customer service is fantastic, and the bed is to die for.",5,
"We stayed in mbs for one night under a delux room, no body help us move the luggage when we arrive tower 1 entrance by a taxi. It was not a busy time 830am, but staff are focus on watch this magnificent building.   We were ignored at very beginning and later I doubt if they found we only booked  delux room.  Cannot find staff willing to help you in such a long walk path, we have to brainstorm by ourselves to find out that check out counter can check in as well.  We really don't feel any welcome during c/i, understand we only book delux room so maybe cannot get a higher level room( actually my friend stayed in 30+floor with same rate, maybe he is handsome), but it's really unfair to get a 3rd floor corner side room for a early arrival guest, I assume first come first get…",1,
"Room was amazing as you would expect for price but the view, service, roof top area plus location were all incredible extras. This hotel is a real icon in Singapore the facilities justify the extra expense. We felt thoroughly spoilt. I believe its a must do on the Singapore list. Snacks and drinks at roof top surprisingly not that expensive.",5,
The draw for this Hotel is the pool.  They are renovating and jackhammering away all day right now.  There is no mention of this or consideration offered.  The seating space is also cut in half and the elevator service is interrupted leaving guests dealing with surly security guards and confusing staircase access.  Forget about ordering food or drink... hours long waits.  45 minutes to check-in set the stage for a painful stay.  Travel to Singapore often for business and for the money there are MANY better hotels to choose from.  In the 5 star range I cant think of any that aren't better.     They need to fix their customer service and value for money in a hurry.  At least get the pool working as the only reason people stay here is to take skyline selfies in the pool.,2,
"Without doubt the MBS is a stunning building that stands proud as a feature of the Singapore skyline. However those booking MBS need to be aware that this is NOT a hotel set up that you would expect. This is a massive developement under the name Marina Bay Sands and it would be easy to expect all of the facilities within the complex to be under the contol of the hotel this is not the case. Realistically for the average hotel guest the venue only consists of the rooms and the pool area, as many areas that would normally be part of the hotel, are in fact leased out space. Now sure within the shopping complex it would be fair to assume that the shops or venues are not part of the hotel, but the restaurants and bars within the main hotel building should be operated and under the…",4,
"Early check in was possible it just took less then 10 minutes for us and Sean the receptionist was so great and handling with smile and professional.   Gregory from the call center was also helpful.  Room so specious, dont ask about the view, it was best view i ever had in singapore.   The legendary infinity pool was awesome, were there for whole day and open till 11 pm but it was too crowded in the night.   Will definetely come back. ",5,
"Very disappointed of these experience... Noisy air con, expensive room, 200$ of deposit, if you have a suite i think you have a beautiful room but for a normal room we were at the level 9 without view... Bad service. Just the swimming pool is beautiful but too much people. I think Airbnb it s better that this hotel.",1,
"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights on our way back to Sydney. It was a very large hotel and I definitely got lost a few items trying to get back to my room!   We found the staff and customer service to be really lovely and accommodating to our needs. The rooms were pretty good and the beds were very comfortable. Our view was lovely and definitely recommend a high up floor.   If it wasn't for the pool i am not sure if we would stay here again. The infinity pool is  beautiful although sometimes overcrowded. The watermelon margarita jugs we had on our last day were memorable and the bar lady was so lovely and definitely was an asset to Marina Bay.   It is quite pricey $500 a night, with no breakfast included. Although Singapore on a whole seems to be quite expensive. We stayed…",4,
" I stayed at Marina Bay Sands during 'My April' holiday. The lobby was crowded when we checked in. We were served by a receptionist who spoke poor English, but was very friendly. We ended up waiting around 25 minutes (As 5 Star, not RECOMENDED when holiday in Christmas season) to check in. The pool & the observation deck was also very crowded during this holiday time. The services not Good, but we must objective the room was great, very spacious. And the bathroom was quite large too. Overall it was a pleasant experience staying there. But if you really want to enjoy the hotel, I guess better stay away from super crowded holiday season.  The last but not least, i think everybody go there just want to selfie with 'the view of swimmingpool'.  BeHaha..haha..",3,
"Honestly only booked this hotel to swim in the amazing pool! The pool view was breathtaking and the hotel room was absolutely stunning. Paid a little bit extra for a better room which was worth it. Included breaky, drinks and snacks before dinner. Very expensive but expected as it is a luxurious hotel. Only complaint was that the pool was absolutely ice cold! Could not stay in longer than 5-10 minutes",4,
"First the good: It's an amazing piece of architecture; the views from the infinity pool are fantastic; the room is large and well appointed; beds are comfortable. I had a city-side room, and the views from the floor to ceiling windows were great. The cons: customer service is practically non-existent. I got in after a long day of sightseeing in SG, got my keycards from registration and headed up to my room in the 3rd tower, the furthest from the registration desk. After making it up to my room I find that the keycards don't work. I head back to the elevator area and use the phone to call registration, but the phone doesn't work. A porter asks what is the issue, and after explaining says to stay right there, he'll be back in 2 minutes, he just needs to drop some luggage off on…",3,
Marina Bay hotel is a must.  We visited during the afternoon and had a lovely drink right at the top of the hotel which was not overly priced.  Just lovely to sit quietly and admire the wonderful view.,5,
"This is not a 5 Star Hotel! Unfriendly customer service, stupid pool rules, a flooded bath, noisy construction at the pool side all day long. A big disappointment if you stay in the hotel because of the pool.   I can not understand all the good ratings. ",1,
"The room is great with a great view of garden by the bay. The infinity pool is also quite magnificent has it gives you a great view of Singapore skyline. however the pool is strictly not for swimming considering the number of phones/camera in the pool. If you are intending to take some photos in the pool, so remember to get some waterproof bag for it.  We got locked out of room as the keys became faulty after we placed them near our phones while swimming. So we were had to head down to the lobby in our wet attire. The staffs weren't very helpful after understanding our plight (the hotel wasn't booked under our name). We were just told to wait around. We had not money nor dry clothes with us, so spent the next hour in the lobby in our wet clothes (which eventually dried).  …",4,
"Fantastic viewing point across singapore harbor, botanical gardens and Grand Prix race track - infinity pool looked amazing - very busy hotel but appeared to be run efficiently",4,
"It was strange experience staying in Marina Bay Sands Hotel located in the middle of the city. I would recommend you to stay between 25-35 th floors with a Singapore Strait view which will definetly worth it. The rooms are big and well furnished, I really enjoyed my self during my stay. It was very amazing swinning at the 57 th floor in the pool with a beatiuful city view in the night!!! The only critism is the lobby you dont feel you are in a hotel its just like a shopping mall enterance. The personel was helpfull and trying to help you to explore the city by good recomendations.",5,
"Great experience at this enormous hotel, the view over Singapore it's absolutely gorgeous.  If you are in Singapore try it for at least 1 night. There is really nice street food market close by at Makansutra Bay where you can enjoy good see food and have a great view over the Marina Bay.",5,
"Stayed for two nights. Check in was a breeze. No waiting in line. We had a room on the 44th floor with a city view in tower 1. The floor was quiet and the lifts were super fast.  The view was amazing, floor to cieling widow so you dont miss a thing. The infinity pool was astounding. The views of the city and Gardens by the Bay gave us lots of photo opportunities but it was very busy. I went up three times. Mid afternoon at night and at sunrise and each time it was very busy. The Conciege and in room dining services were both great. Mark, at the conciege desk was cortious and very helpful and the in roomig dining staff were remarkable. Although it is a massive hotel my own experience was one where I felt looked after, not just treated as a number. Would stay again",5,
"Firstly, I would like to rave about the Excellent Customer Service provided by the Front Office Department staff, whom had totally made our stay at MBS unforgetable. Staff was polite and sensitive to our needs without us having to prompt. This was displayed when staff arranged for a room with garden view and the birthday cake & wine surprise for my boyfriend. There was even a birthday note for my boyfriend! This is truly an extra mile and effort put in, making sure that the Premier Team left an impactful impression on all customers, especially us. *thumbs up!  Secondly, the Skypark and Infinity Pool is a must-go if you are intending to stay here. The SkyPark overlooks at the Gardens by The Bay and also, the city whilst the Infinity Pool awes you with the excitement and…",5,
"My wife and I have lazed around many good pools in this region, but this pool is tops. That, together with the great buffet breakfast are the two main reasons to spend a night or two at MBS.   As a hotel, it's probably too big and impersonal.   On our last three trips to Singapore, we have stayed at a hotel in Clarke Key, and then spent the last two nights at MBS with 6pm late check-out (at a cost) before our overnight back to Melbourne.   Another plus - the pool has a small section 'no children allowed'  If we go back to Singapore, then MBS will be on our list. ",4,
"Stayed 1-night at CityView Room - gorgeous night view! However, the check-in and check-out are not efficient. I wasn't sure if it's about the duty shift timing, because there are about 7 counters, but only 4 are available.  In general, this hotel is good for a short-term stay due to the overall value. You'll be easily satisfied by the hashtag - wow, I'm in MBS swimming pool! I'm only 40% recommending this place as hotel to live, despite there are other landmarks nearby.",4,
"This bay area is very nicely designed, and is a Nice way to see Singapore skyline from the opposite side from a different perspective.  Lovely views at night for sure... so be there by evening you can view them both under sun and moon!",4,
"So you're going to Singapore and considering the Marina Bay but you're not sure that you want to spend the money.... You don't have the option. Forget it. Fork out the money and spend a few nights there because you will kick yourself later if you don't.  I wouldn't say the hotel is spectacular but the infinity pool is iconic and the only way to enjoy it is to stay there.  Our family of 7 got 2 club level rooms facing the Gardens; #1991 (smoking room) and #2219. The rooms were large, the bathrooms were beautiful and the view was superb. People will say that the city view is better, yes true but at night. You can see the city while you're in the pool area and on the observation deck. Getting a garden view room will let you see the Gardens' light show at night which is lovely.  …",4,
"It is over priced. You get other first star hotels for half the price. But it is worth while for one night. Just to access the infinity pool. In fact if you ask most of the guest there, they are just staying for one day. For with people, or it can totally turn out boring. Just swimming in the pool solo, might make you feel like you wasted a lot of money. It was in my bucket list - yes worthwhile for one night. $600!! But their restaurants are good. The cafe and macaroons. Still expensive. The shopping centre is AMAZING! All designer brands but if you travel with savings then YAY! Very close to the station, if fact you don't even need to walk outdoor from Bayfront station (bay front I think make sure u don't get out in marina bay station like I did, it is very far from there) and…",4,
amazing hotel and view from the sightseeing platform on top of the hotel. Infinity pool looked amazing . Good view of the Grand Prix circuit . Very busy hotel,4,
Good place to visit with family or friends. I reccoment Madina Sands Hotel to go on top and see all singapore from up. As well as the fountain show at 20:00 in the evening.,5,
"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for four nights. Rooms are excellent with nice views of the bay, Marina, old and new Singapore. The Infinity pool spans across the three 56 story towers and offers an unique experience. Adjoining the resort is a huge indoor mall, a casino and a convention.Multiple dining options in the hotel, mall and nearby",5,
"Not much to say on this hotel. I believe guests stay here for the infinity pool. You can see the skyline of Singapore there. The bed is very comfortable and service is good (standard 5 stars hotel service). The hotel breakfast buffet is good too. Basically you get the service you paid for. Hotel guests do get discount for some merchandise shops (not sure if all) at MBS.  If you do have extra to spend, I would recommend this hotel for the view and sleep comfort.",4,
"This is  cheesy hotel - if you like American style massive hotels that literally have tour groups walking thru the Lobby, as in 50 people behind the clown with the flag at the front of the group..... It is so huge it takes ages to get from your room down the towers to reception.  However make sure you do have a drink on the roof top bar which is fantastic and if you are a hotel guest the pool is nothing short of spectacula, very much one of a kind and one of the most eye popping infinity pools ever built .... Epic engineering !!! Breakfast at roof top is sensational.",3,
I stay at many great hotels and the Marina Bay is certainly one of them . It would be hard to fault anything there but the staff there are particularly good. Its like they have started work for the first day the enthusiasm to look after the customers is so genuine. I booked in and the lovely Thersa could not be nicer or more efficient. It was a breath of fresh air after a long international flight.On check out Veronica could not be of more assistance and sorted a minor problem with the bill with great poise and friendliness. Who eer does the staff training should be congratulated many people complain but not enough compliments are given for great service.,5,
Hotel is huge.   Not very personable.   Service was OK at best.   Food was only ok.   Connected to mall with many restaurants and food court.  Casino was ok.   Views of construction was not great.   Nice laser light show at night.  Wouldn't stay again unless for convention. ,3,
"Not much to be said about this place but if you plan to visit Singapore, plan to stay at this hotel, it's worth the extra money only if it means having access to one of the most amazing pools in the world. Everything is nearby: shopping, restaurants, nightclubs, golf, casino...",5,
Extraordinary sky gardens and roof pool - must see. Huge hotel  - 2500 rooms - so all very busy. Expensive food and drink. Other reviews have complained about check in - I think tower 3 is the 'deal' tower and always crammed. Try to get into tower 1 or 2!  Good local food at the back of the mall in the food court. Easy access downtown on the subway. Everything clean and tidy and safe   Excellent spa and good gym,4,
"My stay at MBS was amazing, definitely worth a stay so that you can enjoy swimming in the worlds tallest infinity pool! The views are sensational from up there. We stayed on my friends birthday and the hotel provided a small cake which was delicious! The bell boys, staff and concierge are all extremely helpful. Location is ideal if you want to be quite central, the gardens by the bay is a short walk from the hotel.   The rooms were quite average, nothing truly spectacular. Best part of the room was probably the view, even the garden view is lovely! Plenty of restaurants available inside, we had breakfast on level 57, there was plenty of choice available.  Overall, my trip to singapore would not have been the same without my sunrise/sunset swims in the swimming pool overlooking…",4,
"The pool is worth all the money. I got to hang out by the pool for a full day. It is incredible, the water is not necessarily warm if it is the rainy season, but the view and just being able to swim on top of the world is one of a kind. The room my friend stayed in had a view towards the Gardens by the bay and I could watch the delighting music and color show! Staff is very friendly, the place is very clean. I would recommend it for sure.",5,
"First of all lemme clear this ,my review is only helpful for those who like to stay in serene and calm ,lush green locations like sentosa island for their vacation ....because I love the resort atmosphere where liveliness is there . After spending three nights in Rasa sentosa resort and spa and feeling so Gud about it ,I came to this hotel thinking it to b best property in Singapore ....but sorry guys m completely disappointed as it's hotel it's a commercial tower boasting of its elite branded showrooms...there's no play area where kids can go and enjoy their games ,even the kids pool is boring ....After seeing how Rasa sentosa has managed to bring happiness on kid's faces ,my kids really felt disappointed here .And too at such a high cost😞.It's more or less feels like staying…",1,
"Staying here is quite expensive but who cares.....everything are excellent from the room, foods, staff service and the gorgeous and ginormous infinity pool with the breathtaking view of downtown singapore. Every bit of the money you spent are worth it....",5,
"We've stayed here on a few occasions and each occasion has been different in terms of service. The rooms itself are very spacious and are well laid out. If possible, select the rooms with the city view, you get to wake up and ending the night with views of the beautiful Singapore skyline! Also, it might be worth getting the club rooms as well as you get added bonuses in the Club Lounge.   The pool itself is really nice however very overcrowded most of the time. When we first stayed there, we weren't required to bring a room card for each guest however the last time we were there, this was required which can sometimes be a bit of a hassle.   The breakfast buffet is lovely and you get a good range of foods to choose from.   The service isn't great in comparison to other hotels…",4,
very impressive hotel with good infrastructure. nice pool with beautiful view. expensive drinks on the top. rooms are beautiful. we got an upgrade. very good connections and many things to discover at the shopping mall nearby.,5,
Stayed for two nights at end April 2016.  I had booked city view - not available but was given suite on 54th floor so happy to look out over gardens and boats.  Gorgeous bathroom. nice toiletries.  Check in was quick.  staff all nice and helpful.  Pool was amazing. Unfortunately I was not able to swim - medical reasons - and could not sit by the pool as it was too hot and sunny and no shelter from sun.  Pool was not too crowded.  Wifi was free and okay for me.  No problem connecting.   Breakfast expensive $40 each - only had once - was very nice and all you could eat.  Cake shop on ground floor lovely.   Area expensive all round.  I would stay again on stopover - we were going to Europe - but not for more as too expensive.,4,
"Three stars only may seem a bit harsh for such a stunning building, however below are the reasons.  1. It is not a five star site. It is not on the water as that spot was assigned to the shopping centre across the road. 2 It is an isolated site. The only adjacent infrastructure is the shopping centre which is a little like staying in a hotel next to a Westfield shopping centre , but nothing else in easy walking distance (particularly in Singapore  Heat) 3 check in is a joke. Constant question all day long. We waited in a Que for around twenty minutes then took a further 40 minutes for the receptionist to check us in. When I queried what the problem was she said they were having problems with many guests not yet checkout out. It was now around 5pm in a hotel with over 2000 rooms…",3,
"From entering the hotel customer service is number 1. I was impressed with all the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel I can recommend this Hotel for all. It was so easy to get transport from here to every part of Singapore, from the zoo in the north to universal studios in the south west and airport in the east. We will certainly be back at some point. Fantastic",5,
"The whole hotel experience is amazing. The pool is best pool you'll ever get. Rooms are great, but I was expecting more. Prices are too expensive, in my opinion, and I think that guests should at least get a breakfast by this price. Good for a one night stay and for Facebook pictures.",4,
Awesome service and hefty honeymoon room upgrade.   Had access to the club lounge - felt pretty plush! Cracking view too.  Overall very happy! Big scale hotel but plenty of service.   I dno how much I paid for the room so can't talk about value for money,5,
One of the best hotels in Singapore. Should be a must visit place to all who visit Singapore. A Swim on the 57th floor infinity pool is a bliss.. Its 150 m long and is one of the longest/highest in the world. Pool is accessable only to hotel guest.,5,
"wow this was amazing and the views from the top was wonderful. Just be aware that prices in the bar and restaurant are very expensive. The marina hotel is also amazing and the staff around are very helpful and friendly, meet a great guy working there who was originally from Yorkshire and saw we were not sure where to go and went out of his way to help us.",5,
"Elegant,.. Complete facilities and amenities, stunning view of singapore. Quite expensive as expected in singapore!!! Infinity pool at level 57 is abit overcrowded during our visit but i could say it is well maintained. Recommend for those celebrating special occasions and can spend more:)  ",4,
"We loved our stay at Marina Bay Sands, we treated our Nan (her 80th) and stayed a night whilst traveling and visiting Singapore. Although it's pricey we enjoyed breakfast in bed and loved the view from the infinity pool...it's centrally located and a beautiful place to stay I highly recommend it if you are looking for luxury and splashing out.",4,
"Amazing Hotel to end our honeymoon! The entry into this hotel was phenomenal, huge lobby, beautiful sculptures, gigantic vases to the breathtaking infinity pool and its panoramic views. The staff were super friendly, concierges incredibly helpful, gave us maps, spent time recommending where to visit - including enjoying local food which was great. We journeyed out to the zoo which was highly recommended and didn't disappoint! Popped straight over to the night safari which was an unforgettable experience...Fab zoo Singapore...a lot of fond memories here!",5,
"Have stayed at the Marina Bay Sands twice.  Both times in the same suite on level 54.  Brilliant, unsurpassed views.  From our room we could see Indonesia, Malaysia and of course Singapore.  Being in a suite we had the gold pass access to the infinity pool in the sky which is something that everyone should do once in their lives, and to The Club, and breakfast in the the othe restaurant on level 57.  Overall the service and accommodation was excellent, the location great, and of course the pool was amazing.",5,
"I think it is only one place why you should visit Singapore. I never have been swimming in infinity pool at such height! The rest is the same as in each descent hotel. Expensive breakfast but the richest variety I have ever seen. Basically you do not need to go outside, you have all connections such as bars, restaurants, shops under the roof. I would go back.",5,
Though I wasn't able to explore Marina Bay's interior. The exterior of Marina Bay was breathtaking enough. Took enough pictures on the dock across to fill my Trip Album. Next time will definitely have to stay in the hotel and go for a swim.,5,
Undoubtedly the best hotel of Singapore and one of the best hotels in the world . The Infinity Pool is one of its kind . A combination of perfect architecture and service . And not to forget the casino by the Sands group . Get the best view of Singapore city at one end and the sea at the other,5,
"I don't get why it's so expensive. I mean I get it the infinity pool is a big deal. But other than the magnificent view, the rooms are pretty average.   I thoroughly enjoyed the in room breakfast I ordered but the kitchen is not Muslim friendly. There are vegetarian dishes but the kitchen serves pork so Muslim might want to visit 'Beanstro' in 'shoppes', the only halal food in the area.   Also, since there are so many floors, be prepared to stop at almost every other floor as you make your way down to the lobby. I don't know if I'm impatient or it's just really annoying to have to wait for the door to close at every other floor becaus the elevator is already full.",3,
"Pros : Infinity Pool, Spacious Rooms & Bathrooms, Uninterrupted views of the City and Gardens by the Bay, Massive Shopping Centre, Train Station below that is well connected. Cons : Cocktails by the pool were very disappointing, and can get extremely crowded by the pool during certain times of the day.",5,
"Booked in February and requested for a higher level room. Arrived in May and after long time waiting at the front desk no dedicated room was appointed reserved yet. Got a room at the 5th Floor only. Supervisor was called and did not even bother to talk to me just to the girl behind the desk, no efforts to listen to me. A higher level room city view at extra payment was offered which I principally refused. We stayed 3 nights but regretted we did not only stay one night. Traffic Noise at 5th Floor was really disturbing at night. Swimming Pool and view from Top Floor was marvellous.",2,
"We stayed here for the pool and view and we loved spending time at the pool. However the rest of the hotel is very busy, impersonal and expensive. The value for money at the restaurants was poor ($22 for a beer at the rooftop bar). The buffet selection is fine - sky57 is a quieter option for breakfast with nice options.",3,
Don't forget to go Marina bay sands even if you play casino or not. just visit there with your original passport (If singaporean they charge 100$ for entry..but visitors get free entry) and,3,
Second time we have stayed here and never again.  It's way too big and over priced.  Great place to visit but much nicer places to stay nearby. The pool is too small for the hotel and on 3 occasions we were unable to get beds by pool. It's chaos up there. The whole hotel feels like a city and there is NO personal service. You wouldn't know who hotel guests are and who are just visiting for the day. So disappointed as its so expensive.  I would expect to get a bed by the pool. It's way too crowded on the top. Hasn't been thought through !,3,
"This is the best hotel in Singapore. One should select room with city view. Facilities are great. Swimming pool at floor 57 is simply amazing & is a major attraction for tourist. One should stay here for at least 2 days to enjoy & see various facilities offered by the hotel as well as to see nearby attractions. This hotel is excellent in terms of service, ambience, food quality.",4,
"Paid something like $30 to take an elevator to the top of Marina Bay Sands. We even had to pay for our 2 year old, which I think was ridiculous. It is literally just a deck, albiet with a good view of Singapore. I do not think it was worth the amount and thought it was quite cheeky to charge children only two years old.",1,
"We stayed here 3 nights. The view from the infinity pool on 57th floor was awesome nights and days. I borrowed a wheelchair during my stay, which helped me move to a casino and shopping mall in the area. ",5,
"Pros: - Amazing view - Cool roof-top pool and bar - Adjascent to luxury brand mall, MRT bayfront station - So many touristy attractions around (gardens by the bay, singapore flyer, water full light, etc) - Celebrity chef restaurants - Casino  Cons: - So so room facilities (tv, wifi, bathroom fixture). You expected more high-end room facilities in this one of the best building in the world. It's disappointing that once you enter the room, you dont get the same wow effect as you get when you enter the lobby and roof top pool - Checking-in took us forever. Queueing was fast but the front desk staff needed more than 30minutes to get us available room, and another hour to get the room ready for us (we arrived at 1pm). They texted us when the room ready. ",3,
 A staycation during the weekend with family. The view from the 46th floor is really excellent.  Never missed the swimming pool on the 57th floor. There is a renovation probably upgrading the restaurant. The pool is really crowded as it is the main attraction of the hotel. The view from the pool overlooking Singapore is marvelous.   The buffet spread at Rise restaurant is excellent and worth the price.  We booked the Orchid Suite everything was really to the standard of Sands except the bed was a queen instead of a King.   Overall is still an excellent stay and great staff smile everywhere.,5,
"My one night stay not only met, but exceeded the high expectations set for this hotel.  Booking was for a club room, which was unexpectedly upgraded to a suite on arrival.  Located on the 48th floor on the corner of tower 3, it provided both city and garden views.   The facilities and staff in ""The Club"" were excellent.  Highly recommend spending the extra money for the use of this facility.  The chocolate and cheese offering in the late evening is also worthwhile (extra cost)...maybe skip dinner and go straight to dessert! The infinity pool was amazing, although the atmosphere is lacking at times with 99% of people in the pool with their selfie sticks! After a heavy downpour in the late morning I quickly returned to the pool and was the only one there for about 20 minutes -…",5,
"We stayed here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon and after reading some of the reviews before we checked in we were little worried as people had said they had waited ages to check in.  We arrived at 5pm on Thursday and thought it was going to be busy but we only waited 5 mins to check in and the check in staff were excellent they also mentioned they were running on 100% occupancy too but you couldn't tell, they had noted we were on our honeymoon and upgraded our room to a premier city view which had a separate bath and when we got to the room we had a rose petal bath and the obligatory towel swans at the bottom of the bed 😊 it was a really lovely touch!  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful we are in a few of the restaurants the Rise buffet was excellent great…",4,
"Love this hotel, second favourite in the world. If you stay then make time for the rooftop infinity pool, just amazing. Would stay here every time. Great restaurants and superb staff. Amazing hotel in an amazing city.",5,
"With excellent customer service and the best food I ever had, the best view, ambiance and set up and the  people I love...it's the perfect place for the moment. I highly recommend this place. Excellent is an understatement. ",5,
"Been twice now. Had to come to this place after watching the documentary on how it was built. The best is the club membership. Breakfast daily + afternoon tea + cocktails and canape (enough to fill you up for dinner) The food is top quality, very international and fresh. I got to taste some cheese that you just can't get in Australia that I had not had since my trip to france. French champagne and XO cognac all included in the club membership. Very worth the money and of course the POOOOOOOOL.",5,
"Hotel is stunning, we got a room with an amazing view so overall we were happy with stay. I wish we had wandered outside the resort for food, everything inside is so expensive. Also be careful when booking your rooms, some rates are non-changeable, non-refundable which is stated in very tiny print. Only saw 1 concierge for such a huge place, and MBS didn't do a good job explaining about what was included in our 15% attraction discount so we never used it .",5,
"This is hotel is everything you expect & pay for.  Rooms are amazing, huge and have all the trimmings.  View is spectacular, be prepared to pay for food and beverages approx $24SGD for a cocktail.    My recommendation is to stay here once to experience the hype, you cannot visit the pool unless you are staying at the hotel - that is worth the price tag!    Try and get a room on the floors 54 - 59, you have your own lifts and you don't have to stop 100 times to get up / down.  My personal preference is the city view, however both are exceptional.  Try East Coast Lagoon - for great local street food, or the hawker centre in the ball is well priced.",5,
"One of the most beautiful hotel I have ever seen. Three beautiful towers in front of the Singapore marina that has everything you need. A excellent service, gym, breakfast, and very confortable beds and pillows that made me sleep like a baby. I can not forget to mention the famous and amazing sky pool infinity with stunning views of the Sungapure skyline. If you are looking to shop, the Marina Bay Sands has a variety of shops inside the hotel. Also, the hotel connects to an amazing shopping mall. If you are looking to party or have drinks and meet interesting people, you can not miss to go to the skybar right next to the infinity pool. Guest of the hotel do not have to pay any fees to get at the club and no waiting line.",5,
"This was my second stay at Marina Bay Sands this year. The hotel is absolutely incredible. Recommend: Upgrading to a Club Room with a city view. Drinks and buffet breakfast included.  LEVEL 57. Hands down one of the most incredible pools in the world, but that's pretty known. Suggest: Waking up early enough to visit the hot spas parallel to the pool facing the sunrise. So relaxing!  Staff. Super professional, efficient, nothing is too much trouble.  Be sure to give yourself a whole 24hrs to enjoy just the hotel. You'll need it.  Note: La Pau Sat (SATAY HEAVEN) short drive from the hotel. Affordable, great atmosphere, incredible food, all hours!",5,
"It's always such a great relief to know that the hotel you booked lives up to the reviews given.  This one will tick all the boxes for even the most sceptical.  Excellent service that always comes with a free smile.  With so much to offer at the Marina,  you really don't need to go anywhere else",5,
We stayed in the hotel for one night mainly in order to use the pool on the roof. The service was very nice and also the room. We got a room facing the highway and at night you can hear the cars although the windows are closed. Another disappointment was the the garden on the roof was under renovation and was closed although no one mentioned it during the booking. At the end of the day you pay for the right to say that you stayed in this hotel.,4,
"We spent a few nights at MBS in May 2015 and it was an excellent experience. The hotel truly has it all, and offers surprisingly good service for such a large property. The pool is clearly a must, especially as the sun is setting on the city.   Being a Singapore icon, be prepared to pay a premium for pretty much anything - there is no cheap way to stay at MBS :) It's worth every penny though.  Tip - whilst everyone thinks the city side view is better (and more expensive), the garden side view is in my opinion the better option (you can always see the city side from the pool), and unlike the city side, has balconies and opening windows (a big plus).",5,
"The service here is second to none. I had the most beautiful flower arrangement waiting for me, and the room was huge (I think it was the Orchid Suite). Couldn't have asked for a more perfect Valentines Day getaway. Absolutely love staying here! (not just for the pool).",5,
"In terms of location to other parts of Singapore like Duxton Place, Fort Canning, the forest reserves etc.. its a bit out of the way. The hotel design with its massive atrium is remarkable but I'd rather spend my time out looking at the eternal blue sky. There is a very large and good food court in the basement area. The main point of course of staying at the Marina Bay Hotel is to lounge and people watch in its boat like swimming pool perched rather precariously on top of the hotel. There you will see all the beautiful people you want. And the view is magnificent. Try and of course not stay during the monsoon season otherwise you'll be stuck in your hotel room. If you don't like swimming pools or casinos - stay elsewhere.",5,
The most arrogant service I ever seen. Don't stay there just take a picture from outside is good enough. There are better hotel with better package in Singapore. Look in Tripadvisor ranking in that city and you will see. But don't make that mistake!!!!,1,
"No tourist allowed at the infinity pool so we stayed for 3 nights and lived the high life.  The pool was simply amazing, never seen so many self sticks in one spot, lol.   The pool temperature was beautiful, could have stayed in the pool for hours.  Obviously a major tourist attraction and the pool packs in a lot of people as such many of the sun beds in the prime spots are taken.   Unfortunately there are inconsiderate people that leave the pool and leave their towels on the sun beds so many people walk past thinking they are occupied but they are not.   Our room had the garden view and from the 49th floor, the view was amazing and at night, Gardens by the bay lit up so that was a bonus.  The Singapore Flyer is near by but there was no point hopping on as our views from the…",4,
"It's extremely difficult to describe all that I experienced here.   We originally had two nights, but when we arrived from Tokyo we were too tired to find another place to stay and decided we might as well splurge a little and pay an extra night.   Alas, we arrived one night before our reservation and managed to get a room at the 2nd floor with garden view. I highly discourage anyone to do this. A better room isn't that much more expensive. And it's not worth it to stay here if you don't have at least a good view.   Staff was extremely friendly and polite.   The second day we switched to our actual room. Floor 42, city view. The view is breathtaking. The room itself is ok, although it's carpeted, the amazing bathroom makes up for it.  Room reeked of cigarette but staff did their…",5,
"do we really need to write a review for MBS? the service, food, ambience, infinity pool, all of it is in a charged electric atmosphere. if u can, just go for it. they pamper you well enough to keep you coming back for more!",5,
If there is a place to go in Singapore it would be the MBS Skypark for the view.  Unless you stay in the hotel most of the Skypark is off limits.  But there is a special section where visitors can go to eat or have a drink on the 56th floor.  If costs S$20 to go up.  Unless you want to spent the night at $450 this is the next best alternative.  The view are stunning.,4,
"This hotel is like an amusement park.  I enjoyed pool, spa and restaurant very much but it is a bit expensive.  I recommend to stay here one night if you come to Singapore.",4,
"We stayed in a spacious room, with great view on the gardens by the bay. Double bed, nice tv, bath tub in front of a window so also great view from the bathroom. Very spacious shower as well. Free access to rooftop infinity pool when you stay in the hotel (you get a wrist band when you enter the pool in the morning, which gives you access to the pool and free towel hire the entire day). We were there in February 2015 and the pool was pretty busy, even though it wasn't high season.",4,
"This is a good complex to spent time within. There are mall, water attraction, and the famous casino itself",4,
"The hotel is so big, so noisy and so busy. We found a good staff at the check in counter, a Mr Shri Ram, a fellow Malaysian, who got us our room super fast. So blissful after the chaotic crowd at the check in counters. Our room on the 40th floor came with a marvellous view of the ocean front. You can see the floating stadium, Louis Vuitton by the bay and a view of the city. The Gardens by the Bay is right next door, walking from the hotel is a breeze. Taxis are readily available.  I find the staff here from the housekeeping to the valet, efficient and helpful. Only that the hotel is much too big for my liking. The infinity pool on the 57 floor is equally big and overcrowded. Guests were more interested to take pictures than to swim. Maybe if it was less crowded I would have…",4,
"We moved here for fun after a wonderful stay at the Fullerton Hotel, just across the bay. The contrast, as we expected, was huge! Our room was high up the 57 storied tower, and there are three towers joined by an unbelievable pool at the top, shaped like a boat perched upon the three towers. We had a Club room and the upgrade was worth it as the room was large with a superb view. The hotel is large but very clean and has excellent management. Our personal Concierge was Jasmine and she really always put herself out. A clever feature as otherwise a hotel of this size could be impersonal. Club benefits, at the top, included a special area, uncrowded for breakfast, and with small free buffet that changed three times a day. Huge shopping malls complete the experience. Full marks to…",5,
"Great views for the top deck, go to Ku de ta bar for a drink or just visit the observation deck. Also the restaurant is open to visitors, very nice to have a drink there and enjoy the skyline at night. Definitely worth the visit! Service at the restaurant was beyond excellent!!",5,
Our room on Tower Two at the 20th floor is overlooking Gardens by the Bay. What a beautiful and refreshing view when you wake up and before you sleep! I couldn't ask for more! My husband and I were so happy to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary here! Buffet breakfast at Rise restaurant was also the best. Staff are warm and effecient despite many guests. And the view at the infinity pool is simply wonderfull! Truly a place worth celebrating a milestone in!,5,
"The room was clean, nicely done up and room service pretty quick!   Infinity pool was amazing but my only gripe is the coldness of the water at night. I had this impression it was a heated pool. We'll definitely return to stay here!",4,
"Stayed here with family iconic architecture looked really great from out side got a room in the Awing on 24 floor nice view of the the gardens by the bay from my window . Looked beautiful at night . The infinity pool was absolutely mind blowing , kids had gr8 time there . Ku deta played NYC music good crowd overall experience was nice . The Botique s in the hotel offered good shopping . Huge casino ...",4,
"It's very well organized and well maintained 5 star hotel. The room is clean, well equipped, comfortable with fluffy bed. We liked the TWG tea provided in room and the speedy room service. Extra bed was provided within 10mins and without additional charges(subject to availability). The valet car park is convenient and reasonably priced at SGD12 per day with multiple entries. Swimming pool at level 57 gives great view, we liked it especially during night time(closed at 11pm), though a bit crowded. The hotel is located near to Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyers and Suntech city. ",4,
"We stayed a night at the MBS only for two reasons: to use the amazing swimming pool on the 57th floor n to take lots of pictures of the city view from our room. View is stunning and the swimming pool is out of this world. Otherwise the service is only so so cos the hotel is just too huge with 3 big towers. Attention to guests is at best effective but not personalized. Hotel breakfast wasn't anything to shout about either. I would recommend staying here only for the pool. If not, the price tag is just too high.",3,
"We stayed here for one night, and I am so glad we did, it was just stunning! We got a complimentary upgrade to a room overlooking the gardens, and it was beautiful. We also got a late checkout so we could enjoy the pool the next morning. Everyone at the hotel was so nice, and the service was amazing! Be prepared to see a lot of people taking tons of selfies though, we even saw a family changing into another set of clothes....",5,
"This is what i do when i'm not backpacking - Livin' it up like a boss at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Once in a while, it's definitely nice to indulge yourself in a bit of luxury. The room is huge and the bed is super comfortable, with a great view of the garden and the sea. Because the property also has a mall, shopping will never be a problem. The infinity pool at the roof top is really the icing in the cake. There's no better way to view the city than from up there. Everything you could ever ask for in a 5-star hotel is at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Truly, one of the most beautiful hotels you will ever see in the whole of Asia. I would love to come back, and stay there again.   http://www.pinoyboyjournals.com",5,
"Staying in this iconic hotel was on my list in Singapore since first seeing the unique buildings from the taxi from the airport. Once checked in and settled I proceeded to the roof top infinity pool.... WOW. Spend a Friday or Saturday night by the pool sipping cocktails and people watching and you will leave happy. The rooms in the hotel (i was in tower 3) are better than standard and I had a balcony overlooking Gardens by the Bay. There is a plethera of options for dining but I reccomend the Buffet for value for money, especially when they are offering seafood nights.",5,
"So happy we stayed here!! This place is eye opening and the rooftop pool has to be seen to be believed and enjoyed. Room was really large and the whole place really clean. Plenty of staff to assist you with all your needs. Breakfast was out of this world!! So much to choose from, they really cater for all tastes and much more. The views are spectacular whichever side you look from, out to sea where there are boast as far as the eye can see, or the city side over the marina you can just sit for hours drinking Singapore slings and take it all in, you seriously don't have to leave the place, there is that much to do. Highly recommend",5,
"Absolutely loved it, we were in tower 1 ,41st floor ,gorgeous view, gorgeous food, pool closed too early is my only dislike ,11pm, room was superb. Is close to shopping, restaurants, just a very nice part of Singapore, I will stay there again when I go back. ",4,
The tourists are allowed only to the side deck. Nothing to see. In my opinion a waste of time and money.,2,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands in May 2015 on our way home from the Maldives honeymoon.  We had a city view room and the room was very large with beautiful views of Singapore. The pool was definitely a ""must see"" albeit very crowded during the day.  The included buffet breakfast was one of the largest and most comprehensive I have ever seen and food quality was excellent.  I found service to be OK but check-in and check-out lines were ridiculously long. We spent 45 minutes waiting in line to check in at 10pm at night.  Location was good and only a short walk to the centre of town, hawker centres etc.",3,
"I think this is the best experience so far. i get to experience the world's most amazing hotel rooftop pool. The view is just so amazing. The room i stayed is very comfortable and clean, the staff are friendly too.",5,
"This stay was a special treat for my wife's birthday. From the very start the staff were excellent.  It is very unusual that everything goes perfectly, but this was the exception. The Orchid Suite was excellent with a great view of the Gardens by the Bay. The Club is well worth it good food, service and a pleasant environment with a spectacular view. A little expensive but as this was a special trip and you get what you pay for. This was a treat and we felt pampered for the entire 7 days we stayed. This is a large facility but once you work out how to get around it is quite user friendly. The staff were great they call you by your name and they meet your every need. Fantastic place to stay.",5,
first of all i couldnt stay at the hotel so this is not a hotel review. However i visited the top observation deck (57th floor) & it was truly amazing. it was 360 observation deck to see through Singa at one glance. Best to visit at the night.,5,
"Staff was wonderful and upgraded us for free to a business executive suite!  spent most of our time on the roof in the pool!  Highly recommend being up there for sunrise!  spend some time in the mall, casino, check out the light show!",5,
"I dont know what the 5 stars hotel stand for? Service is poor if not to say worst. The quality of finishing in the room and bathroom are questionable.  ""Be aware that if you want to access to the pool, gym or top floor deck, you need to carry your own individual key. (by example, we did not get inform about this policy, we where in tower 1, 40th floor, we went to tower 3, 57th floor (18 min door to door walk + up and down elevator ride + check in, to end up being turn back, because we had only one key on us) "", great experience of 650 US$/ night.  At the end you pay for the stunning view, but nothing more. All depends your standards, really did not pass the test for us.",1,
"This was the nicest place we have stayed however that was to be expected for the price.  We had city view rooms on floor 38, we travelled with friends so had four rooms.  Checkin was a nightmare as they had no rooms for us so after an hour in foyer we got two rooms with the others avail two hours later and not what we booked.  We didn't get into those rooms till after 6pm so they need to fix this.  The bars on top don't cater for travellers as men had to wear long pants and as we were going onto Thailand and it was very hot we had none so could not get into there.  It was worth it to swim in the beautiful pool and to say we had gone there.  Breakfast was great however very busy and crowded, you had to line up for food.",4,
MBS in 5 sentences  Big spacious rooms!  Fantastic restaurants albeit pricey.   Infinity pool with a view to die for.  World class performances at the marina bay sands theatre.  Interesting exhibits at the Artscience museum!,5,
"This hotel offers you a pool experience quite out of this world. Yes, it is worth it. Rooms are comfortable and clean, as one would expect from a big, pricey hotel. Some will also have a nice view of the city. Service was smooth, but check-in and check-out queues may be somewhat annoying (express check-out machines did not work during our stay, unfortunatelly). Overall, an overpriced hotel with a wonderful pool. You should try it at least once in your lifetime.",4,
"This hotel is simply amazing !!! I had seen the pictures of it on the internet, but nothing prepares you for it. Everything is HUGE !! But my favourite part, is the 150 metre infinity pool which is right up the top on the 57th floor. It is incredible. It is only for use by hotel guests and was just amazing.It's open from 6am-11pm every day and the views are stunning. Make the most of it !!",5,
"Brilliant hotel to stay at, big rooms, great views from the room also!  The pool and view from the roof was breathtaking!,  very busy, but great.  The casino was quite smokey unfortunatly.  Seems to be the only place smoking is allowed.   The shopping area was huge,  you go underground and it links to the building across the road that houses the theatre, convention centre, more shops and eateries.  Would recommend to all and i would stay again.",5,
"It was a real pleasure living in this Iconic hotel, which is now a ""symbol"" of Singapore now. The Luxury speaks itself. However the city view is only on one side, the other side only has sea and Gardens by the bay view, so prefer to get the one on Singapore City Side.  The Staff pampers you, and they are super friendly. You'll be taken care of right from the Taxi Drop off.   The Skypool is great and an experience in itself. Both day and night views are stunning and its fun swimming so high in the sky!",5,
"I'm a local and lead a busy lifestyle, staycations are my favorite thing to do on weekends to unwind. Also, since it was my bf's birthday, I decided that I had to pick a more indulgent weekend accommodation so, Marina Bay Sands Hotel was it and specifically the club room! Upon arrival, the place was really crowded with tourists. I suppose from a business POV, yes it's good but as a guest, it didn't give me a warm and personal vibe. Also, I didn't feel that I was entering a 5 star hotel, it felt more like a convention hotel.   The Club Room was nice and spacious. We were welcomed with a bowl of fruits and nice chocolates. The bath and wash area was superbly spacious, and luxurious, with a separate shower, tub, toilet and a his/hers sink. This was definitely up my alley! The room…",2,
"Lovely stay, friendly staff and beautiful surrounds. The pool is fantastic. And so are the views. The room was great big and spacious and open door to a small balcony.  We paid extra for acces to the Club and enjoyed the many delicacies on offer to eat for afternoon tea!!! The view having breakfast was amazing and the staff were so friendly and attentive. My husband and I truely enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone to stay a few nights here! ",5,
This is must visit place if you are in Singapore. Skydeck is amazing. View from top is breathtaking.  If you just wanna go on top and not for dining and not even sraying there then also you can go by paying some charge.  There is good section of drink options at top and it feels you are on top of world there.,5,
Photos simply don't do this place justice. Superb & a must have visit for a rooftop drink with that special someone. Go after 8pm for light show across bay as well.,4,
"Great hotel with wonderful experience of stay, relaxation and all the amenities a traveler would ask for. For a price which is a little bit more than the usual it does pinch a little bit but once you are in the hotel the hotel takes care of you very well. Great food, wonderful location and scenic views. Try to get room with city view to enjoy a wonderful view.",5,
"As many previous reviews will attest to, the main reason to stay here is for the pool. And why not!    The hotel is large, so large that it feels impersonal; however, if you want an intimate experience, look elsewhere. I had minimal staff interaction so cannot comment on the standard of service. I stayed in a Club Room; the room and amenities were clean, well-furnished and spacious.  The bathroom was also large, complete with a ‘his’ and ‘hers’ sink, and there was a TV located above the bath (always a bonus). Breakfast (if not included in the room rate) is pricey and there appears to be a queue most mornings. Cheaper alternatives are close by in the shopping centre. I also used the gym facilities. A must try if you like to stay fit as it has all the equipment of a regular gym. …",4,
We had nice view from the room and from sky park. The pool on the top is unique. There are many good restaurants and shopping facilities in the building. Liitle bit crowdy and therefore unpersonal. But it is a fantastic place.,5,
"Huge casino, amazing luxury shopping right underneath the hotel, lots of restaurants & cafes within the hotel to choose from, so easy to get around Singapore with a constant flow of taxis waiting right outside! My deluxe king room was so spacious & the view was to die for! Would definitely stay here again!",5,
My friend and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for 2 nights. Check in was very easy and efficient and staff were friendly and helpful. The room was fabulous and the view over the Gardens by the Bay from our balcony was breath-taking. The infinity pool was definitely the highlight. Floating in that pool and taking in the magnificent view of the city was incredible.,5,
"nice service, very clinical though - not a typical Asian haunt. For ""proper"" Asian / Singapore go to a smaller restaurant outside the hotel on one of the Quays",4,
"Whilst being a spectacular hotel with great views from the Pool on the top (cant remember how many floors but it is a lot), Decent Casino and nice rooms, which lets face it is everything one wants form a hotel. If you are trying to immerse yourself into the Singaporean or wider Asian culture this in NOT the hotel to do it in. It cold be anywhere in the world. In fact it smack of a Vegas Hotel Casino, which bearing in mind it is pert of the Sands group isn't surprising. I was there on business so it got the job done, but if I were there on a vacation trying catch the SE Asia experience i would have been a little let down",3,
"i stayed for 5 nights & had a good time. rooftop restaurant, pool are worth visit. missed the opportunity to utilise pool everyday as just got a time to be there on my last day.   The best part is of this property is driving experience on Ferrari 430 & Lambo :). next time for sure stay with family.",5,
"The first experience of staying at this hotel. what can I say what a WOW!  Superior building & premium infinity pool. You can see almost all the scenery of Marina Bay.  Even, this building became the most favourite icons of Singapore, alongside with Art Museum of Singapore. Decorated by Helix Bridge & Boat Quay. Super close to shopping mall The Shoppers at Marina Bay Sands. Near to Singapore Stadium, famous food district ""Makan Sutra"" and also famous hangout place ""Clarke Quay"".",5,
"Loved the Skyline Pool known as Infinity Pool, One can spend whole day or evening there.Shopping Lovers there are many luxurious brands one cannot escape. Loved the ambiance and the amazing laser show there.",5,
One of these landmarks you have to go when in Singapore. Breath taking views from the top The shopping centre at the bottom is also worth the visit,4,
"I'd watched the Marina bay sands being built on several trips to and from Singapore and leapt at the chance to stay at it. The stay was definitely worth the wait.  Staying in tower 3 I was on the 46th floor which gave spectacular views of the Singapore skyline. Complimentary water and free WiFi plus impeccable service made my stay pleasant. The pool on the 57th floor is a must see and breakfast meals were stunning.  Rounding out a great stay there is an excellent food court in the complex as well as the incredible Din Tai Fung restaurant (they specialise in dumplings and several of their outlets have been awarded michellin star ratings).  The only negative was the wait for a room. Arriving at 630 in the morning after 10.5 hours of flying, I was told that the room wouldn't be…",5,
The room( 29th floor) and the pool were the main attraction anf both are amazing. I am sure the skyview from the swimming pool is the most beautiful view I've seen. Ask for room in the rear area with gardens by the bay view. You van enjoy the lightshow from the balcony. ,5,
"Awesomeness personified! Had an amazing experience , stayed just for 2 nights but it was the best stay in Singapore. Must go to Kudetas, Casino and the pool side area . Offers amazing breath taking view of the city . An extremely comfortable stay. ",5,
My second time in this luxurious hotel. The room is spacious and very clean and you'll be given another bed if you booked 3 pax in a room. The garden view room faces Gardens By the Bay which is a great site whether day or night =) Access to Infinity Pool (which is a place not to miss when in this hotel) and Skypark is also free when you book this hotel.  Check in timing improved a lot. During my first visit we waited for more than half an hour just to check in. This time only took us 10mins and they even have a place to sit and wait now. Good job!,4,
"Stayed for one night. The hotel is huge. Don't have enough to explore everything but within walking distance to the shopping malls, casino and the expo. They have good view of the bay. The room is cozy and comfortable. The only thing that I'm not satisfied is their WiFi speed is not as fast as I would expect from such a hotel. I have seen better speeds from a less expensive hotels.",5,
"This is a gotta-see place, a hotel with a big pool on the top. See if a gurst will let you through to walk the length of the pool. And, try to go up at night for a thrilling view of Singapore!!",5,
"This is an amazing hotel.  A huge atrium (larger than the average airport) links three massive towers with an amazing infinity pool at the top.  The rooms are large with amazing views over Singapore, and beautifully appointed. There are dozens of restaurants and the most amazing shopping centre linked to the lobby - think Chanel, Gucci, Rolex through to Gap and Zara and everything in between. It's not personal, very far from boutique, but well worth it for a quick stopover. The service was impeccable for such a large hotel. Loved it for a short stay.... Well worth the effort.",5,
"So perfect...The room is very spacious..With many compliments such as drinking water, fragrant shampoo and soap, large bathroom, and many more...Also, access to the mall with high class restaurant and shopping arcade..Don't forget the rooftop swimming pool..",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is very colourful at night. Different light everywhere, spectacular! Just sit face the building,and your eyes will be attached by the glamour.This is the new Singapore's icon. Towering over the bay,the hotel is luxury with a rooftop infinity pool,and so many dining options.",3,
"we went there for a stay but due to no vaccant room we could not stay there - unfortunate ! but none the less we thought to atleast eat n drink at their deck which is like on the roof top next to the pool. pools not open for the generic public but the bar by its side was open to all .  we had an awesome evening , enjoyed our drinks there watching over Singapore standing talll there was surely an experience . To add on the weather got naughty and it rained too .but it just made the whole view all the more beautiful . its surely the most beautifull construction of modern times andone of the tallest , the over view of singapore creates an  awestuck moment . the casino at its basement is a must must must visit - for its grandeur , class and feel stay is expensive but experience…",5,
"Booked in via travel agent - so did not look at hotel web site.  It a huge hotel with 3 quite separate towers. so lots of up and down and waits. Building work on top of tower 2 and the pool though great on pictures is impractical to exercise or lounge given how crowded and uncomfortable it was. Staff were very nice and the gym excellent. But if you want Las Vegas go there and if you want a top experience there are better hotels - we moved after 3 days to Ritz Carlton - nicer, smaller.",3,
lovely view from the observatory!! wish we could go see the swimming pool! but you must visit once during late evenings! dont miss the the fullerton circle waterboat house near it!!,4,
We had very high expectations of this hotel and these were well and truly met. This hotel is totally amazing. We loved the pool - the views from it are totally amazing. The restaurants we ate in were also amazing - great food and service.  The shopping centre and casino attached to the hotel are also amazing - well worth visiting.  We will be back again!,5,
Spectacular hotel! The view is amazing. It has the most amazing pool. The food is outstanding and the overall service was excellent! It was a little expensive but it was worth the value! Everything is more than I had expected it to be! Loving the view and it's the highlight of my vacation so far!,5,
"The room was great - everything you'd want was available. The bathroom had a shower AND a bath, great for those who don't want to chose! The room was located in tower 2 on the 26th floor and had beautiful views of the sea and the gardens. The highlight was the observation deck and pool on the 57th floor which is free for hotel guests. Breakfast was great too - wonderful selection. Staff was nice and service was as personable as it could get in such a huge place like this one. If you enjoy staying in one place then you have everything you need here albeit at a price. The only annoying thing was having to carry your card with you at all times in the top floor but quite a minor point.",4,
"Fantastic hotel. We booked an executive (or club) suite, had a VIP check in area and was offered afternoon tea daily. Great rooms with views of Singapore. Infinity pool was a bit crowded but good nonetheless. Probably the best hotel in Singapore in my opinion, with high end fashion brands and a casino all within the complex so you don't even need to leave the hotel. I would recommend an upgrade to a suite and definitely stay here again next time I'm in Singapore. ",5,
"Stayed in MBS Hotel during Christmas eve... This was my 3rd time and it was still as frwat as before...  This time I requested a room with Gardens by the Bay view...   The breakfast was really great and my son really enjoyed his time there....  What I dont really understand is why I couldnt use tripod at the top floor? I was about taking pictures at night and the officer said that tripod is not allowed. I am not a professional photographer, I only enjoy taking night scene pictures...  Overall, we did enjoy our stay at MBS...",4,
"This is now Singapore's most iconic hotel, and the best thing about it is the spectacular view from the rooftop infinity pool 57 floors high. It also houses a skypark (ticketed), a restaurant (Sky on 57) and a nightclub (Ku De Ta).  As a Singaporean doing a one-night ""staycation"", first I have to say, if you want to experience Singapore this is not the hotel to do it with. This is a hotel for wealthy folks dropping in for a weekend at the casino and a bag shopping spree at LV. There is very little here that is reflective of Singapore as a culture or country. That said, the service was efficient - businesslike rather than warm, but the sheer numbers of guests makes that understandable. The huge number of guests means that the rooftop pool is also hugely crowded, kudos to the…",4,
We stayed here with our kids for a night simply for the pool and it was well worth it.  The views are spectacular and the staff at the pool was very attentive and nice.  We will definitely come back and stay here again,5,
"The food was outstanding. The bedrooms were really lovely and all of the staff were very welcoming. The views from the infinity pool were out of this world, so beautiful. It was the best hotel I have ever stayed in, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. ",5,
"My husband and I felt that the MBS is an iconic must-see landmark so we decided to splurge on our last night in Singapore. As we had already spent the previous few days exploring the city, we spent our time at MBS relaxing, exploring the Gardens by the Bay and enjoying a fantastic view from the infinity pool for the sunset and again for sunrise.  Though we booked the cheaper room, it was still incredibly spacious with a small balcony, large bathroom and super comfy bed.  Understandably, a hotel of this capacity is not for everyone as it does get crowded in the lobby and the pool though we never failed to find a lounge chair by the pool or a spot by the edge for a breathtaking view of the city. It's true that it's not ""cosy"" or ""personal"" and none of the staff knew our names but…",5,
"The hotel not only looks impressive from the outside, but from within too. It's vast and breathtaking when you walk in to the lobby to check-in. We arrived at about 9am after a long journey and we were checked in without delay and given an upgrade from the room we had originally booked. Without a doubt, the infinity pool is the most impressive aspect of the hotel. It's the wow factor. I would recommend a stay, just for this experience. We didn't eat at the hotel, but all the food looked great. We found a halker centre just ten minutes walk around the marina on Raffles Quay. That is definitively worth a visit if you are staying, or even if you are not. ",5,
"We travelled in April 2014 for one night. We upgraded our deluxe room to the club room which included a bigger room, afternoon tea at the club, cocktails and canapes in the afternoon and full access to the pool area.  We were taken from the foyer into the VIP check in as it was busy and our bags delivered shortly thereafter. The in room concierge explained each feature of the room and how to use everything giving us his mobile phone number if we needed anything at any time. My sons bed was not made up as yet and staff were extremely apologetic providing a proper mattress bed instead of a dodgy rollaway bed. Excellent room service and fast wi-fi   The rooftop pool is selfie heaven with everyone in the pool holding a camera. Very relaxing and amazing views. The staff and security…",5,
Met some friends for drinks who we're staying there. To get a seat we had to spend at least $200 which isn't hard as it's very expensive. A bottle of wine is at least $100. The views are worth the visit but what lets the place down is the service. It was slow and they got the order wrong and we had to send a drink back 3 times! The staff are a bit disinterested which is bad considering you're paying 5* prices for 2* service.,3,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands last May and really enjoyed it.  The hotel complex is very impressive, everything works as it should.    One of the best things the hotel offers is the infinity pool, I think it is one of the most amazing hotel pools in the world due to the design and the views of the city from there, just fantastic.   The staff at the pool specially Carlo are all excellent and really nice.  The buffet breakfast was very good.  In general we loved our stay at this hotel.",5,
"We planned to stay here from the beginning. After such a long time, we managed having a right time to explore this awesome hotel. We picked ""the premium"" type of room. it was a spacious and luxury room, everything was perfect! We love to spend enjoying the room mostly. The staff also friendly to help us at the reception. The infinity swimming pool with the Singapore sky crapper building's view was really extraordinary. Staying at Marina Bay Sands was a delight experience, nothing compares! If we want to try something different it's a worth to stay here... ",5,
"One off the Singapore landmarks with the best vieuw, the best and one off the most spectaculair pools in the world. Not cheap but very nice, only there is very little personal attention in this huge not to cheap hotel for the guest. But a must when you are in Singapore.",5,
This hotel is beyond this world. Wilder than anything else. The roof garden is a cloud looking like the deck of a cruise ship on top of the 3 tall blocks. The infinity pool is wonderfull but the deck is pretty crowded. But the fitness under the deck is equally impressive with infinity run.  Make sure to book a room with city views.,4,
"This is a typical large hotel, with an outstanding design, top notch roof pool and above average service. It's is similar to some large casino hotels in Las Vegas in terms of atmosphere. Everything is good, but it lacks personal touch and service. There are much better places in Singapore to stay. imho it worth visit just once (to enjoy quite a unique pool). We will not return.",3,
"A born and raised Singaporean, I always look forward to go back home to visit. I finally got a chance in Dec 2014 and my best friend booked us in for a night in MBS and I was blown away!!! My friend checked in before she picked me up at the airport so I was glad that I did not have to deal with the long check in line. The rooms are very cleaned and well furnished. Love the modern and crisped look. View of Singapore is always mind blowing and waking up in a room with such beautiful landscape is a luxury I enjoy. Of course the pooled is packed with people taking pictures but both pools were so big, it was not uncomfortable at all. I was so excited to take my own pictures and sent them back to my friends in Canada to show off right away. Truly enjoyed my stay and was certainly the…",5,
"We came here to Singapore and stayed for 3 nights. The service from staff throughout were amazing and everyone was smiling and welcoming. We had a deluxe room facing the gardens on the 28th floor. Room was spacious and light, even had our own balcony. Room could have had more character, missing the wow factor. Bathroom had all the amenities you need. We bed was medium firmess and I slept brilliantly. I loved how everything was button operated even the curtains so you didn't have to leave your bed.   We experience almost no street noise but the rooms have interconnecting doors so we could hear neighbours talking sometimes. Another niggle was the mini bar, there was no space at all to put your own stuff in and it was those computer operated fridges so if you took anything out then…",4,
"Hotel de referencia a nivel mundial. Vanguardista en su diseño. Las habitaciones equipadas con todo los detalles que se espera de un hotel de esta categoria. Top reference hotel from quality service and from the arquitecture point of view. Its infinity pool makes a diference. Multilingual, multicultural experience. Casino opened 24/7. Also Marina Bay Shopping Center is the greatest I have ever seen in my life.",4,
The rooms had ample space in them considering you are in Singapore. The gym was small but sufficient and the Pool was great but crowded. I would recomend going up in the morning before it opens up for the public. The mall is wonderful and has a lot of fine dining as well as great places to eat that are not as pricey.,4,
"Stayed for 2 nights in May - it is an extremely large hotel with lots to see and do. It does feel like a very large hotel, at all times. What I mean is that nothing makes you feel ""special"". At all times you just feel like another visitor and there is lots of hustle and bustle. Having stayed at Raffles in the past, the two experiences do not compare. Raffles you are made to feel ""special"", even at check in you are seated and then . The rooms are nice, large enough and have all the things you would need, but again they are nothing special, you could be in any quality 5* hotel in the world.  The garden views from the room was beautiful. The pool is an experience and worth staying at the hotel for, because strictly only residents can use it.  Sundowner drinks in the Ku de ta bar is…",4,
Outstanding stay at the Marina Bay sands - prior to arrival the messages we got from the hotel were very welcoming (from my sons passport they picked up that it was his birthday a day before we arrived - which itself showed attention to detail & we were suitably welcomed -  met on arrival. Quick efficient in room check in.  The room itself was amazing. Service at the club was outstanding.on the whole considering what a large hotel this is the individual service we got was excellent. (oh they also noted on their own that we had a late flight and gave us a late check out on their own !!!).,5,
"My partner and I went for our anniversary and the friendly receptionist upgraded us to just a few floors below the infinity pool! The room was huge! and everything was very clean, beautiful and the view was stunning!!!!! it overlooked the Singapore skyline which one of the most amazing and dazzling cities! Marina bay sands is one of the most amazing architectural structures and inside is amazing food and shopping, everything is exceptional! The service was excellent and when we left the manager actually gave us his card as he posted our postcards :)",5,
"It was great place , specially the pool on the roof, you should really try it, the breakfast was so delicious, one in ground floor and the other on 57th floor, it was a crowded hotel but the service was very good .  Something to mention is the metro station that was next to the hotel , it really help us for getting easily to where ever we wanted to go ",5,
"We went on our honeymoon and it was absolutely the best choice , we had too much fun, good food ,good room,  good garden , BEST pool ever, delicious  breakfast ,   nice bar  , and also there was ke big mall next to the hotel. One positive point it was the metro station that was near the hotel",5,
"it feels so amaze while you enter the hotel . When u know u have to swim at the top , the hotel is absolutely beautiful,clean and the amazing view from the room makes it more wonderful. I suggest one should go and try and see the hotel if you visit Singapore.",4,
"Great views, great room, great service and good location.  Close to the MRT and walking distance to the city.  Well worth spending the extra money on a club room.  Staff were excellent, friendly and focused on making your stay memorable.  Wide range of restaurants and shops within walking distance.",5,
"Such a gratifying experience to have booked in this expensive hotel. Foods are great and the Infinity pool is just fantastic! The rooms are cozy, neat and clean overlooking the Botanical Garden from afar. Had a great and memorable stay in this luxurious hotel 👌",4,
"A night here was on my wife's Bucket list . I am so glad I agreed . From the moment we arrived in a Taxi we were made to feel special . Our bags were whisked away and we went to the Check in desk to be greeted with a friendly smile .Check in was a breeze and we were soon zooming up to the 49 floor (We had been upgraded) I open the door and inserted the Keycard into the slot to provide power and all the lights came on and the curtains opened automatically. WOW , what a view over the City .There was a knock at the door , it was our bags being delivered. Toh then proceed to give us a guided tour of our room and how to operate the many features. The room was huge with every thing that opens and shuts , 2 very large flat screen TVs , a King bed with all electrical controls at hand .…",5,
"First, I was there for the Dell APJ FRS conference, otherwise I might not have chosen this hotel- location was ""ok""- I'm sure like all things in Singapore, expensive is the word of the day- to get there, food, and drinks (wow! takes my breath away).  Nice room, comfortable bed, great buffet (that's expensive again).  I think the hotel would be remembered by me for the view of the city/area from the top/ infinity pool- that view is simply amazing and one of the top views of the world I'm sure.  I didn't use the casino- but there is one- and the most amazing mall is attached- i think i saw every high end watch there is here and high end clothes to boot.",4,
"I was there for a business trip but also stayed the weekend.  The property is a one of a kind location with access to the pool only for guests so it's worth staying just for that.  I was in one of the 'standard' rooms - but by no means are they standard, very spacious with plenty of cupboard room, a bathroom with double sinks and a wet area with shower and bath.  Also a balcony - I was looking out over the straits so views of the gardens opposite and all the ships.  My only real complaint is that it is very busy so check in and out were a bit lengthy for the standard of hotel - however all the staff very very helpful and friendly - I ate in some of the hotel bars and restaurants and again service was excellent.  It is an expensive place so be prepared to pay for the experience.",5,
Stayed for anniversary at Tower 1. Great staff hospitality. In fact received the best staff hospitality treatment from any hotels so far. A special thanks to Shawn who handled us during the check in. Received an upgrade as a special token for our anniversary. Check in and check out were a breeze. Room cleaniless is good.,4,
"I stayed here for a week in April, the hotel is absolutely spectacular, beautifully clean, gorgeous rooms and views to die for, could be one of the best hotels in the world except they really don't care about their customers. Unfortunately I feel they are riding on reputation alone and will fall down. From reception staff to bar staff the attitude is poor, service is slow and they make no apology for it. I was celebrating on one of the days and after a 15 min wait at a table in the bar I ordered champagne to be told I would have to wait an hour as there was none chilled (in the whole hotel???) then the wine I ordered was also out of stock so it was suggested I order another one at increased cost with no apology. Service is automatically added so no incentive to give you any. On…",2,
"Well you're in Singapore, you have to stay at Marina Bay Sands.  Check in - soooo slow, I'm unsure what the guy was actually doing, he was either writing a novel or his thesis for his ""next"" PHD. Also answering the front whilst checking me in was rude, regardless of who was calling him. When I asked another gentlemen on Front Desk some questions, he had no idea, was not even able to refer to ""Marina Bay"" as the water in front of the hotel, does he know were he works?  Concierge - only saw one person, and only once, she knew what she was talking about, I believe her name was Pathritha, I have lost her business card, but she was amazing.  Pool - just amazing, it's all about the views, why else stay here right. Although take these two points into consideration, Pool closes at 11pm,…",4,
We stayed here for 2 nights during a recent stop over heading to Vietnam. It was absolutely amazing! The facilities and the staff are 1st class. You definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommend to stay there.,5,
"It is hard to argue that MBS is not the most well known hotel (well, except Raffles) and spectactular place to stay in SG. After having read a lot about it - both positive and negative, I decided to give it a try myself.  So I booked an Orchid suite (located on floor 48, tower 1) for 3 nights (Thu to Sun) for the first part of my second trip to SG (the others are Parkroyal on Pickering and Sofitel which I wil review, too). After arriving at the hotel late afternoon after a 12.5hrs flight I was pleasantly surprised about the Check-in efficiency. A kind lady directly guided me and another guest who was also waiting in line directly to VIP check-in where I could settle all formalities right away. I requested late check-out for 2pm which was available without any problems.   As…",5,
"fantastic city view room on the 48th floor with a view of the sunset. No bath however where for this amount of money you would get a shower and a bath. Huge room extremely comfy bed. However the check in feels like you are gaining entry to a museum not an expensive hotel. No seating area. Service was fine for the money. No early check in was allowed and all facilities removed from you once checked out despite having a late flight. The pool views amazing and I guess this is what you pay for with no extras. Food in all restaurants were lovely but costly on top. Shopping mall next door we loved. Once cheer ou we were treated like common thieves and asked to pay our food bill in the top floor restaurant before we had finished eating mid meal, in case we forgot to pay he said. We…",4,
my wife and I spent 3 nights on a stop over to Phuket we had a standard room in tower 3 the room was great with amazing views you must try the pool the shopping  and the casino the only thing we found was a very slow check out,4,
I should say this was overall the best hotel I have stayed in my entire life. I had opted for the suite and requested a room on the top floor overlooking the Singapore skyline. The room was huge.The lounge refreshments were good. I loved their breakfast too. The swimming pool is fantastic. Must stay place for everyone.,5,
"An impressive place to stay.Truly a lifetime experience with breathtaking views from the infinity pools. The location with shops, casino, malls, train stations and the attractions surrounding it are just mind blowing.Our check-in was at 3 pm but because we arrived  from India  at 8 am in the morning the staff allowed us an early check-in with no extra charges. This was really cool and very much appreciated. Our room was on the 37th floor in Tower 1. It was very big with amazing views of the city. Really awesome room. Amenities were of a very high standard. The pool is awesome but mostly crowded. We had buffet breakfast on Sky at 57 and it was really good. It was a bit confusing at check out because we could not make out which desk to go to. The name Registration is confusing and…",5,
"Stayed here for 2 nights on a stop over on the way to Brisbane. Totally amazing from start to finish.   We got upgraded at check in to a superior room city view,  which was on the 40th floor.   The pool on the roof is exactly as the photos, breathtaking.   The restaurants keep the best seats for hotel guests which is a good idea as it isn't exactly the cheapest hotel to stay in!   Can't recommend this hotel highly enough and will definitely stay again. ",5,
"Didn't stay at this hotel however my second visit to Singapore and to marina bay.  The view is amazing looking over the formula 1 track and the stunning gardens.  Prices are what to expect in Singapore for drinks and food.  The pool is a must to see however you need to be a guest to use. If you ever get the chance to see Sandz and Gideon play live music in and around the Bay, you will not be disappointed. ",5,
"We just got back from MBS last tuesday. We found this hotel really really great.  We arrived to the hotel with a taxi around 11AM and stored our luggage with the concierge. We were told to come back at about 3 PM. As we were first time visitor there, we did not know that the reception desk for tower 1,2 and 3 is different (1 and 2 together and 3 in a separate desk). I did not read the check in procedure carefully unfortunately. The queue of the check in is reasonably long (it took about 20 minutes). There was one coordinator stand by to expedite the check in once they saw a long line of frown faced tourists. Eugene was our receptionist and he was really helpful and thorough with his explanation of the hotel.  Our room was 417 deluxe room with a view to the Garden by the bay (you…",5,
"Being a casino hotel, I booked MBS knowing that it was not a place to find peace and quiet. I came prepared to go through the busy check in line and the hordes of people at the lobby .At the amazing pool on the 57th floor I also  expected it full of people.  The view at my room at 28th floor fronting Gardens by the Bay was marvelous. All of the staff were welcoming and friendly except the rude guy manning the pool entrance who insisted that my 12 year old daughter was 13years old because she was born 2012 and therefore she needed her own room key id to be allowed in. (I stayed here in May and my daughter's birthmonth is September) I truly understand the reason to be strict at the gates because the pool area can be really crowded but common courtesy to the guests should always be…",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is an iconic building of Singapore. The architecture is very impressive but the hotel is very busy 24/7.   I was very surprised to see that the hotel was crowded all the time. When I checked in there were at least 20 people lined up on queue to check in. Moreover, in the morning, people had to line up for tables in restaurants as well.  My room was on 7th floor and I could still hear noise on my floor so high floor is highly recommend.  The view from the infinity pool was very good but it was so crowded. I decided not to use the pool coz there were too many people. In additions, they allow tourists to purchase tickets to this floor too.  As for guest room, it was comfortable and spacious. However, I was disappointed coz I had high expectation for this hotel. The…",3,
"This hotel was like being in a dream, the best vacation spot in our lives yet so close to a huge metropolis!  They treat yo like royalty, with modern, classy rooms all easy access to the pool on top.  The shopping mall next to it and underneath it is also amazing, eat at the delicious food court to save money on the hotel restaurants!",5,
"Stayed for 2 nights after New Years, hotel is huge! Service outstanding. We were upgraded even though they were at 98% capacity. The jacuzzi's on the roof looking over the straight are fantastic some are kid free and of course the pool is sweet. Food court in basement is hawker food style but fancy. It's pretty good esp the chicken rice stand. Yes worth the dosh as it has wonderful facilities.",5,
I was staying in this hotel in the month of May along with family. This hotel do not care about Hospitality. Over crowded. Have to stand long Q for check-in and check-out. Not worth a penny.  Hotel Staff always talks about hotel policies. Have to wait till 3 pm to check-in. Frustrated Staff. Terrible.  I recommend not to book this hotel.  Rude behaviour staff. Just money making hotel.,1,
"The hotel was clean and had amazing view from 31th floor. you can go to infinity pool from 6am to 11 pm, please bring your card because they need to check it. it's very convinience to directly walk to MBS expo and convention and to Mall. you can find food in the MBS mall, they are open 24 hour.",5,
A very spectacular hotel consisting of three 57 floor towers topped off with a boat shaped swimming pool on the roof by the Marina Bay. There are superb views over the city from the infinity pool. This is not a hotel to feel really relaxed and comfortable in - it is so big however it is ideal for sight seeing in Singapore. The rooms are very nice - we had booked a deluxe city view but were given a suite as there was a mix up with our booking and the hotel was full. The breakfast buffet was spectacular - there was nothing missing.  Underneath the hotel is a huge shopping center with just about every shop you can imagine. Every evening there is a laser show from the hotel which is best watched from across the Marina. All in all an enjoyable hectic 3 days.,4,
"Enjoy privileged access to the infinity pool - one of the must-go attractions in Singapore if you're staying in this hotel.The world's largest rooftop pool stretching 150 metres across Sands Sky Park, offering the best city-skyline view of a 5-star hotel in Singapore. This hotel is like a mall in the lobby always full house of people but they need to improve their room facilities.",3,
"stayed for 3 nights at this property...  it was simply unbelievable...  ""u get what u pay for""  Infinity pool the highlight of the stay .... super experience.. .. Royal feel being on top of the world.  A definite recommendation to all !!    With a casino below , you wont feel bored at all :)",5,
"There are no negatives about this hotel that we experienced.  Check-in was a little tricky because we were hours too early and had to fill in time by wandering around adjoining mall, but that was our fault,  The room was perfect with a fantastic view over the harbour and the light show down in the park below. The breakfasts were the best we've ever experienced.  At first, it seems so huge and spectacular as to be intimidating but you quickly get used to the ambiance.  The architectural profile is quite extraordinary - the 'surfboard' atop the tree towers. It looks a bit weird from the distance at first but makes perfect sense when you get there. The rooftop bar and swimming pool are fantastic.  Outstanding in every way, and highly recommended.",5,
"Nice hotel great design pool stunning For us though too many young children in all areas of the hotel, pool, club all floors of hotel. Had young children in room next door noisy most of the time including middle of night. Despite there being an adults only area for the pool this was not policed so children all over the place Great venue for family holiday they seem to really enjoy it staff very tolerant  Although enjoyed the stay won't be going back ",3,

"Beautiful hotel, almost an icon of Singapore, the infinity pool was marvelous and my daughter just wanted to spend the entire holiday in it. The hotel requires some time to really enjoy. It has a nice theatre with some excellent shows which are unmissable (beauty and the beast was playing while we were there, and singing in the rain was due to come) Breakfast spread was good and is served in the ground floor (full spread) and at the top floor SKY on 57 where you have a truncated menu but good views. Excellent pool bar near the infinity pool and the view from the pool overlooking the Singapore skyline are to be seen to be believed. There is a nice food court in the ground floor of Marina Bay sands which serves fastfood as well.  Marina bay Casino was excellent as well, or so my…",5,
"Booked into the hotel for 1 night to celebrate my hubby's birthday. Hotel gave a complimentary birthday cake for this occasion.   There is no direct carpark to the hotel lobby and we have to park at the Sands shoppe, follow the signs and walk quite a long distance to the hotel for check-in. Though I called the reception 5 mins prior to arrival supposedly for a faster check-in but still I have to queue for nearly 15mins before my turn. (Therefore I suggest calling is not necessary)...  My room got upgraded from premier to club room for free but I did not get the garden view which I have booked. When I first entered the club room I thought the size was that of a premier room which look quite small. The bathroom was huge! There is a big bathtub inside. The hotel also provided a…",3,
"Last December 29-January 01,2015 my family stayed in this hotel.  I can't say if the timing is not right because of the super peak rate and they already asked you to pay for the Dec.31 night stay to confirm the booking or the timing was very much right just in time to see the Singaporeans celebrate New Year's eve.  We were very lucky indeed to have the city view where the fireworks is.  And Wow, what a treat !  In the comfort of our room we enjoyed the full length view of the New Year Eve's fireworks display.  Hotel rooms are very nice and so are the service.  The concierge even help us to book dinner in the nearby restaurant to taste the very famous Singaporean chili crab.

"One of the best and beautiful hotel in Singapore, it has 3 towers of 56 storeys each, there are around 15 -20 check in counters and check out is much more easier than other hotels. It has casino in it and what more in basement level 2 MRT is there if you need to go any where from there.",5,
"View is incomparable and spectacular from the top but service from Check-in to Check-out wasn't great. Quite inefficient, non-attentive, rigid and not very generous despite price and rating of hotel. Nevertheless, it was memorable stay because of L57 & L55!",3,
"The Marina Bay Sands is a magnificent building from all angles and it was a delight to stay in.  The service was good.  We stayed in a club room which was lovely and very spacious, only comment was it could have had more seating. It pays to order a small fridge as they charge if you remove items from their fridge, but this is a minimal cost.  They do provide great coffee options & a coffee machine, but if you drink tea they dont provide milk.  They charge for this, which was a little disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Paying for a the club room you do get certain privileges which includes  breakfast and 5-7pm drinks and canapes on 55th floor, which is complimentary, this was beautiful and the view was amazing especially at night and all the staff were very friendly.

"MBS is fantastic! Convientient for Shopping, great view all u need is there. The Infinity pool is so amazing and good view also at night specially the club Kudeta and Casino, service so good very attentive staff,enjoyed so much of my short trip...",5,
"Not cheap but worth the experience at least once in your life. The Infinity Pool on the 57th Floor is something to behold. The suite was a good size and the quality of the fittings excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful. location close to the Casino and shopping centre was a plus. Restaurants on the top floor were very expensive, Platinum Card needed. Only negative was when booking online the website said breakfast was included, however I did not see on the confirmation there was no mention of breakfast. at $550 Aud per night I assumed incorrectly breakfast would have been included. alas it was not and Breakfast at $95 per day for 2 spoiled an otherwise great 5 nights of our honeymoon. Advice is to check your booking confirmation.",5,
"I cannot fault a thing about our visit to MBS. From before we arrived till after we left first class all the way. We stayed with our 2 young girls so picked an Orchid Suite. Great views, fantastic amenities and nice size.   It was our daughters birthday while there and as well as the welcome cake from concierge we also had another at breakfast in the club. Just exceptional attention to detail.   Standout staff were Jasmine in premium services and Cherry in the club lounge.   Many hotels have a list of facilities but when you use them they are underwhelming not at MBS if they have it is done well.   Next to we will be back for the same suite and stay at least a week.",5,
"Seems like a perfect location for a staycation - pool with a great view and shopping nearby.  However, the finishings of the room and around the common areas of the hotel are shoddy. The staff are nice and friendly but many do not seem trained - not up to standard for a 5-star hotel. The place is chaotic! Seems poorly run. But thankfully we did not experience anything unpleasant. Despite their seemingly chaotic running of the place, the overall experience is still pleasant... if you do not look too closely.  Not for the fussy!",3,
The hotel staff was amazing. Good service all the time. I got a room upgrade and the room was really big. Good parties on the roof top and the pool is remarkable. It´s a good hotel for a romantic weekend. The city view room is what I recommend everyone get. For the value of the room miss some extras that normally the hotels in Asia have. It's a bit too American (Vegas style) if you consider the fact that in US you can pay the half of the price for the same or better room.,4,
"We recently stayed at MBS as guests initially for a business trip followed by a short 2 day family staycation.   From the moment we stepped out of the car til we stepped back in, it was just magical. The building is nothing short of stunning and the staff are all lovely and make you feel special especially at Level 55 the Club, They show genuine interest and care but are not intrusive.   On checking in they mentioned they had made special upgrade arrangements and in the room there was a plate decorated with fruits and chocolate which was changed daily, lots of Fiji Water all free and two fabulous little cakes.   The room was sumptuous and huge, but not over the top. The bed was King sized and was very comfortable with fabulous pillows. I have a bad neck and they were perfect.…",5,
"We have stayed at this hotel twice (once in a suite and the second time in a city view room) and have been highly impressed both times.  The pool is phenomenal, and the rooms are large, well appointed and very quiet.  The room service is expensive and not that fantastic, so I would recommend making the effort to head out and enjoy the delightful food that Singapore has to offer (Sweet Spot downstairs is a fantastic breakfast option).  If possible, try and stay early - mid week as by the time Thursday rolls around it is extremely busy at the pool and in the foyer.  I look forward to spending another few days here in the future!",5,
"I really used to love this Hotel in its early days, but it really has lost its charm and personality as I once knew it. The staff seems to act more like robots and you are just another face in the maddening crowd, before they used to address you by your name. I believe this will be our last visit here as other Hotels in the same area seems to have kept their charm.",3,
...if you have the time do visit. I had some time to spare and I wanted to find out what the fuss is all about. Unusual architecture from outside esp the view from the river cruise. It's Free entry into the venue for tourist.  I was lucky enough to be able to go up and view the infinity pool. Breathtaking is all I can say. Maybe I can stay at this hotel next time just for the experience...here's hoping!! Enjoy,5,
Had to stay here one time to witness the incredible architecture and pool views. Was not impressed with service or restaurants. Pool view was one of a kind but vey crowed at all hours. Room was average at best. Went down street t Ritz Carlton and should have stayed there. I will not be back.,3,
Top class Hotel.  Near everything...great staff and services.I was joining a Cunard Liner and the Hotel was a five minute drive by taxi from my Hotel to Cruise Termonal.,5,
"Hotel is a must to stay in...from actual checkin you feel so welcome by the staff. When you checkin a staff member will bring you to your room, along the way will point out different areas of the Hotel...ie dining areas.Hotel room was fab, everything you would want. In the actual Hotel there is abShopping Centre, all top brand shops....a little expensive they even have a mini Venice , with Gondalas. I picked a local Resturant to eat in very good. I stayed as a single person, no problems felt very safe in this Hotel. The rooftop was an experience...swimming pool, viewing areas, food shops, a wonderful view of Singapore. Will revisit.",5,

"The Hotel is fantastic. The view is perfect any of the side but of course amazing the city view especially at night. Suggested to book the primary room- much comfortable. The reception staff is one of the best (around 1000 guest/day!) The breakfast fantastic every day something surprise. The roof pool complex  itself a holiday, it's luxorious, huge. The Hotel can be seen nearly from anywhere in Singapore. I wish to visit again!",5,
I stayed at marina bay stands during family trip to Singapore. One of the main reasons for staying there was access to infinity pool. However that was exactly the reason for another 1000+ people to stay there. The place was like a community pool buzzing with shrieks of excited children and their parents. It was impossible to get 4 pool chairs together. They did have a small section for adults only which was a little less crowded and noisy.  The views from the hotel are amazing. We had garden facing room so enjoyed the night light show of gardens by the bay from our room.  However I never once felt that the place was worth the money. Breakfast spread was good but average wait time was around 10-15 min. Service was friendly but nothing extra ordinary. May be it is the impeccable…,3,
"really, it´s all about the pool, which is great, other than that the hotel is mediocre, nice but as nice as any other hotel in that category. i found the hotel also too big, you feel more like in a shopping center than as a hotel guest, tourists and shoppers and hotel guests are mixed everywhere except the pool, which is strictly open only for hotel guests!",4,
Booked a club room for one night. Not a single flower or a fruit in the room. However I have to admit that the room and bathroom were spacious and comfortable for the night. An absolute trauma was the pool area. Why not have a separate access/area for club floor guests? Felt like a canned sardine on the chair which by the way are almost impossible to grab - no help from the pool staff. Pool overcrowded and somehow this special feeling did not happen. Club lounge spacious and with friendly attentive personnel. Food selection of top quality. Noise level above acceptance level. At cocktail time we were seated next to the kitchen door and I don't have to explain more. At breakfast it was just the too loud music which was annoying. Next time my SGD will go to the Hilton again.,3,
"First time staying here, attending a conference in the Expo Centre.  Had heard some negative feedback but this wasn't as bad as I had feared.  The room with king-sized bed was very spacious, around the lower-mid levels of Tower 1. The room faced Gardens by the Bay so the view was nice and green, with the ocean beyond that.  However there didn't seem to be any furniture on the balcony for guests to sit and relax.  Bathroom was also very spacious, with 2 sinks. The bath tub and shower were in the same enclosed space, but the drainage was pretty slow, so I was still stepping in a shallow puddle a few minutes after turning off the water.  The fridge had the annoying sensors where if you moved anything, it would automatically charge the item as if you had consumed it.  This meant…",4,
Cocktails by the pool when staying at MBS are a must! This iconic pool doesn't disappoint from photos.   We shared some well priced snacks by the pool while we indulged in an after work cocktail.  The pool even has s child-free zone! Perfect for those holidaying.  A must visit for Singapore! ,4,
One of the favorite hotels in Singapore - and you can clearly see why. The location is fantastic - giving you a glimpse of the ocean. The service is nothing short of top notch. The rooms are very well done and maintained. The 2 bars on top are well stocked and clearly one of the favorite watering holes for tourists and expats. This is how a hotel should be run.,5,
"We had wonderful 3day2night staycation at MBS in a club room @38th floor with city view. The room is very spacious and the view from the room is spectacular. The club at 55th floor is awesome in terms of the food and services and of course the view; the sky park swimming pool is breathtaking. The premiere service team attended to us with such warmth and personal touch, we really enjoyed our stay.   Recommend to all my friends and colleagues who wants to a have a hassle-free local staycation.",5,

Worst hospitality. Too crowded. No one to take care of you. What you pay is what you won't get. Check in time is 3pm. So don't book an early flight. You have to wait in the lobby for hours. Long check-in que and check-out que. Not worth at all. So be prepared if you book,1,
"Stayed in an Orchid suite and was entitled to a shorter queue area at the Tower 1 check in area. Long lines of people in the normal check in queue, although the waiting time did not seem unduly long. Lobby area was grand and crowded with people. A good number of China tourists. There are wonderful views of both the city as well as the sea and the Gardens by The Bay from the 57th floor Skypark.The swimming pool is crowded with people taking selfies and is more a place to be seen than to swim.  The room was easily more than 1000sqf. Separate toilet, free standing bathtub and shower areas. Dual sinks. Electronically controlled curtains, reading lights and 2 TVs (1 each at bedroom and sitting area). Small fridge with no place to put own drinks or other items. Lots of power sockets,…",4,
The Hotel is very luxurious and absolut worth its price. Good situated and friendly staff. The top level with the pool and the spectacular view is worth visiting day and night. The rooms are spacious and the beds very comfortable.,5,
me and some colleagues went their on an incentive trip. And I can tell that this is one of he best hotel I had stayed in. The room was amazing bathroom quite big with both a great shower and bath tub. The pool I won't review it as you seen all other comments ( it's an amazing view with very good services ). The food and services and my whole experience was amazing. I would recommend it for at least for one night  if you visit this amazing country.  My only issue was the very late check ins ( 3pm check in ) which is not fair for those reaching from far away at AM flight,5,
"Spend 2 nights here   Service was extremely good, ppl so nice, I was shocked from it really  Room - we had a room on the 34th floor with a city view, this was the most amazing room I have ever seen, the room is big and spacious, huge bathroom, huge bed, and the view, wow!!!!  Make sure to take a city view room  Roof top pool- this is an experience that we won't ever forget, wow!!!

The view from the dining area at the top is great, though I wish they had more choice for vegetarians.  The checkin took rather long. The AC in the room was making noises. While, on complaining it was promptly fixed, you don't expect these kind of issues when you pay for a premium property. ",4,
"We stayed here for 1 night, as most people do, because of the price of their rooms, but every dollar spent here is worth it because of their amazing pool Checkin was good and professional, Katelyn helped us and even gave us an upgrade and was very helpful and kind Their pool is incredible, rooms very nice as well Only thing I can complain about is that they dont have a lobby for people to sit and relax in! I've never seen a lobby of hotel without couches for people to sit it! Instead they just have a white marble bench where everyone sits on it, or else they have to sit in a restaurant  For such an incredibly beautiful and expensive hotel I think the least they can do is have a decent lobby for their guests to sit in, hence the 4/5 instead of 5/5 rating",4,
"My bf decided to stay at this hotel just for one night to check out the famous pool and the views. The views are really great and worth checking them out.  The pool was divided into 3 areas, the first one was VIP, the other 2 were for all the other guests. The number of seats and towels was enough for all the guests. The pool was quite crowded but what can you expect of such a large hotel? Most of the people would want to check out the pool and the view, wouldn't they?  The room was spacious, with a great bay view. The curtains opened automatically to show it to us. We really liked our view, the only drawback is the water temperature of the shower - hot water was not even warm (thought in such a hot climate it is not the end of the world).  Since we stayed with the baby, we were…",5,
And good if you don't need anything.  A breathtaking hotel with great restaurants and shops.  Just don't go with the kids. We couldn't get interconnected rooms and the reception staff didn't understand how that is difficult with three young kids. It ruined the experience unfortunately.  I got some things resolved with the manager on the third day so I won't go into things too much.  Good for couples. ,3,
"There is no doubting how impressive this place is but it's size detracts from the experience. So so busy people everywhere. The roof pool is packed beyond belief. Not at all relaxing. Our room was lovely with a great view of the marina. We only stayed one night which was enough to experience the pool, shops and casino. Glad we moved on after one night to fullerton which was a much more pleasant stay.",4,
"I expected top-notch services from luxury hotel in Singapore. However, I am disappointed in the fact that I was forced and rushed to sign an agreement of over US1 million was a bad experience overall. Sales mice director should show professional in handling international event. He threatened to release my block and meetings discussed. Management should look into the matter.",1,
"Having stayed at nice hotels in Vegas, we expected a similar if not better experience at Sands.  Boy, were we wrong.    Check-in did not go smoothly.  Even though the line was not too long we waited a good 20 minute until our turn.  We booked 2 premier rooms with king-sized bed but was told that there were no king-sized beds available and that bed size were not guaranteed.  We read through the reservation carefully and no where on the e-mail did it say bed size was not guaranteed.  After a 10 min discussion with the staff, they suggested that they would give us deluxe rooms (a  down grade) with king-sized bed with a slightly lower rate.  We were not happy with option but took it anyway because after a long flight we just wanted to check in to our rooms.  Shower pressure was…",2,
"Whole point of staying at MBS was to experiance the amazing pool,upon arriving at tower 2 had to climb steps to reach pool deck and couldnt relax due to the sound of Jack hammers and power tools being used not more than 5 meters away from pool. Tried to cancel and go back to the Shangri La but would of lost $1600.",2,
We stayed marina bay sands hotel few month ago. We booked suiteroom but one of the staff upgrade the room to presidential suite room. It was amazing place to stay. The living room was fantastic view with grand piano. And in room fitness room was very helpful during a staying. My kids loved the infinity pool with stunning skyscraper view. We had few cocktails and snacks next to the pool. Also suite room benefit such as breakfast service and club lounge was awesome.,5,
"Stayed here a couple of times during 2012-2013. The hotel is huge. The service was effective, professional, but rather impersonal, which is typical for a huge hotel, but which is good enough for me. The hotel has a spectacular location, plenty of rooms with spectacular view. The rooms have comfortable beds, good bathrooms, the breakfast is ok.The sky terrace, with bars, restaurants and the amazing infinity pool is out of this world cool. View over the Ocean to the south and the city skyline to the north. Depending on where you come from and what you are after, you can spend a whole weekend in this hotel on the top floor by the pool and the restaurants, walk over to the Marina Bay Sands shopping Mall where you can find all the top fashion brands of the world it be luxury or high…",4,
Hi wanted to take this time to reveiw the marina bay sand we stayed in The Club rooms i believe the hotel is worth every dollar and if you can afford that little bit more the club room as well free breakfast after noon Tea And cocktails and canapés you really can't beat value for money. .  The pool is great but busy. .  Stuff are very freindly and welcoming.   Great stay would highly recommend it to you ,5,
"Check in to MBS Orchid Suite, room was spacious and clean. Toilet was huge! Real huge! There is a changing room as well.  View was great, can see the whole skyline of Singapore. The infinite pool was really nice! Great view from the top! Overall pleasant experience.",5,
The iconic design and construction is just awesome! The interior is just as impressive. A must visit if you have never been there. Don't forget to go to the top of the Hotel for some breathtaking skyline views! Skip the tepid laser show though.,5,
"Honestly, the place is huge and every time I visit the charm of the iconic landmark recedes and the hassle of being in the middle of a grand terminus increases. Still, the views are fantastic, the rooms very spacious although already showing some wear and tear. The service is a bit unpredictable but they do seem to try their best. I guess, you must at least stay there once but not so sure about returning - in my case it is driven by a conference. ",4,
I love how everything is so accessible from MBS - - - You want to go shopping? There are variety of shops/boutiques inside. You want to explore Singapore? There is a train/MRT station just few steps from the lobby. You want an excellent service? The staff will address you using your name/surname and would really entertain/address your needs. You want to enjoy Singapore's lovely view? You can choose to have your room booked either facing the city or the garden side. You can even enjoy the Sky Park and have the priviledge to use the hotel's infinity pool on the 57th floor while enjoying Singapore's skyline. The staff are so nice they'll even give you a room upgrade whenever possible. Definitely coming back to MBS the next time I visit Singapore!  TIP: Ask for a room on the highest…,5,
"Stayed here two nights in April. As being the end of a backpackertrip, tis hotel was absolutely amazing though a bit expensive. We got there early bet we had the opportunity to check in right away which was great. Our room was on the 31st floor with a view over Gardens By the Bay which also was fantastic. It was clean, the bed was SO comfy and we got a free fruit plate on arrival. The pool too is amazing. That view is crazy and we never felt it being overcrowded. What do you expect when staying at a hotel this big?  The breakfast buffet was also yummie. Could definately recommend this hotel as a once in a lifetime sta- but would probably not come back because of the price. Our stay was great, but in the end I think you can get more valuable stays at other hotels.",4,
"We spent 3 nights in the luxury Marina Bay Sands before travelling to Thailand. Our room was a Premier room which included breakfast and served the largest buffet, my eyes had ever seen. There seemed to be a conference on during our visit and the 2561 room hotel was at full capacity. The hotel is like another world! The sky park, on level 57, is a must, awesome views and expensive drinks, but remember to take a room key for each person to access the area.  Selfie sticks seem to be very popular in Singapore, especially in the infinity pool. We had a bit of a chuckle watching people take excessive photos of themselves. Considering the price for accommodation, we were surprised that it did not include airport transfers. Casino is in close proximity as well as high end shopping. A…",5,
"This hotel has everything,very well appointed guest rooms,breakfast offers a huge range of cereals as well as the hot varieties,it caters for all nationalities and tastes. The hotel is well positioned,it has all of the designer stores just an escalator ride away as well as the harbour right at the door. You are also just a short walk away from the Gardens by the Bay which is one Singapores must see places. Whilst you are there you must also have a swim in the amazing infinity pool the view from the pool especially at night is something you won't forget.",5,
"Ah... the iconic Marina Bay Sands... My wife and I are world travellers and we HAD to stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Probably one of the best-known hotel in the world. Perhaps it was due to being a holiday but the cost for a room was much higher than the promotional price they always advertised. The place was also packed.  Service was non-existent. No baggage service, no turndown service, no welcome drinks, no welcome fruits, nothing. The bar on upper deck was full with NOBODY around to help us find seating take drink orders, nothing. Half the park on the roof was closed for repairs. No introduction to the hotel, location of the celebrity restaurants, how you can charge to your room and who knows what else we missed because there was no service.  The minimal service we did…",2,
"Stayed here for 2 nights as a stopover for Thailand. The hotel was fantastic, the pool was truly amazing. We ate by the pool and the food was excellent. We had a deluxe room in tower 3 with a garden view, which was fantastic The only "" irritating"" thing was all of the people with selfie sticks in the pool. I am not sure how many pictures you can take of yourself! This was nothing to do with the hotel though, just some very vain guests!!",5,
"One of the most amazing hotels I've stayed at. Staff at the hotel were extremely professional and friendly. Rooms are big, modern and comfortable Bathroom is big and neat The Roof top pool and views from the top was the highlight for me,Breathtaking. Lovely hot Jacuzzi also on the rooftop. Excellent Location  A Point to note is the hotel does not allow early check in.No check in before 12 Pm. Also the minute you move something from the fridge it automatically charges it to your room.Just double check when checking out",5,
"let's be honest i only booked a room for the swimming pool picture. we had a garden view, which is quite spectacular and that i prefer to the city view. the city you can see it all day from the pool. it didnt disappoint, that hotel is HUGE, almost a small town. the view from the pool is breathtaking. more convenient to have lunch in, overpriced a little, nothing great for the palet, but easier than walking out in the heat midday.   the only thing , appart from a very average and pricey lunch is that it's SOOOOO busy. it crawls with tourists everywere, at all times. but that's what it was built for i suppose :)  overall a great experience, it is totally worth the money. you cannot go to singapore and  not spend a night there",5,
"I chose stay at this hotel just to enjoy the facility to enter the infinity skypool on its top, and it's really worth to pay for. Service was good, staffs were responsive and helpful, plus I got free room upgrade to bigger room. I chose garden view room, and personally I love to see Gardens By The Bay from my room's balcony. Choose higher floor to get the best view. Room amenities was only OK for a 5star hotel. As hotel guest we got unlimited entrance to skypool and skydeck, and that's the highlight above all. View was breathtaking both day and night. As a conclusion I recommended this hotel for its skypool and skydeck experience.",4,
"fantastic hotel, the pool is the best I have every swam in. Rooms are great and spacious but beware the cost of a meal is very expensive. We went across to the shopping centre and had nearly all our meals their very nice and cheap. We loved our stay there and are looking at booking the same room again as we didn't see all of Singapore",5,
"We needed one night in Singapore to join a ship cruise the following day. What a treat Marina Bay Sands was. The room was large with a huge shower in the bathroom. Free wifi, although slow it was all we needed. (You can purchase faster wifi) Easy to get to from the Airport, the MRT train station 'Bayfront' stops at the hotel. At the airport find the MRT machines and use the touch screen to enter the station. It will tell you the fee, pay and you get the ticket.  We stayed on the 17th floor overlooking the wonderful 'Gardens by the Bay' park and the sea. Walking in these beautiful peaceful gardens is free. In the gardens is the entrance to the Botanical Dome which was too pricey to justify. The gardens have a free laser show every night which is best watched in the gardens. We…",5,
"When I first stepped into the room, it seems empty and I am not quite sure if it's supposed to be a king or queen size bed because it does seem small to be a king size. The balcony floor is dirty, there were stains on it. I was expecting better looking rooms given the outlook of Marina Bay Sands which has the so called image. I cannot comment on service because I did not order any room service, however the counter service is average and the view from the room is the only thing that's spectacular. We were facing Gardens by the Bay. I've stayed in better 5 room hotels which are not as pricey as this. Overall conclusion, I will not stay here again",3,
The (deluxe) room is huge (enough for four ppl) but the amenities are not as fantastic as I expected given its price level.  The food at one of the restaurants (Todai) was at average quality.  Check-in and check-out services are not particularly efficient. The free WiFi service have to be re-registered every 24 hours which is kind of annoying.  The infinity pool at the top is amazing though!,4,
"My husband and I stopped over in Singapore for 24 hours on our way home from two full on weeks in Vietnam. We were in much need of a bit of luxury after our previous few days trekking in the northern highlands & staying with locals. We stayed for the infinity pool, but enjoyed so much more. We booked a deluxe garden view room but upon arriving, we were told we were upgraded to a club room. We had a bit of an annoying delay with our keys working in the elevator, but soon enough we were up on the 49th floor, just in time to catch the light show at Gardens by the Bay from above. The garden rooms have nice balconies with individual little gardens. Our room was spotless and modern and everything is digital including the curtains. We enjoyed the use of the Nespresso machine in the…",5,
This hotel lived up to its high rating and I can recommend the club rooms with the extras which get you into the pool and gym. The pools has lap lanes early in the morning from 6.00am. I would also recommend breakfast on the top floor as well.,5,
"I booked the Grand Club room suite directly from MBS website under the Club Room upgrade section prior to arrival. During my check-in, I've informed the front office that it's my husband's b'day and I will be conducting his celebration here so I was enquiring if there's anything that can be done. He was very courteous from the start. He then told me that he has managed to upgrade my husband & I to the Sands Suite with no additional charges.We had a wonderful experience from the day we checked-in till the day we checked-out. Will definitely come again.",5,
The room was immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable to sleep in.  I loved the sky park except that it was full of people in the pool taking selfies of themselves. It is nicer and quieter to sit on the deck where the jacuzzis are. Unfortunately only stayed here 1 night.,5,
"A hotel of this caliber should not have smelly toilets. This hotel is a rip off.  I went there with the expectation of ising the infinity pool at the top, was on my bucket list. I paid $21 Singapore dollars and was directed to the Skypark, an observation deck, which I thought like many others that it encompassed the infinity pool, that I dreamed of for ages. After half an hour of hitting a brick wall with the unhelpful staff of the hotel, who declined me the right to use the pool, even as I proposed to pay extra money for one hour of use.  I asked a customer of the hotel, who kindly let me go through the pool area with his card.  The hotel should provide a pool area for visitors, as the pool is huge, on appointment maybe, paying by the hour.  The pool is huge, and they could…",2,
"The only WOW factor about this hotel is the infinity pool, and that's about it. For the rest of the things, eg. room size, comfort level, cleanliness - that's comparable to other hotels in town. There are loads of people everywhere and the hotel lobby/ lift area feels like a mega convention centre. We are given a room facing Gardens by the Bay and that's beautiful! Overall, it's still good to experience the pool at such great heights!",3,
"If you don't mind living in a shopping mall, well almost it's attached) but in luxury surrounds this is the place for you.  Because of a long wait to allocate my room i got upgraded to a club room (but without the perks) and it was definitely luxury from the motorised curtains to the shower cubicle which was large enough for you and at least six of your closest friends to comfortably fit under the power shower.  It's tasteful, large  modern design great views across the bays and everything you could want including Nespresso machine also on hand. This is a huge complex and the crowds are everywhere.  Definitely try the rooftop bar and infinity pool but definitely don't try the breakfast buffet unless you want to relive lining up at the boarding school cafeteria.  If you want a…",4,
"The staff is superb by being helpful, friendly and professional.  They didn't have the room we wanted available so they upgraded us to an unbelievable suite for one night.  The rooftop pools with a view of Singapore is amazing.  Everything from the restaurants, to the shops, to the casino.  Well worth the splurge.",5,
"The hotel and amenities were not the most amazing I have seen, but the view from the skypark and the pool were breath taking. A cool place for a visit, but if it is luxury you want I would stay at Ritz. A trip to the KU DE TA bar at the skypark is a must. It gives you some of the best views of Singapore.  The views at night are amazing.",4,
"The boat architecture and the view is all nice and fancy but the main thing to see is the infinity pool which can be accessed by hotel guests only. Otherwise, the place is just fine. Don't bother too much   Pros: 1. Open bar 2. Can see the whole of singapore and flyer from there  Cons: 1. Have to check in as hotel guest to see the infinity pool",3,
"We chose to stay at this hotel primarily due to the top roof pool. But the hotel was so much more than that. The building is great. We could have easily stayed here for many days. The pool with its facilities were of course amazing. Great at both daytime and evening. The room was big with a spacious bathroom. Modern and clean. We had city view and it was great.   We received very good service from the check in to the check out. We traveled with 2 small children and had super service. The rooftop restaurant has amazing sushi recommended to try, but be sure to reserve a table. I would definitly stay here at my next stay in Singapore.",5,
"This hotel is huge! But its also great, in every way.  So many different restaurants, where none of them lack anything, a huge casino, a super huge infinity pool under the sky, a big designer mall plus museums, galleries, bars and more restaurants! A superlative of a hotel, set in a spectacular scenery - both water and city front - with great service and really rooms. Try the Orchid suite, it's big, gorgeous, and glamorous!",5,
"Best sunset at pool side, it is a must see spot if you visit Singapore. The hotel itself is very popular with many tourists. The hardware is very good, the software has rooms for improvements. Overall, it is recommended to stay here to taste the beauty of Singapore.",5,
"Stayed here for 3 nights.  The room and pool were great, until on the 2nd day, we were locked out from our room because the door lock is broken.  We were surprised that such incident can happen in a 5 star hotel.  Although we were moved to a better room afterward, leaving the guest unattended and locked out for two hours from the room during their vacation is highly NOT appreciated.",4,
Actually i did not book in the hotel coz it is  above my bughet but i went to the skypark near the time of sunset to enjoy the day view and later the night view from up there.it is a very nice view with all these skyscapers of singapore to be seen.good place to snap some nice photos to stay with you for your lifetime.for me it is a dream come true because the view of the city from up there i just always see in tv when watching f1 singapore.very nice experience with a reasonable price in a very expensive city where you could eat cake and sipping some tea with the price of 40 dollars,5,
"Service is mediocre. There was no power when we got to the room, and it took the front desk almost 45 mins to get a hotel agent to show up, just to verify that there is in fact no power. And another 15 mins to call up a technician to fix the issue. Almost an hour wasted as we sat in the room with no power. I did not expect this kind of slow response for a hotel of this caliber, for almost $400 USD a night. The infinity pool on the rooftop is incredible, about the only highlight of this hotel/resort.",3,
"Am travelling to Singapore for the first time. Could not choose between the Fullerton Bay Hotel (FBH) and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel ( MBS) so booked both.  This review is a direct comparison between these two hotels.  I am a bit of a luxury traveller and the MBS has disappointed me on almost all fronts: it is most definitely not a 5 star hotel and I can only assume it got this rating for it's design and it's rooftop infinity pool both of which are indeed impressive.  But that is where the positives seems to end.  It started to go wrong from the moment I set foot outside the taxi upon arrival.  Nobody explained properly what I needed to do, where check-in was and whether I needed to take my bags with me or whether a bellman would take carevofmthem. Reception was very…",3,
"After 18 years, I'm finally back in this beautiful city, but now as a tourist... Now I have seen all the amazing photos of this towering hotel before arriving & yes it looks pretty impressive.But the minute I worked into the main foyer I didn't expect the expect the shear towering presence.  The finishes & architectural elements were perfectly designed, a huge light chandelier greats you from above. Spectacular!  Our rooms were on the 41st floor, a full glass pane greets you with one of the best city views in the world!  You can choice a sea view room but I would highly recommend the City View! The rooms were huge, very spacious and lying in bed waking up to that view every morning was magical.On the 55th floor was The Club Lounge where guests have an even better 360 view of…",5,
"After 25 days travelling around Malaysia, on our last leg of the trip we decided to have a nice hotel. It was worth it. I have to say it's not cheap but the experience is worth it. The cherry on the cake has to be the pool on the 57th floor. Yes it's busy, but what do you expect? The bar has a dress code from 7pm, so remember not to try to get in their in short and t-shirt like me. The cocktails are ok, nothing special. Breakfast has all you could think. The hotel has a huge shopping complex below and has all the stores you could think. Would I stay there again, I have to confess I would. Worth the experience for me and my wife.",5,
Infinity pool is like awesome. But only worrying factor pool side gardens are under maintenance. And you will more rush because lot of space is still under renovation and maintenance.,5,
"We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. The staff are all nice and accommodating. We appreciate it a lot that we were allowed to check-in very early (as in 9:00am). There are a lot of nice restaurants and retail establishments within the building that you can spend 1 whole day without getting bored. We had a good view of the Merlion park from our room. My daughters enjoyed the sky park pool a lot. Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore Flyer and the Merlion Park are within wlking distance",4,
"Our family stayed here for a couple of nights. Our overall experience was so-so. Service was not prompt. Expected more from the rooms but I was disappointed. For all the splendor and luxury the hotel advertised, they can really do much better. But anyway, we were able to get one facing the gardens where the view was great and that's something I liked. Lobby was just way too crowded for my taste. The Sands SkyPark Infinity Pool offering breathtaking views from the 57th floor was definitely an experience but again, it was just too crowded! It was close to the Shoppes, the restaurants choices were great (don't miss dining at CUT, btw) and a nice stroll to the Gardens By The Bay.",3,
"Had been warned by others that had visited Singapore, to overlook this hotel. Some had said that it was too much like Vegas and was too busy. Others mentioned that the pool was far too crowded and not enjoyable and the list went on and on. There are 3 towers here and over 1000 rooms, so if you think you're going to get the pool all to yourself, of course your going to be disappointed. My partner and I stayed for 3 nights from Fri-Mon and really we couldn't of asked for more. The Skydeck and pool are of course a highlight and although the pool can get busy,there were more than enough poolside chairs and enough room in the pool to enjoy the experience. The staff at the pool are great and even though they are not cheap, the cocktails up there are awesome. Our room was city view and…",5,
Ev thing was great . Was staying from 13 to 16 may . Without informing me they given me handicapped room and that was the it was welcomed. When I asked for change  room .didn't called back. Checkout time I told Mariya she replied positively that this is the room I have booked. I don't wanted to spoil my day and stop the conversation .,4,
"Huge hotel with a wonderful roof terrace with an infiniti pool and several restaurants. Perfect service and great breakfast. Very modern, clean, friendly. Excellen shopping and easy to get to and from - a beautiful park well worth visiting was right in front of the hotel.",5,
"I was really looking forward this visit since it was start of our honeymoon and we had wanted to stay in Marina Bay Sands since we first saw the pics of the incredible pool and saw documentaries about the facilities of the gigantic hotel.   We stayed for 2 nights, check in was flawless and service from the door to the room was what you would expect from a 5 star establishment. we even got upgraded to a better room because it was our honeymoon oh boy we where exited.   The room was large and clean, but nothing special. The problems started to arise once we settled in. The rooms AC was broken, it was suppose to shut down automatically when you open the balcony doors, Which it did but turning it on afterwords was not possible. We had the AC repaired only to find out it was turning…",2,
"Numerous stay in this hotel. My girl loves the sky park pool.... The card insert for the power supply was faulty and they rectified it within 30mins. The TV program was hang and they response to reset the system (which is lock) the shortest possible time. Everything was perfect. Nice room, friendly staff and many others. The only setback is the car park. Which I have to pay $12/day (with multiple entry)..I believe the mbs mgt should follow most of the hotel in Singapore that 1 room should entitle 1 day free car park. Hopefully, when I make my next visit to mbs,  the changes are made. ",4,
"Very nice hotel, central location and good service! The view from the room and the rooftop restaurant/bar is amazing and the infinity pool is definitely a must!!  We loved our stay there but there are many other more authentic places where to stay in Singapore.",5,
"Of course it is an amazing building, the infinity pool at the top gives you the feeling you are swimming among skyscrapers and the view from our room on gardens by the bay was simply breathtaking. This is what we wanted and this is what we got but otherwise the marina bay sands is just another hotel and because of this we felt the superhigh price was a bit of a joke. Staff at check/in-out was a bit cold, room did not have any special welcoming treat and was too cold even with AC off, shower gel was immediately gone, loud construction works near the pool area...all little details you expect to be better in a luxus hotel that wants to make the difference.",4,
"Many have written about the amazing infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands, bit you have to experience it in order to appreciate it. The view is simply amazing and most people on the pool deck are too stunned when they enter the pool and swim to the edge. It takes a few hours before the feeling sinks in. This is definitely a view and a feeling that someone has to do once in their life... The Ku-de-Ta bar, restaurant and nightclub on the same 57th floor are also great. Drinks and food are expensive, but it comes with a great view. We were upgraded to a stunning suite on the 52nd floor, which was accessible with an almost private elevator.  At the groundfloor the hotel is packed and it is all too large and busy. The restaurants there are unappealing, because of the largeness of the…",5,
"It was worth staying at Marina Bay Sands to experience the infinity pool and ofcourse the amazing views. However, apart from that, it is a little bit lacking in soul and rather corporate in style. The entrance is a bit like a train station or airport with lots of guests milling around and standing in queues. There are also long walks to get from one end of the lobby to the other. I enjoyed dinner at Sky57 and the pool views were great. A good cafe with drinks and snacks is what is really lacking from the pool area and the options available are mainly restaurant or bar. Unfortunately, there was also a very bad smell of sewage in the corridor where my room was located and this problem continued throughout the time of my stay. The Shoppes area adjacent to the hotel was very modern…",4,
"I stayed at marina bay for my honeymoon, the gave us the decorated room with flowers and upgraded with sea view. Though i am a traveler but i have never seen such a massive hotel with complete customer satisfaction services. The infinity pool view has its uniqueness in day and night time both which is impossible to find any where in the world.I must say if you are in Singapore, stay at this hotel even for a single night. The pool access is only for hotel guests.",5,
"We stayed at Marina Bay for 3 nights. Check in was quick and easy - may have had something to do with checking in in Tower 1 which was the higher priced Tower as we understood and had a larger desk with a lot of people working so no queues. Our requests made when booking for a large bed and high floor were granted which was much appreciated. When we walked past the check in for Tower 3, where we stayed, there was a much smaller desk with 2 people working and a decent queue... The room was great - for the 'basic' room it was large, clean, lovely furniture and great, spacious bathroom. Our view was over the Gardens By The Bay which was Fantastic! ! Especially at night when we watched the Gardens By the Bay light show from our Room! the infinity pool was impressive and a good…",4,
"Probably the best and nicest hotel I have stayed at.Check in time is usually at 3,but they let me check in early so I could go ahead and enjoy the pool.Which is one of a kind.Staff at the pool area went above and beyond.So friendly.A must if staying in Singapore,even if it's for a night",5,
"One of the top global hotels with an iconic design.  Service is five star luxury but discrete.  The bedroom was large and the bathroom - no bath – excellent.  The window curtains could be operated by remote control and the cabinets all had soft close draw slides.  Fast and efficient room service.  If you have the time, walk to the other side of Marina Bay and have a look back at the hotel at night.  It looks like a spaceship has just landed from Mars.",5,
"The check in was farcical as the room we had booked was not available. Reception staff were very unhelpful and the lobby was jam packed with visitors which meant a less than luxurious atmosphere. We were told by reception to wait for an hour so a better room could be sourced. When we returned we were offered a similar room and staff smirked at each other which seemed to indicate our wait was not what it had seemed. The room itself was beautifully decorated but did not have the extra bed, towels or amenities we had asked for when booking. When I was unable to find my key reception staff were unhelpful and would not issue another. For the money my view is that it is not worth it despite the view. There are just better hotels such as the Conrad where service is exemplary and…",2,
"We met up in Singapore with my brother and sister and my mum and dad as we were all holidaying separately but converging here.  Mum found the breakfast/brunch offer at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and we booked for all 6 of us.   It was nearly £50 a head but let me tell you, it was worth every penny!   Let's start with the view. Absolutely breathtaking from way up there on an overhang. The weather was great giving us a huge view of the island and the water way.   The buffet was all you can eat and there was a lot, with an a la carte menu that you could choose two items from which were more like gourmet items.   The staff were so attentive all the way through and there was no rush for us to eat, finish and leave.   Great food with views to match leaving you filled with a real sense…",5,
"Worth the cost of getting to the top. Such amazing views over Singapore. Also seeing people, who are lucky enough to stay there, swimming on the roof!",5,
"We stayed here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon - we stayed in a Club Suite on the 45th floor and were blown away with our lovely city view - we could even see the Merlion from our room! :) Had a swim in the pool at night and in morning, cocktails by the pool, dinner on level 55 in the restaurant - expensive but for having dinner at one of the world's most iconic hotels on level 55 it really wasn't that bad! the location of the hotel is something that goes overlooked as well - within walking distance to everything or a taxi rank/river cruise/bus/MRT all just there! Easy! Loved it! Would stay here again for sure! :)",5,
"I stayed here as I was at a conference in Singapore. The hotel is functional and to a reasonable standard. I chose a slightly larger room because it came with free fast internet. When I got my bill they tried charging me for the internet that really should have been in the price. Thankfully they sorted that for me.  The only thing about my room is that you could hear the cutlery clanking in the restaurant below which stopped me from getting to sleep.  Overall, I went for convenience. If I wasn't at the conference I would consider other options.  Do check out Ku De Ta though!",3,
"This would have to be the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in,(not that I have stayed in many 5 star hotels)  the room was great, had every thing in it, the receptionist was so friendly and the view in the pool over looking the city was just fantastic. The foyer looks good but it is open to the public and there is a constant stream of tourist walking around having a look which give it no privacy, and for the money you pay you would expect privacy. And now about the cost, I really found it hard to justify the cost for one night $478 AUS. that did not include breakfast, and getting off a plane at Changi Airport and finding it that the hotel did not have it's shuttle bus, (DISAPPOINTING). But in saying all of that the hotel is TRULY AMAZING",4,
"The Marina bay sands are the main focal point here, but its a really nice place to walk around, day or night. There is of course a view of the flyer and the Merlion, some very nice eateries and generally just a great place to chill out for a while and watch the world go by.",5,
"We stayed for one night at this mammoth hotel, enjoyed the infinity swimming pool, the cocktails and the rooms were lovely and specious, however everything is very much over priced, the place is too huge, it looked like a cruise ship; in my opinion, the hotel lacks the hotel charm that other hotels have, one feels like a number.",5,
We stayed at MBS in a suite on the 54th floor and it was the most amazing room we have ever been in. Obviously the infinity pool is spectacular but the staff were so accommodating to make our stay so special. The club lounge was a great place for a coffee with an amazing view.  It was the best stay we have ever had.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to visiting again soon. ,5,
"MBS hotel has a very amazing view all around, services top notch. The luxury hotel really worth what you're paying for. the Kudeta rooftop bar is a great place to hang out and look at the view of Singapore from the top. Also the rooftoop Swimming pool is excellent.",5,
"Arrived here and this hotel has 2 check in desks one at tower 1 and the other at tower 3   orig we are in tower 1 but got moved to tower 2 so should really have checked in from tower 3 and saved the walk  staff friendly albeit a bit of wait due to the sheer number of people checking in to this hotel, it was more like a city in itself  apon arriving in the room in tower 2 the views is what gets you, you get a view of the bay, and the main highlight is the gardens talk about amazing, the bed is comfortable, and the bath and shower are both excellent as well  the infinity pool is mind blowing - i wont spoil it you need to go up and check it out yourself",3,
By far thus has been one of the best hotels ever stayed. Upgrading to the club room was a big advantage as the perks you get are really good (provided you are in the hotel at the time available ). Small issues like wifi not working or the coffee machine being replaced were a few disappointments but in no way did it affect the overall experience.,5,
"We spent far above our budget for one night in this place to celebrate the first night of our honey moon.  We don't regret it for a second - it was incredible.  It was far busier than we expected upon check-in as it is such a massive complex - however the attentive staff sorted us in no problem whatsoever.  The infinity pool is indeed the main attraction but what surprised us was the fairness in the pricing for such a standout hotel/attraction.  Singapore is expensive anyway but I have to say that as a result of our expectations of the city, MBS does very well to not show any jaw dropping prices (from memory perhaps the coconut milk?!).  The breakfast was phenominal - the pastries out of this world.  The coffee machine in the room was a nice touch, and we had dine-in which was…",5,
"We were a little hesitant to stay at the Marina Bay Sands, because of the reviews, but decided to try it for 1 night at least to have access to the roof top pool. We are glad we did, we got amazing views of the harbor, the pool in itself is an attraction in Singapore. Granted the hotel feels a little bit like one of those Las Vegas mega resorts, but overall worth every penny of it! : ) Plus you get discounts to some attractions like the Art Museum.",5,
"The views from on top of the marina bay building are astonishing. Especially with the fantastic weather I had. A great view over Gardens by the bay, the ferris wheel a part of the F1 track the busy waters around Singapore and even saw some jet fighters landing at the nearby military airstrip. Also the skyscrapers in the financial district where definately worth the 23 dollar elevator ride. Other then that if your not staying at the hotel there's not much else to do. The shopping is fancy, but when i was there near empty. Haven't gone in any of them to see how the price range was but my best guess is expensive.",4,
"Well apart from a little small room size, everything else was awesome :)  Location priceless ;) Food was great Stay was very very comfortable Support/ Assistance was awesome  Very much satisfied :)  Hotel is bit costly, but compared to Location, Services, Food, etc it is totally worth the price :)",5,
We spent our wedding anniversary at Marina Bay Sands and the entire experience was wonderful by the Grace of God.   The experience was smooth from check in to check out. The infinity pool on top is absolutely incredible.   Shout out to Miki for explaining every amenity in detail and making us feel comfortable throughout.,5,
"Sure its pricey but the service is superb! All the staff are eager to attend to your needs and are very polite. Swimming in the infinity pool should be in everyone's bucketlist, the view is spectacular. Breakfast was also served in variety. I would definitely come again!",5,
"Swimming in the hotel famous pool was a dream to me, and it was a bucketlist experience. We had the opportunity to stay 1 night there, and we weren't disappointed, we enjoyed so much our stay : the hotel completely met our expectations. To begin with, we were so pleased to be upgraded in a suite facing the skyline, on the 23rd floor. The room was pretty with a huge bathroom, the bed was incredibly comfortable, many complimentary toiletries accessories were provided. Of course the view is fantastic. The breakfast, though a little bit overpriced and crowded, was really good with the largest choice of dishes I have ever seen in a hotel. Then, the pool. It is not a secret it is said to be a once in a lifetime experience. It really is. As we had arrived late at night, we couldn't…",5,
"If u r planning to travel to singapore.  I can suggest the best hotel and it is MARINA BAY SANDS.  We stayed there in January 2015. Trust me staff is really helpful. Rooms are amazingly clean and spacious. Even Indian food we ordered was delicious. View from the room is another reason to stay in this hotel. Everything was excellent. I'm sure whenever I travel to Singapore I'll stay in marina bay sands. One more thing I forgot the pool,jacuzzi in open. Everybody love it.  My kids really enjoyed. I think this is the heaven on the earth.",5,
"except about the expensive price, everything about this hotel is very good. The stunning thing of this hotel is the view from 57th floor it's verry beautiful the city view and also the bay view. If you like branded thing The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sand is the best. Also for foodies they can try many celebrity chef restaurant. Because This hotel so big and accomodate many guest, when breakfast time there is some queues at the food stall and also when check in an check out, but it's not take a long time so it's fine. But if you get room at tower 3 it's a little bit bad, because the breakfast restaurant is in tower 1 and you need to walk a little bit as you know this hotel is very big. Over all the hotel is very good.",4,
"initially was very skeptic.. whether the 2n spent here will be worth the money..  but the place grows onto u..  was it the pool?.. 56th floor?,,the height?, the panaromic views? or sheer company of frnds and family.. it gave an awesome high..  we enjoyed the pool during the day and night too..  the jacuzzi is nothing but brillant... kids pool also present but nothing additional..  casino, shopping mall, all very good.. in room dining also a good experience (2 jain items available.. way to go gujjus,,)  breakfast was nothing spectacular but ample choice..  our room was facing the city, gardens by the bay.. awesome view.. they light up during the show at night..one can take a bridge from the hotel from 6th flr to go there..  it may b pricey but enjoyed every bit of it.... etched…",4,
"This hotel is THE HOTEL to stay if you travel to Singapore for the first time. The room is spacious. Location is good. If you have deep pocket, you will love the shopping within the building that sells all types of branded stuffs. The infinity pool is crowded though but it has a million dollar view that worth visiting. ",4,
"Very convenient location to stay. They have mall,hotel,casino,garden,and many more. Their infinity pool at the roof also very beautiful even tough sometime can be little bit windy,but still bearable. Big room, luxury furnish yet pricey to experience all these things.",4,
"I spent 2 nights for exhibition that held in the same complex . Check in process was convenient and fast , there was hotel staff who helped us to register while we are queeing which I think is good idea .  The room is spacious comparing with other newly built hotel ( which usually much smaller size) , design was just good nothing is unique tho . what I like is the view from bedroom is spectacular .  we had break fast at the top level which same level with the pool , the view is breath taking from there . food was very good.  we enjoy the adjacent shopping mall which has many shops and the food court there offer many local foods and is very good . The only problem is that we confuse to choose which food we want because all looks so yummy .  overall our stay was great , service is…",5,
"The most amazing place I've ever stayed in, with everything that opens and shuts. Just stayed here for a couple of nights, at $700 a night. Well worth the experience. Don't do the detail, just do it!  It's got the lot. Anyone who does the details on tripadvisor with this place has got to be a nong(Australian term).  Just do it!",5,
"Going here for visit communic asia singapore.  Very nice place, clean room, akses to mrt very near around 1 minutes. Connect to the best swimming pool in a rooftop. Have a excelent casino in singapore, the rate room is expensive but if u have extra money its worth it.",5,
"I really can't tell you it's worth the price tag, mostly because we expected more for the price. Anyway, if you wants to to stay, I'd say you'd better manage your expectation first.  We brought along our teenage son and  here's a few tips:-  1. If you want the view and wants to save, you can go to SG flyer. The view's less stunning and it's timed, but much cheaper.  2. They do have children pool on the top deck, but other than that, there is not much else for younger children in the hotel area.  3. Book a city view room if you ask me. You can watch the water screen display every night at 8, 9:30 (and 11 on Fridays and Saturdays). On the other side, you get to see Garden by the bay which has a light show at 7:30.  4. The infinity pool's crowded, and faces the west, so if you want…",5,
This is my favorite place in Singapore. Walk around and spend time admiring the post card of singapore. Don't miss the Water show at night in front of marina shop. Sunset here ir perfect too.,5,
"The swimming pool on the rooftop is worth the stay in this really extraordinary hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, modern and luxurious. The service was very friendly, much better than we expected in a hotel with more than 2.500 rooms",5,
"I spent one night here and it was one of best stays I have ever had in all my years travelling!  The service was first class, from concierge to check-in. I arrived at 0530am and went to the pool as my room was wasn't ready. The pool manager kindly offered to keep checking on my room. By 1030am I was in my room. Bear in mind check in is usually 1500.  The pool itself can get quite busy and it is not as large as the pics make out. But it is stress free, the service is excellent.  As guests, one gets free access to the observation deck which is also worthwhile.  The casino and shopping mall was also great. Lots of great shops to check out and the food mall.  The metro station is also in the hotel as well as the river cruise from where you can see all of Singapore by boat.  I would…",5,
"Very good location and the traffic is so convenient,can just walk through the underpass to take MRT,don`t have to worry about if it`s raining~  Glad to have extraordinary view outside the window of the room inclusive of gardens by the bay,super tree grove etc. It`s wonderful to have the chance to live here~",5,
I did a staycation here with my boyfriend to celebrate him finishing army. From check in to check out everything ran smoothly. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was stunning and had that wow factor you'd expect. The view from out room was amazing and we could see the sea/gardens. The pool was freezing but it's such an amazing view. The only thing I would criticize is that the airconw control was a bit difficult to use. Overt we really enjoyed  our stay.,5,
"Incredible architecture, the 3 pillars of a shrine and the boat placed on top...those are the 3 hotel towers and the grand pool area with restaurants and pool. Fantastic views, best roof top pool on the planet, fantastic restaurant and bars. The rooms absolutely what you would expect, great, friendly staff and very swift service for such a vast operation. Can't say much more, just get on their web site and book!...you won't be disappointed!",5,
"My family stayed recently and even after an initial bad service lapse with the room allocation we had an amazing time at the MBS. Several diligent staff helped to rectify the error and from then on everything went smoothly to make our stay very memorable. Our room on the 53rd floor in Tower 3 provided inspirational views day and night. The Club facility on level 55 is excellent and the staff were very welcoming and charming in true Singaporean style. The infinity pool, although crowded, was breathtaking. We will happily return to the MBS because they showed that even when they make a mistake they recognise it and provide excellent follow-up service to rectify the problem. Well done team. We look forward to our next visit!",5,
"We stayed there for the experience . The view from the top was exhilarating . Overall a fancy , luxury hotel. The minus factor was the crowd ? There were so many people in the lobby, pool , and restaurants .",4,
"A once in a lifetime experience. beautiful modern hotel with great city views. The infinity pool was amazing (however very crowded) and the buffet breakfast at Rise was delicious. Loved how the housekeeping staff would leave notes and make animals out of the towels. One day we even had rose petals spelt out in a love heart on the bed. It was cute! Great wifi access, lots of choice of cafes, restaurants and hotel was located right above the MRT train line and Marina Shoppes. Cabs were always plentiful and it's an easy journey to and from the airport. You have to do this once to experience. Ask for a high level city view room.  It was always busy in the lobby so it was hard to receive that personal attention that luxury hotels boast. The infinity pool is beautiful and amazing but…",4,
Room & View was great BUT SERVICE WAS REALLY BAD!!...Just had a bad experince a month ago & they shouldn't rush us even though we are checking out from the hotel.Food & Drinks were great.Many tourists.But i think they should resepect your own ciziten residents.But that would be my last visit to MBS even thought is a nice place.I guess service is the most impt thing even though we are paying service charge.,1,
"We stayed for one night (which was more than enough). If you're staying for the infinity pool then it's worth it, otherwise choose a different hotel as this place is a total rip off. It is also very overcrowded. The rooms are modern-ish and relatively clean (lack of attention to detail to the cleaning, the bathroom could have been cleaned more thoroughly including the back of the bathroom door). We were disappointed with quality of service and the room, although large was average. Lighting in bathroom was absolutely horrible as there was no natural light.   Pool service and the pool is great though (would be worried if they didn't get this part right). Heated towels and the towel concierge was a nice touch. However, my complaint about the pool service would be food was not…",3,
"Our son dougs booked us into this lovely hotel , what a view we had of marina bay, water show was excellent and lunch at the pool was well worth it, staff where great treated you like royalty , rooms where the best I've been in , so I recommend this hotel to anyone who is thinking of going Singapore for a holiday ",5,
"The stay at this Hotel was on our bucket list, to be able to swim in the Infinity Pool and to observe the wonderful view that is now in our memories, this is just amazing. We didnt have dinner or breakfast here, as there is so any places around to get food, fantastic view, so close to transport and spectacular views of the laser show from either your room or in the pool. Fanastic location.",5,
"I've been luck enough to experience several top end hotels in Singapore, and even more across Asia. In comparison with others, this was a real disappointment. The breakfast experience was terrible. We had a 10-15 minute wait for a table, then had to fight our way through large crowds at every station, only to find food that wasn't hot, and of a quality much lower than my expectations for such an establishment. I was astonished by the price of the room, compared to Raffles, Shangri-La or Marriott, even more so by the standard room which was advised to be a premium room. I am convinced that the novelty of this hotel will soon wear off, and that prices & occupancy levels will fall, enabling them to focus on service. A waste of S$1'000 I'm afraid to say. The second day we even took…",3,
Stay was pleasant. Had twin room on 9th floor which was quite low level in my opinion. Clean interior but no bath tub for kids. Check in was fast and valet was prompt but required $12 payment for 24 hours parking. View from highest level at observation deck was superb and unmatched. ,4,
"We stay in Marina Bay for 3 nights on congress. How hotel looks everybody knows. Architecture is fantastic, shape, infinity pool is salfie must do thnig).  Rooms are very ok, especially this from Garden by The Bay side. You can imagine seating on tarras at Night and look for all this 18 lighting at night Tree. Perfect time  Im surprise but buffet dinner in Rise restaurant was amazing. Very big choice, quality of food, taste.   Location cannot be better.   Only one thing. Hotel is huge. Poeple walking all day and night. Not only residents but a lot of tourists. Hotel lobby, 3 towers are like traum station) but who coming to hotel stay IN lobby)  Great choice. ",5,
"we decided while in Singapore we had to stop here as it is so famous. We had a city view room on the 36th floor The view was beautiful, I became mesmerised. The room is somewhat dated and used but clean and tidy. We had little intention of spending much time in the room as we wanted the pool.  The staff were fantastic, our room was not ready so they provided a place for me to change and gave us pool passes so we could go to the pool while they finished out room.  The pool is very clean and tidy, the view however is worth every penny of the overpriced room.  So relaxed in the pool area. The bar service is somewhat slow, order your drink before you have finished your last or suffer dehydration.  We also tried the pool side restaurant. The food was good but over priced for how…",4,
We stayed for two days during 2014. The accommodation was good but not that good for a 5 star rated hotel. We had two rooms between two couples. One with a city view and another overlooking ‘Gardens by the Bay’. On arrival our first impressions were not that great as one of our rooms was not ready and would not be available until late in the afternoon. Given the exorbitant prices at Marina Bay Sands this was far from what you would expect for this class of hotel.  The reception staff were quite indifferent to our problems so we all went to our room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay where we left our bags and made a brief tour of Singapore until our other City View room was available. The reception staff did not offer to move our baggage when the other room became available. We…,3,
"Glad we stayed here to swim in the highest pool I the world as you have to be a guest to swim but you can just go up to bar or lookout which in my opinion would be a good idea. The hotel is of course massive! But if you are looking for somewhere for a nice holiday spot in Singapore it is not at all relaxing, you certainly don't feel like you want to spend time laying around by the pool it is just too busy The room was nice but didn't like that we had to hire a fridge for the room that was bought up on a trolley and plonked in the room taking up space!it cost $10.00  Breakfast was nice and with so many people they had it all very well organised, while in the queue (that moves fast) they have a coffe/tea table and also serve nice fruit, one thing that is very off putting is and…",3,
"Went to spore last week and decided to book MBS hotel.  Price was a bit high but all worth it as you pay for the good service, spacious room, huge toilet , comfy bed etc... ohhh and last but not least... what a luxury room with Wonderful View as my room was facing Gardens by the bay with balcony :D  Negative- i saw a small cockroach on the carpet :/ i had no idea where it came from.... *i did capture but didn't complain to management.... was thinking shall i?",5,
"This is an example of very recommendable hotel. For different things: -location: In the marina bay itself. Really well communicated! -rooms: luxurious great rooms. With wonderful views, to the ocean or to the bay!  -if you have access to the club. In luxury rooms. It's really a great experience. With good food, excellent service!  In summary this is a very recommendable summary!  PS maybe the only problem is the check in in the great lobby with a lot of peasants around... But nothing important!!  ",5,
"Our second time here .... We loved it so much last time we decided to indulge again. Not disappointed at all. Once again checked in at 10 am after an early morning flight. Fully expecting to wait for our room however we were not only able to check in immediately but had an upgrade to an Orchard room suite. I hadn't told my son of our upgrade so his face when we walked into our massive suite on the 46th floor was worth our saving money to stay here. City view spectacular from lounge room.  Separate bedroom which also incorporated the city view. Our bathroom encompassed the garden view... We all sat on the bath that evening and watched the light show to then walk to the lounge room to watch the evening light show there. Room was wonderful, clean . Our only whinge is the bar fridge…",5,
"Definitely one of a kind! The rooms are well appointed, spacious and clean. Quality toiletries. Attentive service. The infinity pool deserves your visit, but if and only if you are hotel guests. Save money and reward yourselves.",5,
Stayed there with my family before the Linar New Year. Very crowded but the view from the room was to die for. The gym is located on the 55th floor and has a sweeping view of the bay. Didn't eat at the hotel though except for breakfast. Overall a very good stay.,5,
I couldn't fault this hotel. My partner and I were impressed as soon as we checked in. It was my partner's birthday when we arrived and we not only got a room upgrade but also a 'happy birthday' cake. Our room was big and so elegant. I love the gym and of course the infamous pool. Try sunrise yoga as well.,5,
"It's beautiful yes. The service is good yes. The views are unsurpassed yes. But something is missing, I think it may be the exorbitant price for everything here, you expect high end and I not often have issue with price but find this hotel is a little pretentious, dinner for myself and daughter in buffet on first night over $200, yes it was good but it was....a buffet. With this expense I would expect Premium service to match, I had 2 drinks dropped on me at the pool by a waiter, poor girl apologised and supervisor pored water over our thongs (I had to ask for it) that were covered in beer but nothing further, no surprise and delight to smooth over the experience that would make us talk about when we went home. The movie selection is extremely limited. All in all I think a hotel…",4,
"It was tenth  day of  Chinese New year on the 23 February 2015. My wife and I decided to spend a quiet two  week end stay at the newest local attraction and icon in Singapore ..the Marina Bay Sands Resort Hotel.   It was  built by a well know Israeli architect on  land overlooking the South China Sea in the South and the beautiful Gardens on the Bay.   We had an opportunity to wander around the Park, or take a buggy ride to see the fabulous buildings with the air con plants from all over the world.  As it was Chinese New year, we took a buggy to the Chinese Pavilion and saw the peonies, carnations, roses all beautiful grown in that air con enclosure . Not far from it was the Majestic Restaurant on the Bay , where we had a delicious Lobster noodles.  A stroll to the Museum of…",5,
This iconic hotel is a must stay hotel while visiting singapore. it is not just a hotel but more like landmark and everything else that you would be looking for in singapore. connected to many restaurants and shopping mall. infamous roof top infinity pool is for guest access only and they do check your room key per person when entering the pool area. they also have sky park which is great view of singapore. we had a beautiful room overlooking whole singapore must see sights and it was very beautiful. Everything at this hotel is top notch and you will love everything from convenience to luxury dining on site. Stuff are helpful and kind but check in line do get busy at times so be sure to build some time for check in time.,5,
Just wow! Exquisite! Photographs almost do it justice but this is one that you just have to see for yourself. We had a spacious room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the bay and the roof top pool is just fabulous!,5,
The aim of my stay was just to enable us to view and swim in the roof top infinity pool. You must be staying as a guest to gain entry. Room cost $795AUD the night. The price is over rated for the stay. Everything you would expect though for a 5 star hotel.,5,
"We were told that marina bay sands ways the best place to stay in Singapore, so we have been left very disappointed. We were on our honeymoon and had just came from the Maldives so maybe the comparisons made us resent it more, but marina bay is very expensive so we expected the best! The hotel is VERY child friendly, even in the club for drinks and canapés they are there, every nice resteraunt they are running around and the life guards are very slow at enforcing the child free area of the pool. I just found it very frustrating not being able to have a quiet meal, even when you are paying $900+ for a couple. I found most of the staff we dealt with at resteraunts around the hotel very rude, Ku De Ta was the worst. Saying that we had a wonderful experience with the staff at Sky…",3,
"My friend got me a room to celebrate my birthday last month here. I was pleasantly surprised to be honest. Check in is stated at 3pm, however I went just after 2pm and was able to check in pretty quickly. The room (we got a premium one) was really huge and had a pretty big balcony (we were on the 12th floor, and I know the higher up you go, the smaller your balcony becomes so I'm quite happy with the floor we got) overlooking Gardens by the Bay - which was good too as my boyfriend smokes so he could go out to smoke. The bathroom was large as well, with both a shower and bathtub, and 2 separate sinks.  We were give 3 key cards which was perfect so that meant 3 guests could go up to the pool on the top floor - take note that the pool is overcrowded during the day, but still worth…",4,
Roof top pool is fantastic with views across Singapore. Bar is very expensive as it price to stay but to be expected. Room was very spacious and located directly opposite to exhibition hall. Didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast which was good but again expensive.,5,

"Nice location and very near to a shopping mall. Big swimming pool, good service and many snacks and soft drinks provided. From the room, the scenery of the beach can be seen. A little dislike is the bathroom just beside the bed as less of space.",5,
"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands for some luxury before beginning a year of backpacking. It did not disappoint! From the moment we arrived, tired and jetlagged after a 13 hour flight, we were greeted by a friendly and helpful member of staff who told us although our room was not yet ready, we were welcome to use the gym's facilities to freshen up. On the 55th floor we got our first glimpse of the stunning view that surrounds the hotel, and the shower room and facilities were great. We had decided to get a sightseeing bus to fill the time before we could check in, and to get to grips with the city (the concierge gave us discount vouchers which was a bonus), during which we were delighted to receive a phone call telling us our room was ready, 3 hours earlier than it was supposed to…",5,
"This was our second stay the Marina Bay Sands.  Our last stay in 2011.  We arrived to check-in at 1:30 AM Monday after having flown for 20+ hours.  Upon arrival in Singapore, we learned that our luggage did not make it, but that's another story for another review of the airline.  Needless to say we were frustrated and tired.  Upon check-in the gentleman, I believe his name was Shawn, asked where our luggage was and I told him that it had been lost but was supposed to arrive the next day.  He asked for copies of the claim where we reported our bags missing and the copies of the checked bag tags.  Monday afternoon when we returned from buying clothes and toiletries to get by there was a letter in our room from Nazeerah Nazir, in concierge.  The letter was personal, and detailed…",4,
"This stunning hotel offers first class service from the moment you step through the door. They were very sensitive to the fact that we had just walked off a long haul flight, and made our room available at 8 30 in the morning.    The room and the view were just gorgeous. The Hotel is attached to a mall, that has boats running through the shops. There is also a tube station there, which takes you to all over Singapore.   The stunning gardens by the bay, are right next door. The roof pool is exactly how you dream, with unbeatable views of Singapore. There are several restaurants on the roof, and we had lunch at one, and dinner at another.   The bets bit of all was the hotels SKYBAR. Very atmospheric, views to die for and very expensive. But you get what you pay for and this bar…",5,
"My wife and I went to Singapore for four nights this week and we stayed at this hotel , very nice location with nice views , our room was at the 48th floor. The room was very big and comfortable , nothing fancy but nice. Don't miss dinner at Sky on 57 Restaurant , good food and at night the view is spectacular. There are plenty of restaurants around and very good. Singapore is a nice city to visit , friendly people and a lot of shopping , easy to go around. ",4,
"Big, brash, on the bay, 57 storeys high: a 5 star hotel overrun with people with the lobby feeling like an airport transit lounge. Breathtaking views of the cityscape by night from the rooftop bars and restaurants. Spectacular location for the pool but overrun with people. Good sized rooms as you would expect. Location only so so.",4,
"i stayed at a Premium Room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. the view was magnificent, especially at night when the light show put on. the infinity pool and Ku De Ta bar next to it provided breathtaking view of the city. the bathroom was also great, though i was a bit disappointed that there was no audio system installed in it which is quite common among Thai hotels, even the less luxury ones. the TV channels offered were also of limited choice. the gym was a bit small though its view was superb. apart from these my staying experience was great.",4,
"Got to stay in one of the deluxe rooms, on the 47th floor. Was an incredible view and experience! The infinity pool was incredible, lucky enough to tick that off my bucket list. the beds were also super comfy.",4,
"The Marina Bay Sands offers spectacular views and the infinity pool is amazing.  However, it is a huge hotel with not much within easy walking distance.  The lobbies are a mass of people pretty much 24/7.  The service is great but I prefer a smaller more intimate hotel with non-hotel restaurants within easy walking distance. ",3,
"What an amazing facility, it is truly amazing and you need time to appreciate it as there is so much to do just within the resort, the light shows are breathtaking. The staff are very attentive, personable & helpful except on the weekends evenings when the hotel is flooded with the general public and the concierge cease to exist or care, it's all for one if you require a taxi and good luck!  The rooms are very spacious and I could not fault ours, we had a deluxe city view, I would have booked a club room but as we were not going to be here in the evenings it would have been a waste, I'm a foodie so again this hotel hits the mark with some amazing restaurants, ""BUT"" and it's a big but, I wish I had of booked a club room as this hotel's breakfast facility is totally inadequate, I…",4,
"Chose to stay here as we saw it being built last time we were in Singapore and wanted to use the infinity pool and admire the views. This is a resort hotel meaning it is very busy and unlike many hotels, there is not a conventional area in the lobby where you can just sit down. The lobby is so busy it is like a railway station , long queues at the check in desks and the only areas to sit are in restaurants or cafes.The room was very good, but not as good as the rooms we had stayed in in China. There was little space to hang towels, bathrobes, swim suits in the bathroom, even though you were encouraged to re-use your towel.No drawers in the bathroom vanity unit, meaning all your bits and pieces were strewn over the counter top and the magnifying mirror was not illuminated. I may…",4,
"The place and hotel is very nice and we had a great time. It's a pretty expensive place and you pay more for the 'grand' location than for the actual service you receive. We arrive at 5pm and we checked in, the people at Check in were very slow and the room was not yet available. We managed to access our room at 8pm. Unacceptable! Also, at check out, it took more than 30mins to check out, the lady was typing a lot on the computer and we had no idea what she was doing. At the end she presented a bill that was mostly wrong. The breakfast was part of the rate we paid but they charged it in addition. The lady removed it and printed put a paper which she asked us to signed which stated that this was going to be removed from the bill. So we paid and left. A week later I saw an…",3,
"This hotel has everything you need. Its designed for you to just enjoy yourself..From the spa, to shopping options, to dining options to casino. We stay here for 3 nights in a club room, which I have to say Is a must... its amazing and fantastic value. You have breakfast, then afternoon tea, then drinks and canapés all included. There is so much choice you would not need to eat after all that. And lots of choice when it comes to drinks. If you get a chance please book the club room worth every penny.. Believe me",5,
"The hotel is wonderful with extremely good service. Being in the heart of the city it offers an unforgettable experience.Loved the infinity swimming pool, loved the view, enjoyed at Sky bar! Very good service ! Loved the design of this hotel! It was awesome",4,
"I had to book the orchid suite for 2 nights for a family birthday celebration as I was told that it was a ""peak"" period. When we arrived we had told guest services to expect a few more guests to arrive as the room was big.  The room was spacious and clean so we are ok with it.  The issue started when we went up to the infinity pool we were extremely surprised to find out that per key card only entitled us to an entry to the infinity pool. It was an extremely a let down to my family and I to find out that a suite that fits 6 or more people we were only allowed 2 entries due to the number of key cards given.   I was also extremely unpleased when the ""security/checker"" rudely told us that they are only allowed 2 entry and kept pointing to the rules. They did not bother when we…",2,
This hotel is fabulous. 5 star all the way.  We arrived at 2:00 AM and a hostess took us to our room and showed us how everything worked.  View was fantastic of Marina Bay and Singapore.  Very clean hotel.  All restaurants were superb. Buffet is to die for.  Concierge was very helpful in arranging tours of Singapore.. Work out facility and huge outdoor pool were the best.  This hotel will make you feel good about life.,5,
"One of Singapore icon that you should try, a big room with 5 stars class experience. You can stay at hotel area since it already has anything inside. The swimming pool is stunning, the only minor problem is only a crowded lobby but it doesnt make the check in process takes long. I love staying here, worth with the price and experience you get. ",5,
"Well, what can you say about this hotel.....The three towers dominate the bay area and it is hard not to be impressed on arrival. We had a night flight, but were lucky to get an early check in with no extra charge. Rooms were spacious and comfortable, and being on 35th floor, with spectacular views, however no better than other 3/4 star hotels. There is an incredible infinity pool on the roof, 57 floors up. However it was very busy and not helped by a large section that was closed due to refurbishment works. There are also bars and restaurants in the pool area with a very good buffet breakfast that was part of our deal. However the bar is very expensive for drinks so beware. Overall, impressive, but expensive, and no better than other good 3 star/4 star hotels that we have…",4,
Nice and spacious hotel. 5 star in almost every sections. The room i was offered is city view which is amazing at night. They have several signature restaurants in the hotel and also nice coffee at lobby lounge. There is a big mall connected to the hotel and location is great. On the 59 floor there is a pool overlooking the city. Must visit if you ever stay here. Some of the room even comes with sofa bed.,5,
"When I first saw it it is very tall and at the top they have a ship on it.In Marina hotel the room inside is big and nice also the it was very high when you look down to first floor.In marina bay sands it all most have very thing you want.it has many shop like MCM, LONGINES, Dior, ROLEX and many other kind of shop. I have some advise that when you are on the underground train on the map Marina bay sands hotel is not at bay sands so need to look carefully. When I go is a lot of people stay at marina hotel buy wrong ticket and waste a lot of time about one hour so my advise is ask the staff first before buy ticket.I have other advise that i found we I left hotel that is the hotel card is a discount card of all shop in Marina bay sands",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a stunning property, we stayed here with another couple on 21/04 to 24/04/15. Our friends had stayed previously and were excited for us to stay here. So we all booked into club rooms. On the good side .....Firstly may I say our room was sensational, well fitted and appointed and very comfortable. Our disappointment was with the ""Club"" facilities, which we had paid substantially extra to enjoy. If we were aware at the time of reservation (which we were not) of the works which impacted the facilities we would have stayed elsewhere. The excitement of the Sands club is the access to areas which others cannot so when over 50% of the pool area on the rooftop was closed for renovation it makes for a very crowded area! The staff in the restaurant / Club on 55th floor…",3,
"We arrived at the MBS after a 15 hour flight from London at 9.00am and was expecting to be told that our room would not be available for some hours yet so were delighted with the young lady on reception who found us an available room meeting our requirements on the 48th floor - what a star I could have kissed her! Our luggage arrived at our door before we did and after a quick look around we were off to the much vaunted pool where we ate lunch and enjoyed the facilities. One word of warning if, like us, you had journeyed from cold climes; don't spend too long out in the sun up there as you don't want to start your holiday with a dose of sunburn - we were just slightly toasted. It was a little unfortunate than part of the infinity pool area was closed off but this didn't detract…",5,
"Huge, crowded,with excellent rooms ,very good services , amazing pool  . Stayed in a room with garden by the bay view ,where you can see and hear every night lights and sounds spectacle.  Price a bit high compared with others , with similar level, but with more options near by.",4,
"We stay here for three nights and enjoy it very much! We love the breakfast and shopping nearby! For three days, we can just stay here as they have everything! Really appreciate the architect and their team! 👍 Only one bad thing for some guests who want to enjoy the quiet area and relax quietly, it's not recommended! ",5,
"The hotel is just awesome, really an iconic place for Singapore. The pool on the top has a terrific view to the city (especially the financial hub, personally my favourite). The staff is extremely helpful, literally they can provide almost anything you wish - you can even checkout in the day, go around Singapore, and come back in the evening for a shower before the flight.",5,
"I've always loved coming back to Singapore. As a Singaporean, myself, I've visited many hotels in the city. Marina Bay is definitely one of the best. Spacious rooms and classy dining, Marina is a nice place for a treat.   The terrace swimming pool also gives a nice view of the city.  Highly recommended for those who wish to spend the cash!",4,
"Yes, staying here is an experience because of the sheer size and the stunning architecture. The rooms are also superbly fitted and the staff are charming.  There are, however, a lot of ""buts"".  The place is so huge that checking in (after a journey of over 20 hours) involves long queues. The breakfast room - despite being huge - also means waiting in line for a seat. Despite an impressive range of ""stations"", the whole breakfast experience is chaotic, with people milling around (and pushing and shoving). None of this, to me spells ""five star hotel"".  Apparently the place is always full - much of it blocked by people booking packages for the adjoining casino. So there are always (a lot of) people milling around, yet apart from bars and restaurants, there is no ""lobby"" as such…",3,
"Expect lots of people when checking in... Long lines, but, efficient enough staff to make it a shorter wait... We made a view request when we made the booking & we were provided it by way of a room upgrade (very good for us, since we were traveling with 2 kids)... Wi-Fi was very strong, but, they did not advise us on what option to choose & we ended being charged an additional 20 SGD when checking out due to the option we chose... As expected, the POOL was awesome & fully packed, which is both good & bad... A negative was going to Ku De Ta bar from our room in which we were not allowed to pass through the pool area & were asked to go the long way... They should at least treat Hotel guests differently than outsiders in this regard...",5,
"We had trouble getting on the date booked at the Marina Bay Sands and came just one day later. The reserve was charged obvious, but the receptionist was very helpful in offering us an up grade. When we got in the room was a great surprise it was huge, gigantic. Great decor and pretty spacious, and the room offered a view of the two sides of the city, the Marina and the Gardens By The Bay.  The pool is a separate chapter: simply amazing. It's worth staying just to be able to access the pool. The look is fantastic, the service is good. It is very beautiful and unforgettable view.  The lobby has several services and restaurants. We went on the Rise. It has buffets with a variety of food from all over the world. It's great.",5,
We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for an overnight stopover en route to South Africa.  We are a family of four and it's rare to find rooms that are spacious - Marina Bay Sands did not disappoint.  A large room with twin queen beds easily accommodated us and all our luggage.  We were on a high floor of Tower 1 and even had a balcony and great views over Singapore Gardens.  The bathroom was equally as large with a freestanding bathtub. We really enjoyed the Upper Skypark  (the main reason why we stayed).  The room was so quiet - must have good insulation as we never even heard anyone in the hallways.   We were up early to have breakfast and encountered no problems getting pool chairs etc. My only negative comment was a charge of $8.00 for a glass of milk for my son - my husband did…,5,
"Beautiful, clean room and hotel, great organisation at Front office. Very convenient for travelling to the city with the MRT beneath the tower. The view of the city from the pool was awesome!! Can't fault this hotel but if you are looking for a personal connection with staff, it's impossible with the size of this operation.",5,
"Having seen the light show from the other side of the bay we decided to take a trip to the Marina Bay - the shops are great although expensive but the hotel is just that, a hotel!  The view from the top is complicated to get to and I found no real organisation to enable even a drink to be ordered.  In the main I would give this place a miss there are far more exciting things to  do in Singapore!",2,
A great start By swimming early at 6am on the level 57th lap pool. Rooms are great (international 5 star) with excellent facilities. Just beside casino and shopping areas with international big names.,5,
"Without a doubt , the best experience of my life. I had never felt the sensation of swimming in a place like this. The views from the room amazing and spectacular city. Before dying, I must go back to this site.",5,
"Its a good hotel, friendly staff and nice rooms. But it's nearly impossible to enjoy the pool and the view with so many kids shouting, guests (it's hard to find a pool lounge chair) and no privacy, since non guest can go up to see the view. Its really noisy. ",3,
"Good for event like celebrating birthday, year end countdown, wtach F1 racing and so on,  good thing is room is very comfy, nice view over the city, the pool is 1 on the kind in singapore and comes with coffee resturant in it, the check in/ out is very fast also  the other thing is, if you wants to try your lady luck, there is a casino there for you",4,
"We spent our April 1st- 1st day in Singapore at Marina Bay Sands facing Bay. Very kind and helpful Staff. A nice fragrance everywhere. Big and comfortable Rooms. Big & modern wash rooms. Walking distance to many interesting places like Merlion, Flyer, Garden by the bay, Night time laser films, night life, shopping, China Town, Local food courts. Pool is amazing. Good value for your money.",5,
"The place is out of this world. Definitely a must-see and selfie-worthy in singapore. I find the place too crowded, too many people taking a picture. Noisy. If you 're the type of individual who's trying to do soul searching, this is not the place for you. i wish ive brought my swimsuit. The infinity pool looks relaxing. ",5,
"Check in Marina Bay Sands on 21 April 2015, very happy the front desk services, the lift have good security must put in the room card to entry your room. Entry the room i would like to say ""wooooooondeful"". After check in we go up top of the hotel (57 floor) to entry the swimming pool, swimming the top of the world and view the Singapore view.",4,
"Arrival  Our taxi driver asked us which tower to be dropped off at. The two reception / checkin counters in the sands are at the 1st and 3rd tower doors. We were dropped off at the 3rd tower because it was closer, but the 1st tower is a more grandiose entranceway.   We arrived as a group of three at around 1pm. The line was basically empty since we were two hours early to the stated time. There was no problem checking in early, though it was a Wednesday so that probably made it easier.  As a group of three we wanted an extra bed, but the clerk informed us that an extra bed in the room would be another 100sgd. We begrudgingly accepted (the other hotels did this for free). We didn't really have a choice here because this is also the only way to get a third room keycard (they are…",5,
We had a drink at the bar on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which meant no entry fees to the Sky Park. Well recommended.,5,
"AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!  We stayed here just for 1 night in April 2015 - We were staying at another hotel to when we spotted this one.... We knew we had to stay,   We booked it online with booking.com and we booked for the following day.  When we arrived, we checked in and given a bottle of water - lovely receptionists too!! Everyone was happy to help. We arrived early around 10am and our room was all ready for us. We were on the 22nd floor with a fantastic view of the gardens behind the hotel.   Most of all, we were super excited to see the infinity pool.... and yes, it was breathe taking to say the least. Being a fear of heights.. it wasn't the best idea for me to be in the highest infinity pool in the world but the views were definitely worth it in the end.  We also had food in…",5,
"Stayed for one night at MBS, as part of a visit to Asia. The check in was efficient and very courteous. The room on the 45th floor overlooking the city of Singapore was remarkable, and easily the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  The floor to ceiling windows were dramatic, particularly as we were staying on the top part of the ""curve"" and we could look straight down. The infinity pool on level 57 was stunning, and fulfilled a wish we had to swim there. Check out was efficient. Overall a great thing to experience and a must do to swim in the pool.",4,
"I have wanted to stay at Marina Bay Sands for a long time. The last time I had visited Singapore was in 2008 when that whole area was still under development. And overall I am very glad that I stayed there, but I probably won't go back again. We had already been in Singapore at another lovely hotel on Orchard Road, and decided to treat ourselves to 2 nights at MBS. Our room was very spacious, including the bathroom which was very big. We were on the 37th floor of Tower 2, with views overlooking Gardens by the Bay. It was very nice, and the staff were friendly, but the hotel lacked charm. It was very busy, it felt like a city within a city, not a reprieve from the busy Singapore streets. The infinity pool was a big drawcard for us, but in reality it was so busy, at any hour of…",4,
"I was visiting the MBS as I am told to call it staying on the 34 floor facing the gar ens by the bay great view especially in the evening, stayed in room 331 very nice room all the mod cons you would want lobby is a bit overwhelming however truly and amazing building all the staff who I met were friendly and clearly well trained will return on my next visit stayed for three days on buisness",5,
"This is the most amazing hotel I've ever been to. The view, the pool and the food are above excellent and even tough a little bit expensive , it is worth the money.  We took a club room with a city view and we glad we did!",5,
"First was surprised by the awesome city view as we're in tower 3, which allows us to grasp the whole city under our eyes! The room is rather comfy & spacious for 3 ppl, each side has a TV so no need to fight for the channel. Except the free wifi only available for 30 min & rather unstable when playing YouTube, need to re-enter again & again. The tea (tea-addict!) provided is the famous brand in SG, TWG, quite nice! A $2 note under the pillow will give u better room service.",3,
"This hotel is very different from the norm. Its part of an integrated resort and the hotel is sitting facing the beautiful sea on one side.  Being a ""quite new"" 5 stars hotel, you also get to enjoy the latest designs & technology incorporated. The room is spacious, beautiful & comfortable. If you get the seaview room, it enhances the ""luxury feel.""  Of course as a guest, you get to go to the Skypark for free - for a look at the panoramic view of the city.  But all these 'luxuries' doesn't come cheap. Not unexpected though.   But definitely worth to stay here at least for a night for that special experience.",4,
We stayed here for two nights in April 2015. Booking in was a timely exercise as the foyer was so busy and there was a long line to stand in until it was our turn. We were disappointed when we did finally get to check in as we were travelling with our two sons and requested interconnecting rooms several months earlier. The rooms hadn't been reserved for us so the best they could offer was two rooms next door to each other. They did put us in bigger rooms because of the error but the extra space really didn't interest us and it was inconvenient not having what we required. The rooms themselves which were in tower one were comfortable and well appointed as was the bathroom. My only real issue with the rooms is that the only way to get to the 57th floor to the pool was to walk…,4,
"This is an excellent hotel with the best infinity pool and view, it's conveniently located next to a MRT station, Garden by the Bay and attached to a shopping mall.  Staff was friendly.  The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 is I feel it's a bit over priced as the nightly fee is much higher than many 4-5 star hotels in Asia, but does not provide anything extra such as breakfast or afternoon tea.",4,
The area was very busy and I felt it was a bit dis-organized.  Well worth visiting the bar at the top of the hotel thought.,3,
"I spent three nights at premier room, high floor, garden view. The room itself was ok, spacious enough for 3 adults and 1 infant. I love the garden view since the city view to me does not appeal at all. In my opinion, If you wanna stay at the marina side, you better stay at nearby hotel and have the MBS as your view, beside it will be slightly cheaper, the view of MBS and the museum next to it was breathtaking.   The service was great, breakfast at sky 57 was awesome, and having the marina bay shoppes at your dorstep was definitely one of the highlight of the hotel. Dont forget to take many pictures at infinity pool, this is privilige exclusive to hotel guests. I found out that the only person really swimming at the pool was me, the rest was so busy taking pictures.. However, If…",4,
"We loved the spacious rooms with fabulous views and the facilities with the amazing swimmingpool on the 57th floor. Also the gym was excellent and the room service very good and quick. We really enjoyed having a quiet breakfast at the top our first morning but then unfortunately that breakfast service was cancelled the next 5 days. Breakfast in the lobby area was quite busy and noisy. Staff was very helpful and efficient and check in/ out from Tower 3 was quick and easy. I would only stay here once  though, as it is a very busy touristy hotel and the lobby is too busy with visitors and not only hotel guests. But it´s worth to stay here once!",4,
"Everything was perfect....from the check in with the friendly and engaging team member who upon our request gave us a the highest possible city view room available and in doing so upgraded our room. our room was large and luxurious, our bags were delivered to us and our bellman showed us all around the room pointing out all the key features.  The wifi was strong and quick. the bed was large and incredibly soft and comfortable the breakfast buffet was outstanding, a wide selection of choices that were fresh and delicious.  The infinity pool which was one of the big reasons we chose MBS was amazing. a great place to relax away for as long as you wished. the view was fantastic.  The check out was also simple and easy and the team member gave us a pass to return to the hotel to have…",5,
"My husband and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands 2 weeks ago for 6 days and loved it. It is Vegas style so if you do not like that sort of hotels then this hotel is not for you. We loved that it was connected to a shopping center (very expesnive brands) and there were restaurants, spas and hairdressers for pampering. It is also 10 minutes away by metro to the famous shopping street Orchard Rd. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is amazing but not for spending a whole day there. I think it is really for posing for pictures, staying for a drink and then moving on. Stay in a club room if you can as we saw quite a long line for breakfast for non-club rooms. The Bay view from our room was amazing. Breakfast was outstanding. Service was great. I can't wait to go back.W",5,

Will I be back? perhaps for a drink at the ku de ta but not for another stay.I felt that despite the…",3,
"Around the Marina you will find activities to suit everyone. It is a safe walking/jogging area, with even rest shelters that have fans to cool you down. These are run by solar panels. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel has a viewing deck at the top - $23/adult, $20/pensioner - where you can get a 360 degree panoramic view of the Marina, harbour and Singapore Island. This is great for your sunrise/sunset photos. The hotel gives walkway access to The Gardens by the Bay on one side and The Marina Mall on the other. Besides having all the best known shops from around the world, restaurants, and cafes, The Mall is also home to a casino, theatres, ice skating rink and  gondola boat rides along the internal river. Next to the Mall is the Art and Science Museum. this building is shaped like a…",5,
We stayed here for 2 nights and loved it! The room was large and had a great view. The pool (the reason we booked there) was fantastic. Really well located to some great shops and restaurants - really easy to get the train to other areas in the city. Would love to return!,5,
Definitely a breathtaking view from the top of the roof over Singapore downtown. Cool lounge atmosphere - perfect place to chill after a long working day.,5,
"It is important to understand that this is a big hotel. Most guests will be one of a very large crowd, even given that you have paid a (comparatively) high price to stay here.  It’s a great destination – beautiful rooftop pool, great restaurants, easy access to the shops, casino, other restaurants, shows, and Marina bay and all the attractions. The rooms are big and the one I stayed in had an amazing sea view overlooking the Marina bay gardens complete with artificial trees that looked like they had come straight out of Avatar. The hotel also has light shows from various places each night and the one from the tress was nice.  But again – it is a very big hotel – expect lots (read possibly hundreds) of people in the foyer at any given time and long lines for check-in. Use the…",4,
"Hotel with great view, excellent pool, nice rooms. Breakfast, snacks and drinks in club on the top floor were of decent quality. Weather tends to be better in the morning / noon, so if you are after nice photo shoot with a view from or around the pool - this is a time go. Stayed twice and would stay again.",4,
"Stay at MBS 2 nights in a Premier Room in tower 1, which had stunning city views especially at night. The hotel was really huge and its architecture spectacular! The check in went very smoothly (arrived at 2 PM and before 2:30 PM was in the room with the luggages) and check out was even faster (less than 15 min). The only weird thing at this hotel was the lack of a real lobby lounge, there were lot of people and group tours all over the place more like in a train station than a 4 stars hotel... The room itself was big and fully equiped, reallly like the bathroom size and its bathtub. We stay at MBS only for its infinity pool, and truly, it was worth the cost! Views from the pool at the 57th floor were just sensational! The pool was wonderful and as expected quite crowded, but we…",5,
Spent holiday with my family and no doubt MBS is one of the best hotels and I would say tourist spot in Singapore. Everyone must really go to the viewing deck especially during the morning where you see the beautiful city of Singapore. All I can say is the best experience ever! Thank you MBS!,5,
"My family checked-in this hotel for 2 nights this month. I would say that this hotel is over-rated and a bit over-crowded because there was a long queue at check-in, even if we were ushered to there VIP registration there still was a queue. I was in a walking brace and even if they see me limping, the staff doesn't seem to care much to offer a seat while I wait. Although there was a fridge full of bottled water, no one was really offering them to guests.   Since I had trouble walking because of my orif surgery, I requested a room near the lift. Even the nearest rooms are quite a walk going to the lifts. The room space is big with a sofa bed. Our view was majestic and we can see Merlion from our room. We stayed at the 15th floor. I think best to stay in higher rooms for better…",4,
"You can not escape the lines in his hotel for the front desk or many of its lobby-level restaurants, as well as the taxi queue.  It is a beautiful place, however, with an iconic rooftop experience. A place that you'd take a picture of and check the box to say that you've been there.   Rooms are nicely appointed. What a view!  I did find that concierge was particularly helpful and patient, even with the volume of people they must work with. Once I got to the front of the line, concierge patiently helped me identify a suitable place for a birthday celebration that I wanted to arrange. They called in the reservation, pressing for a good seating, and then went ahead to print out fully detailed instructions for walking or taking the river boat to my destination.   Lots of waiting,…",4,
"This is a great hotel, almost flawless. The rooms are great and the hotel amenities are superb (Gym, Pool, Restaurants etc..). In this review I will try to give some tips that I collected from my stay there: 1. Check-In and Check-Out - I did the check-in process in the enterance to towers 1+2. It took 40 minutes. To shorten the process, I recommend having the check-in next to tower 3 - that's much easier and faster. Checkout was done there in no time.. 2. Breakfast - the hotel offers a 48SGD breakfast. You can save it by walking 5-10 minutes inside the mall - you'll find a 10SGD breakfasts+ there.  3. Ku-De-Ta - try to get early, there's not much room to sit at night, as the place fills up pretty fast. Beers are better than the cocktails there... 4. Casino - not anything like…",5,
"I initially came to singapore looking for locational ideas for my latest  Joey Netherhill book. I was not disappointed. Firstly, I'm sure that all rooms in this hotel are equally luxurious, so my first recommendation would be to select a bay view room. From this you will see the myriad of shipping lights in the bay itself plus the illuminated gardens and be witness to the nightly light show and music. The only downside is that the massive ground floor area is more like an airport that a welcoming hotel lounge. That area is constantly busy and there are few places to find solitude. One the other hand, the rooftop swimming pool and restaurants are spectacular.",4,
"We checked out after 45 minutes. I will keep this as short as possible:  On arrival at this hotel the porter told us the pool was closed for refurbishment. It was a joke.  How incredibly funny when you know nothing about the hotel and are travelling with children.  1.  If you like to queue to check in this hotel is for you.  MBS is MASSIVE with very few staff.  You feel unimportant and one of the masses as soon as you arrive.  2.  Premier Inns are great and serve a purpose.  The rooms at MBS are less well equipped than Premier Inns and not as comfortable. In both the first room and the second we were shown the sparse and uncomfortable furniture was scratched, worn and stained and smelled of cigarette smoke.  3.  The view was amazing - through the extremely dirty windows.  4. …",1,
"WOW, this hotel is a must see even if you don't stay. It dominates the Singapore skyline with its imposing superior presence.   We stayed in a city view room for a week and at times couldn't remove ourselves from the view.   Located in the perfect location for visiting anywhere within the city or the rest of the island.   I hope to return to witness the Grand Prix in the coming years as the track zooms around Marina Bay with the start finish grid just beyond the flyer.  Food - no end of choices, we ate like kings and queens. Even the night where we went to the food court within the attached mall. Street style food at it's finest. We ate at Michelin star standard and Street food standard and both were equally impressive and tasty in their own rights.  The Casino is a great place…",5,
"We just got back from MBS, we would like to thank the hotel for 1. checking us in early and 2. giving us a late check out as we had a late flight this made our trip much less stressful and more enjoyable. Also, the free wifi made things much easier, this service really needs to be offered as standard by all 5star hotels.  We booked this hotel simply because of the rooftop pool and we were not disappointed, the views across Singapore were amazing, however the pool does get very busy (especially around 5pm).  Whilst it was annoying having to swipe the room key for entry to the pool it's really the only way to prevent others from coming in.    The poolside menu was a bit too basic and a good club sandwich comes with chips not potato chips. the view from the 'city view' room was…",5,
"While the rooms are of a high quality (we stayed two nights in a City View Club Room on level 43 of Tower 2) and the views are sensational, this hotel feels more like a ""bus group"" hotel due to the extraordinary masses of people (including large numbers of children, most of which were spoiled and poorly behaved) in every part of the hotel, including somewhat disappointingly, in the Level 57 Club Lounge which felt more like a large store cafeteria at times.  The famous pool on 57 is quite amazing, but very crowded, and getting a lounge chair is quite a challenge at times.  Spectacular to look at, but simply too big and we won't return.  For a hotel that places so much emphasis on views from every room, we found it extraordinary that our floor to ceiling windows looking out across…",4,
"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel, this time I paid for a higher floor, which was way better than overlooking the freeway!  We had a club suite, service was superb and breakfast in the Club restaurant was excellent with an amazing view. The downside of this hotel is that it has become a major tourist destination, not just for overseas visitors but for Singaporean stay-cationers too. The pool on the roof was so full, we found it hard to take a photo of just us. The lobby is exhausting to navigate, being quite some distance between the 3 towers, and seems to be packed all the time. ",3,
My son and I stayed here for two nights at the end of a week's trip to Singapore and while we are glad we did experience the amazing pool it is one of those been there done that experiences.  We had come from another large hotel which exemplified what customer service should be to checking in via a theme park like queue including signs saying your wait from this point is....The lobby is like a busy train station or airport boarding area and we frequently had to queue to get the lift up to our room.  Having said that the rooms were spacious and we had a view of the Gardens which was a nice change as we'd been looking at the other side the first part of the week.  We were in a smoke free room but the hallways had a very strong smell of smoke probably from floors above.  The…,4,
A great experience. The infinity pool gave great views. The rooms were very comfortable & the staff very efficient. The hotel lacked the friendly atmosphere of other 5* hotels in S'pore. Try it (once) just for the experience.,4,
"Amazing views (city view room), great service, perfect location and most importantly: exclusive access to the rooftop infinity view pool with the city in the background. All great reasons to stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel.   Towering in the skyline of Singapore, the iconic shape of Marina Bay Sands (a ""ship"" sitting on top of three skyscrapers) is becoming a major sight of itself in Singapore, so the decision to stay here was easy.  I stayed here for two nights in April 2015 while on honeymoon, and we stayed in a Grand Club suite. Since we stayed in a Club suite we could eat breakfast at The Club on the 55th floor, and also could have afternoon tea and free beverages and canapees at the Club in the afternoons. That was really great!  The hotel is fairly expensive, but was worth…",5,

This is a very large and expensive hotel that fails to deliver on personal service. Check-in was akin to standing in a queue at the supermarket.  We had two nights at the Intercontinental before a week in Langkawi.  On our way home we stayed a night in Tower 2 at the MBS.    The view was great but that's about it.   Go elsewhere unless you want to hang and swim in the pool with hundreds of twenty something's and wannabes taking photos of themselves with their phones and selfie sticks !   I regret not going back to the Intercontinental where we stayed 2 nights for half the price of one night here. The service there is exceptional.  Significant improvements need to be made if this property is to maintain its status after the novelty wears off !  ,3,
"only had 2 nights here but wow ,the service was 5 star all the way . a bit pricey though, but you expect that at this  type of hotel . i loved the hole experience to be in such world class hotel,.the room we had overlook clarke quay and the room was great very spacious .make sure you have plenty of money you will need it.",5,
"I stayed in marina bay sands hotel tower 1 for 3 nights! was definitely worth it! everything was good, the staff were helpful and super attentive. You have everything that makes your stay perfect! also liked the city very much. Last but not least, the pool on the top is just breath-taking!",4,
"Extravagant seems like an understatement.  The Marina Bay Sands (or as the Singaporeans affectionately abbreviate it: the MBS) is a gorgeous hotel which, in addition to being an extraordinary piece of architecture, is tremendously hospitable.  The fitness center is outstanding, the pool is remarkable, the spa is relaxing, the food is incredible, and the hotel itself seems to reflect the lavish melting pot culture of Singapore itself.",5,
"I stayed here for 6 nights. The rooms and property are lovely, the infinity pool is as awesome as everybody says it is. What a fun place to stay! Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, linked to the hotel by air-conditioned underground passageways (thank goodness, I'm not used to the heat and humidity). Really enjoyed our stay here, would love to visit again sometime.",5,
"Your experience starts right from the moment you enter their super fast elevators ! And then from the top, the view is truly mesmerizing !",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is a Las Vegas hotel of the finest kind.  If you did not know where you were and just woke up, based on the interior, food and shopping, you would think it is Vegas.  As most say, you've got to go to the pool. An infinity pool on the 57th floor is worth the price of admission.  While I stayed on business, I would gladly come back on vacation.  The breakfast buffet was incredible with foods from India, China, Malaysia and typical American and European offerings.  The rooms were well appointed if you are at a high level you have a great view of the harbor or bay.  MBS is interesting since it is in Singapore, which is a very serious and well ordered country.  The idea of selling a vice I very different than what you would expect.  Speaking of…",5,
"Great service as soon as you set foot inside this great hotel and everything is so personalized that you do not feel like just a number. The pool, the bars, Skypark and of course great view overlooking the bay area are a few of the highlights of our stay...and of course the casino is a bonus..great plays and live shows to enjoy if you are getting a bit tired from all the shopping and great options for the night life quite close by too..",5,
"It is hard to escape this iconic hotel if you are in Singapore. And for this only reason, it would be much desirable to include this hotel in your stay itinerary.   The hotel is accessible via Bayfront MRT station. This MRT station is indeed in the same building where Marina Bay shopping complex is located.   There are three towers, tower 3 has only deluxe rooms, tower 1 & 2 has premier rooms. Deluxe rooms are economical than premier rooms. I am not sure on disadvantages of tower 3, but i feel there is no direct access to pool from that tower. To access the pool you need to come to tower 1 or 2, but as I said, I am not very sure of this.  I booked a premier room. There is a separate rate for room above 19th floor and if you are staying in this hotel then of course you would like…",5,
"Wow, an iconic hotel people must stay at. We had a room on the 53rd floor with city view. Wow just wow.   The staff were fantastic they gave us vip check in as we were with our one year old son and the check in with perfect.   The room itself was huge absolutely huge. I'd call it more a suite.   The pool, and the sky park are a must see for all keen travellers out there. It really is a place you must see and should be on people's bucket list.  Overall so glad I chose the 5* MBS and will highly recommended this hotel to anyone.  Thanks MBS ",5,
"Due to the Skypark experience it is well worth staying at this hotel.  As a guest you will have full access to the Skypark.  The pool is not really for doing laps but more for photo shoots (selfies bla bla etc)  Although the length of the pool is defenitely for laps there is risk for hitting other people.  Wouldnt mind hitting some of the Russian chicks staying there...  Was a bit disappointed about the pool tiles. could have been much better and more colorful.  Rest and Cafe with good food available on the top.  One more thing to mention are the room bath tubs. Old fashioned type of stand alone tub, but with no lion feet...  I usually choose hotel by location and what type of swimming pool they got.  Can also recommend Fullerton - good classic type of pool and Holiday Inn…",4,
"I was very fortunate to spend a week in this landmark hotel and casino that dominates the Singapore skyline. There is no doubt that this hotel is the best place I have ever been to. The iconic infinity pool that gives magnificent panoramic views Singapore whilst having a morning coffee or late afternoon cocktail. The hotel is close to all amenities and attractions with Gardens by the Bay across the road, Sentosa is minutes away by taxi and the center of Singapore can be reached by public transport. The service is impeccable. I felt like a rockstar every time I went to my room. Marina bay caters for everybody with Avalon floating night club nearby,  a shopping precinct and museums.  The rooms are costly and not for everybody on a budget but honestly it is worth at least staying…",5,
"We stayed in the the Marina Bay Sands in August 2013. The hotel itself is modern, clean, has friendly staff, it has a stunning view from the room (we were given one of the upper floors) and it has all the amenities one could wish from a luxury class hotel. Its highlight, the pool at the roof, offers a stunning view, great cocktails and a nice holiday feeling while being in the centre of Singapore.  Usually a hotel of this calibre would deserve a 'very good' rating, were it not for the huge amount of people visiting. The hotel was absolutely packed, extremely long waiting times at both check-in and check-out. The hotel itself is also so big and anonymous, that any sense of familiarity and 'personal touch' is completely lost.   The pool at the rooftop seemed to be catwalk rather…",3,
"Staying at the Marina Mandarin Hotel has its perks. You are bang in the middle of the beautiful Marina Bay area with many options to shop ( till you drop), restaurants ( budget to high end) and beautiful views that you could just sit in one of the many well appointed benches and look at the Bay.",4,
"We stayed here as a young couple on 16th night April 2015. I thought the hotel looked impressive from the outside however upon entering to check-in to Tower 1, I genuinely felt that the interior of the hotel was not as impressive as it looked from the outside. Interior decor lacks both character and imagination. Room was very good and had a lovely view from the 21st floor and was very comfortable. Toilet didn't have a bidet or a hose spray, however this can be forgiven given that the majority of Singaporean hotels lacks this feature. Of-course given I am a South Asian you could imagine my horror having to use water bottles or wet toilet paper after paying over 400 euro for a bed and breakfast. Sky Park and the Roof Top Pool was pretty amazing at first but do note that although…",3,
"I was fortunate to stay here for 5 days with work.  To breakdown the experience:  Hotel It is huge, allow at least 10 minutes to get anywhere.  There are a lot of tourists (non guests) there, so it gets very busy. There were people taking selfies and selfie sticks everywhere. To begin with the size is overwhelming, but you quickly get a hang of navigating around using Tower 1, 2 or 3 as co-ordination points  Sky bar/Ku De Ta The top floor is a bit like a theme park, there are queues to get in sometimes and areas roped off all over the place, so it's easy to get lost up there.  There are several bar and restaurant areas, some are pre-booked only, others are open.  I found it hard to navigate around, and had arranged to meet a colleague but we had no chance of meeting each other. …",5,
"Such a beautiful hotel.  Our room on the 37th floor had amazing views over the city, a nice touch when we entered the room in the evenings the curtains automatically open to show off the view before the lights switching on a few minutes later, so lovely to watch the city lights.  The pool is wonderful, fantastic panoramic views and plenty of comfortable sun lounges, fluffy towels and quiet spots to relax, amazing cocktails at Ku de ta on the rooftop.  Loads of options for dining, we tried Daniel Boulud's French restaurant and also the buffet at Rise on the ground floor, both were excellent.  Staff were so friendly and helpful.  Rooms were very spacious, modern and very clean, we would definitely visit here again.  Somewhat expensive compared to other places nearby, but the…",5,
"We have stayed for three nights at Marina Bay Sands hotel. When you enter the building, it is crowded as guests walk up and down to reach their rooms and tourists want to go to the skypark or restaurants/clubs. Line for checkin and check out was long. Even though all the counters are open we waited for 10-20 min. Guests have free access to the impressive views from the skypark, which we took advantage of and took nice pics. View from the swimming pool is amazing. The pool was not as crowded as we thought and it is a great place to relax with city views, day or night. The hotel has a mall attached with a casino. Even though most shops are high end, there are still some nice restaurants for lunch/dinner and a food court. The MRT (metro) station is inside the mall so the most…",5,
"Our flight arrived at 12:05 A.M. and we caught a taxi (very convenient and affordable at 21.60 SGD). We went through a quick check in and lay of the land and went up to our room.  We were in tower three in room 1317.  It had a nice view and was spacious and very comfortable.  The automatic curtains opened up to the great views and darkened the room quite nicely.  We loved the amenities in the room, and we were happy with our location.  The next morning we made it up to the pool...What an experience!  It truly is the 8th wonder of the world!  The infinity pool was fantastic.  It was divided into two sections, adult and children.  The adult pool was very calm and relaxing.  There were plenty of sunbeds available around the pool.  We didn't have to come down early to stake our…",5,
This is my second trip to the MBS and it has only gotten better. I went with family this trip and we had a fantastic time. The suite we had was amazing and the club service unbelievable. My 10 month old daughter got so much attention from staff she found it very quiet when we got back home. I cannot thank the MBS staff enough for everything they did for us from the amazing food in the club to the overall service. They even sent a really delicious cake and chocolate covered strawberries for my mothers birthday. The suite we had was huge and finished brilliantly. This trip is one none of us will ever forget.,5,
"Staying in a hotel that is March architectural city is a unique experience, so I made the reservation even though, due to the large amount of rooms, would not have a personalized service, which is offset by the quality and size of the room and, obviously your pool.  The downside is due to the high prices charged by the hotel in the services not included in the rate, as the breakfast, which costs about 40 US dollar and the drinks and food delivered to the rooms and the pool where a water reaches cost 6 US dollars and a beer about 8 dollars.  The antendimento the pool (skypark) also needs to be improved, the attendants are rude and even snobbish.",4,
"Nice place to stay at, specially the pool which was accessible only for the guests. It serves breathtaking views of the city from right inside the pool. Must try for at least a night. Casino right at the doorstep is an addon.",5,
"It's a nice hotel but it's just too packed. The check-in lobbies are located at the ground floor which is also full of non hotel guests so it's really a busy place.  The sky deck is also full of people and the pool is really there for people to strut their stuff & pose for nice photos that's all. Wifi coverage is huge throughout the whole hotel & part of the shoppes but not very stable.  Breakfast, there's more varieties at the Rise. It may seem great as advertised to have bf at the top floor (sky on 57) but the food is limited and it's a cramped place. Maybe for lunch or drinks the top floor would be ok.",3,
"Spent only a night at the hotel but I can say that I will definitely be back with what I have experienced. First off, the room...it was probably one of the biggest hotel rooms I have ever seen. Next, the hotel itself and the surrounding areas, the hotel looks really nice and is really clean, it is also huge which seems to be a theme going on. Then, the highlight, of course we had to check out the infinity pool. Excellent view of the city and a really nice pool all in all.   Will definitely come back to Singapore and stay in this hotel.",5,
"We loved this luxury hotel, the pool, the room ($288+tax on agoda) and the staff were excellent.  Make sure to not even lift any items up in the refrigerator or they will charge you for it!! Instead, call a hotel staff to come and remove the bottom shelf of drinks for u to store any small food items you might have purchased.  If you have a late night flight and want to see the city, leave your luggage at the concierge and get a 'shower pass' at the reception desk.  Then after a long, hot day of seeing the city, you can come back to the hotel, use the pass to go up to floor 55 at the gym and take showers, change clothes, and soak in a soothing hot tub before a long flight!  They are very accommodating here, we loved it and wish we had more time!!",5,
"Yes it's expensive. Yes the rooms are nice. Yes its a really big hotel. Yes it lacks a little in service. Though I would stay here again if not to just get some time in the infinity pool at the top of a huge city. The bar is also fantastic and ridiculously over priced, though isn't all alcohol in Singapore. It's across the road from the underground station which is always easy and efficient so if you don't want to catch a cab then that's easy to get into town.",5,
"The hotel is very expensive because the structure itself is beautiful. But you should know that it is also VERY overcrowded. First of all, I checked in at 11.30 am while I heard that some chinese people next to me were told to check in at 4 pm. Nowhere in the world people are asked to check in at 4 or 5 pm, it's simply unjust since they pay the same price. Moreover, the swimming pool is constantly filled with at least 200 people at the time, day and night. It feels like being in a very cheap and overcrowded beach in Asia. Very unexclusive feeling for the price you pay.",3,
great views best infinity pool you will ever see good bars fantastic views over singapore city. a little pricy if your in singapore check it out worth the time.,4,
"There are lots of good points about this hotel.  views are second to none.  Especially the pool and bar and food areas on roof.  A must try and Perth a stay for that.  The rooms are surprisingly specious and clean and nicely designed.  Really great rooms.  Although it is crowded they have great logistics and service and things work efficiently and smoothly with a smile (save for check out which was slow).  However it is a massive hotel, every thing is massive in terms of the amount of people there, at the restaurant, at the pool, at reception lobby, at the lifts, everywhere.  If this doesn't bother you then it is a very good choice.  If you like a more quite and not crowded then this can be an issue after a day or two.   It is just endless stream of people everywhere.  So…",4,
"We went there on group and saw the full view of Singapore from the rooftop of the building. We had to buy the tickets on the spot which was taking a little bit long time. But once we got up there, it paid off. We could see the surrounding skyscrapers and of course the iconic Merlion. For those wanting to see Singapore, better try this one.",4,
"Everytime I check into the Sand I love going up to the pool and enjoy a long stay at the pool until sunset. Swimming at the sand feel like swimming in heaven, over look the skyscraper below. The water is chill at the right temperature. However, it is always crowded and everything there is very pricy from food to drink to the hotel room. At $599 a night is not really worth it to stay there. Instead I stay at the Sheraton for less than $200 and just look a taxi there to enjoy the atmosphere, view, the architect, and gaming at the Sand.",4,
"Not at all my thing.... Far too huge a hotel, people everywhere. No intimacy. Of course it's amazing, but that amazing'ness comes at a cost (people, cost, queues etc). The upside is there's something for everyone - eating, shopping, nearby Gardens by the Bay and the divine pool. If you like quaint, this isn't it.",4,
"Everything you needed, shopping, entertainment and casino. But that means you need to keep going to ATM to with draw more money :)",5,
I travelled with 2 friends and we stayed 3 nights in this hotel and were very satisfied! The view from the pool on the roof was so beautiful and made it an unforgettable expericence! Unfortunately it was very crowded and there were not enough waiter to take orders. We had to wait very long. Our room was on level 44. It was very clean and big enough for 3 persons! I clearly recommend it!! ,5,
"A very attractive hotel with beautiful, spacious and comfortable rooms. Very clean everywhere. Shopping, dining - everything is near by. Fantastic atmosphere at the Sky Park.  Friendly and helpful staff. They upgraded our room on arrival, many thanks to Maria!  We had a wonderful time there and would certainly be back when we visit Singapore again.",5,
Enormous lobby like a disused aircraft hangar- flooded with loud/ rude casino going guests. Long queue to check in due to this group.  Should have a separate group check- in counter. Room was pleasant but expected more from a Club Room. Stunning views and pool was excellent although pool/ bar area was crowded with people who are not staying  hotel guests. Never again.,3,
"Phone reservation is bad. The staff are unfriendly except for who manager that assisted me.  Room is great. probably with the best view of Singapore's sky line. Rooms are considerably clean. But I asked for a room makeup and what they did is just they took the trash away, bed was fixed but still look as if it was used.  Pool has the best view. On the other hand, being very clean probably would not describe them. You can see some moss at the sides of the infinity pool specially those that are near the sunbathe beds (which is found practically every sides and corner of the pool).  Location is not very convenient. Yes there is a train station directly at the bottom of the hotel but it is not the main line of the train systems in Singapore. Taxi or limo is the best travel option for…",4,
"Ultimate luxury and breathtaking views. Experience Sands SkyPark and the stunning Infinity Pool at Marina Bay Sands,been to casino which is nice",4,
"We stayed one night at the Marina Bay Sands as we were told it was a ""must do"" in Singapore.  The pool area is certainly spectacular and the views incredible, but it felt like being at a fun park rather than a hotel.  The pool and the pool area was packed and noisy.  Everyone was busy taking selfies and photos and it was the most revolting atmosphere.  It was impossible to just lay by the pool and relax.  The service in the hotel is very poor especially when you consider what you are paying.  The check in was more like an airport check in- including the queues.  No one really helped guests find out where to go in the vast foyer.  Once checked in we went to our room which certainly had a great view but otherwise was tired.  We had a suite with a fold out sofa for our teenager.…",2,
"The spaciousness of the club hotel room vs rate definitely represents value for money. Free access to pool, gym, breakfast, tea and evening canapes & drinks. The food was top notch. Also amazed by staff able to address me by name with the number of guests they have to attend to. Location provided fabulous views and easy access to public transport if required. Highly recommended without reservations.",5,
"Check in was tedious but Ai leng saved the day. We were initially given a smoking room and walked out as soon as we walked in! Family of four, asthma, no thanks. Phone didn't work of course, even bell boy couldn't get it to work, so we trekked back down to the check in queue.   Although we were happy to sleep kids on floor mbs offered us an extra bed at no charge. Our room now is only on 12th floor but has a fantastic view over the gardens and faces East! So we don't get the awful setting sun. Very comfortable.   Pool area has renovations til 5 August. Which means all guests r wedged in together! Go in the mornings.... Shop in the afternoon. Just too glary to enjoy after 2pm.",4,
"I only booked this hotel so that I could get those amazing shots, but everything from check in to checking out, to VIP treatment, to room service, to concierge was PERFECT! Blown away. The food was excellent too! All in all an excellent 5 star hotel. If you can afford it, get a suite, well worth the money, also try and ask for the high floors. The lifts in this hotel travel at the speed of lightening!   Upon arrival we were promptly checked in- lovely ladies at the VIP Check in desk, our suite was FAB, just perfect. Very modern, great finish to everything!   The staff, Jasmine Lee, what a warm welcome, thank YOU so very much! YOU went over and above and made our stay enjoyable, so much so we cannot wait to come back and we will!",5,
Our family stayed in Singapore for a year and just had to spend 1 night in the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel so that we can get access to the pool on the top floor. The pool is an absolute magic experience. The room (I went for the absolute cheapest rate I could find) was however very average to poor. Worth it for the experience.,3,
"We stayed eleven days in this magnificent hotel( it is our third stay in the hotel). Marina bay sands is a huge self contained complex. It includes first class hotel, convention center, big shopping and entertainment center, and casino. Despite the mega scale, the service is very personal and attentive . A perfect service!. Huge spacious rooms, very well equipped and very well kept and serviced twice a day and more. Every request was answered immediately and efficiently . Marina bay sand is very famous for its magnificent sky park and the infinity linear swimming pool, over looking the bay and the outstanding CBD towers. Many excellent restaurants, among which : Mozza, cut and Adrift. In short: outstanding hotel and facilities . Very well managed.  ",5,
"Although a beautiful hotel, our stay at Marina Bay Sands was not so memorable. We felt so restricted and confined. 1st and foremost the issue with pool admission. 1 room card per person. We can understand that MBS might want to limit the amount of visitors to their iconic pool but how do you feel if you are a paying guest at the hotel but you are not allowed to bring any of your friends/families there? And worse of all to cut you off at the entry of the pool unapologetically. Secondly, the pool have sections...section for adults only and section for kids. Honestly we could not enjoy the pool at all. My husband left his ipod and Beats earphone in the room when we checked out. After we realized it(on the same day) we called to check if they have kept it for us and they said its…",1,
A must go place in the night to get a panoramic view of Singapore city. The top floor has a Pool where parties happen. Reserve a entry and have a blast partying at pool side .,5,
"The hotel is impressive, modern and big. The room was lovely - again a perfect blend of modern sophistication and style. The rooftop pool is a sight to be seen and the views and experiences made there are awesome. Hotel public areas are quite crowded. Lots of Chinese tour groups, loud and somewhat un-refined. but overall a nice short stay experience.",4,
There is MRT to arrive there from airport which is convenience. Room is nice and did not enjoy the infinity pool yet but visited there which is nice too. Shopping mall is nice and many choices for having breakfast.,5,
"This hotel is one of the most famous hotel of the world, but I was a little disappointed when I stayed this hotel.  The lobby was very crowded and noisy.  Phone in the room was broken, so we couldn't call a concierge service.  But infinite pool on the rooftop was so fantastic!",4,
"The entrance to this hotel is amazing the club rooms have a special reservations desk which only took minutes to check in we had a massive amount of luggage that reached our room only minutes after we got there .The club room was great ,view amazing from room 3369 overlooking city skyline and at night wow .the club room benefits on floor 55 excellent ,staff were wonderful and very experienced food and drinks great .the pool area on 57 great I especially liked the early morning swims with the lanes so I could do some laps ku de ta on 57 was great but super expensive but the great food and view made up for that. this is a five star hotel for me I would stay here again but only in a club room or suite otherwise it looked crazy in the other room areas ",5,
We checked into the MBS for the last night of our Easter break. Having read previous reviews we decided to go for an earlier check-in and were in our suite in less than 10 minutes! Front desk were amazing and even gave us pool access for a second day as we were not flying home until very late. We booked an Orchid suite and we've never stayed in a room as big. We had a garden and city view from the 50th floor and didn't want to leave the room!  Like everyone else we spent a lot of time at the pool and the best (quietest) time to visit is between noon and 3pm. The pool got really busy and there were lot's of loud children and so do not hope for a quiet swim / experience.  The lounge was very formal and staff very helpful. Afternoon tea was basic (the first time I've had tea…,5,
"If you love the kitsch and ostentation of Vegas but find yourself in Singapore..try the Marina Bay Sands. If you plan on going to the casino bring your passport; they will not let you in if you don't have it. The views are amazing. The pool is unlike any other. The rooms are nice enough and, while there are classier places to stay in the wealthiest city-state there are non more obvious. Worth doing, if for no other reason to say..yeah, I stayed at the hotel that looks like a cruise ship on top of three towers.",4,
The highlight of this hotel is the infinity pool at the roof top and also the night club. Rooms are also more modern and equipped with modern technology. I was at room 3007 at Tower three room facing the Singapore Merlion at night. really amazing view from the top room. Going there again. loved it,5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands as a stopover for 2 nights.  With two young kids, the views over the city and the pool in itself had their eyes falling out of their heads. Yes this is an expensive place to stay. It is not the most personal experience due to the sheer size and the rooms are basic for a 5* hotel. The service from the staff was very good and they were able to accommodate all requests that were made. Overall, it was an experience that we wanted to pay for and we were not disappointed with the final result.",4,
My family and I went to Singapore for a family holiday. We live a island called tasmania and had a long way to travel. Once arriving at the airport 11:30 at night we were happily greeted with the airport shuttle driver. Very very nice person he was. Once we arrived there the check in staff were friendly and kind. They gave us a room on floor 44. Our room was facing the gardens which was great seeing that we had a small balcony.(Very very nice views.) also included in the price was buffet breakfasts for all of us every morning. The buffet is a must do and even if you don't stay there... You still must go! The pool was extremely nice and large. We had seen reviews about the pool being crowded and when we saw 6-10 in the pool we were surprised. After our 8 night stay we sadly had…,5,
"This is really an excellent hotel in Singapore. I booked an city view room in higher floor, and got an really good room at 28th floor in Tower 1. The room is clean, silent, spacious and with a great view. The infinity pool is crowded, but still ok.  The breakfast was good, but the atmosphere very noise. I think Marina Bay Sands are a must-do in Singapore, and worth the money.",5,
"With its impressive architecture, breathtaking city views and science fiction infinity pool, there is no other hotel in Singapore that can offers you this. If you are looking for luxury, state of the art shops, amazing views, and unique pool/restaurants, search no more. Ericca, from special services, made us feel really special while we were celebrating our 10th Anniversary. If you are celebrating something special, do not hesitate to contact her, she is a true professional and really knows how to make your experience, even better. We totally loved this place!!!!!",5,
I loved staying at the Marina Sands.  Singapore is a great stopover anytime and the sands is brilliant. The location is awesome and you really couldn't fault them for anything from the check in to the check out.  The infinity pool on the 57th floor is a standout feature especially if it's hot at night and the packed breakfasts were very much appreciated when you have a very early flight.  The concierge desk were authoritative and helpful and we had no trouble getting the reservations we were after (thanks Stewart)  I would happily use them when I'm next in Singapore and hopefully for longer next time.,4,
"Had stayed at this hotel fwith my wife was given a premier room on 39th floor , view of marina wAs fantastic . The reason we booked this hotel was its rooftop pool which is only open for in house guest . It's a mammoth of a hotel with mall and casino . One thing that I didn't like abt the hotel is sound insulation in the rooms was not that good I could here a super car sound on the other side of marina in the midnight . Still it's a must experience if In Singapore . ",5,
you have only access to the view point area not the pool and they have a strict dress code (business) if you want to have a drink at the roof top bar!,3,
"we stayed for 5 days at the end of march 2015. this is a top end hotel and everything about it confirms its status. the pool on the roof is out of this world, the only downside is that everyone else thinks so too so it can get busy; get there early! the nearby attractions are within walking distance and for those further afield there is an MRT stop just below the hotel. there is so much happening in and around the hotel that customers are spoilt for choice. a word of advice though, nothing here is cheap! would love to stay again in the future. have to say the staff at the hotel are 5* also and the customer interface faultless",5,
"It is my first experience to stay at Marina Bay Sands. Everything was perfect from the check-in process (although my request for higher rooms cannot be fullfiled :( ), the room facility, the Sky Pool, the gym.",5,
All international travelers must give themselves the glorious gift of staying here. One of the best hotel I stayed in. Helpful staff and don't need to say anything about the location. Infinity pool looks beautiful in night and having bar near the pool is big plus.,5,
"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands to experience first hand what the hype is all about. Sadly, it was disappointing. Coming from an exhausting flight, i called from the airport to check the possibility of early check-in. Staff apologized saying they were full, which was fair enough. I asked though if they can at least keep our luggage until check-in time, which was also declined. I found that really disappointing for a five star hotel. We had to carry our luggages around until later that day. Check-in was very impersonal, receptionist provided a very insincere smile with no briefing whatsoever about the facilities. We felt like it was an honor for us to stay there. Later that evening, we met some friends for dinner at the lobby restaurant, and guess what, there was no hostess nor wait…",3,
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for the Grand Prix last  year; Fabulous, we were able to watch quite a bit of the race from the edge of the amazing infinity poo! The hotel is fab, however personally  it is too noisy and busy for me; plus the tour groups who just come up to the sky  park to take pictures is annoying when you are a paying guest; and also the beat music round the pool is a little too much however you really should stay here at least once for a fantastic futuristic experience (and the photos!) I also drove a Lamborghini round part of the race track..****FANTASTIC*** for about £160 you can either drive a Ferrari or a Lamborghini sports car around Singapore; their office is just by Tower three; a definite must and you get a dashboard film of your drive on a free…",5,
Great view from the top. You can clearly see why it is busiest shipping lane in the world plus you also get a good view of the Gardens by the Bay. The downsides are there is no shade in the blazing sun and you are not allowed by the pool area.,3,
"The title of the review is very true. Do not expect this to be a very personal 5-star Four Seasons/Mandarin Oriental experience. This is a massive hotel with 3 huge towers, so many of the reviews are correct that it's a little impersonal but it makes up for it in other areas. We stayed at the Fairmont for 2 nights & the Marina Bay for 1 night. We wish we had stayed at the Marina Bay for the the entire time. The check-in line was about 20 minutes long for us; however, they let us check in early around noon which was great so it was a decent first impression. We were on the 37th floor facing the gardens and loved our room. We had a very nice balcony, great view and the room was super modern with all the 5-star amenities you could want!  The infinity pool is the main attraction on…",5,
"Whatever the city view side or gardens by the bay side, really really beautiful, especially from 57/F pool. Both the sunrise and sunset moment is extremely amazing! If you come to Singapore, spend at least one night there, and you won't regret!!!",5,
"The lobby area is huge. They have 2 reception areas at the front and at the back. I actually felt like it was a shopping mall instead of a hotel. Too big to provide a personal service to the guests. Unfortunately I did not have a chance to come up to the Panoramic restaurant as I was too busy with the exhibition. During breakfast, too many people passing around. So we decided to have breakfast elsewhere. There is small cafe close to the reception in front of building 3. The staff were friendly and recognized me on my next visit. For that I rate 5.  The room is spacious and clean. However with the price I paid, I was expecting more of service and in-room facilities. The room design is too average.  For overall experience I would rate 3. For experiencing an Iconic Hotel in…",4,
"me and my girlfriend had just finished working in australia for 2 years. so we thought wed treat ourselves to a night in this hotel. we were greeted out the front by the doorman with ""im sorry to inform you but the infinity pool is closed for a week due to renovation"" our faces dropped as this was the main reason for paying that amount of money to stay here, luckily he then replied with ""im only joking, everythings open and you may check in early"" what a joker, pretty funny though. reception staff very helpful and professional. the room was amazing, the mini bar was fully stocked and loaded. most mini bars we see its just beer water and soft drinks. this one had your scotch's, vodkas, wines etc. the infinity pool on the roof was just unbelievable. the view....wow! unfortunatley…",5,
"Although a beautiful iconic hotel, the experience seemed 'clinical''. Staff from the check in to the pool - we noticed how none smiled/happy - it just felt business like with no enthusiasm.  The room - was large and beautiful decor, especially the bathroom. Great design. The pool - pictures/ brochures always show cream cushions on the sun lounges but none were laid out do the beds were hard rattan like. We previously stayed at the Rasa Sangri La, Sentosa Island and that deserves the 5 stars.",3,
"Stayed for a one night treat whilst visiting daughter. Check in was reasonably quick but felt a bit like an airport. Had booked a triple room and was suprised to find that the third bed was a put up bed squashed next to the main king size bed,  would have expected a proper bed for the price. Had to wait nearly an hour for our luggage to come to our room despite two phone calls to reception.  Views over Singapore  amazing and roof top pool a must. Probably the main reason to choose hotel over others.",5,
Came here with some friends just for the rooftop infinity pool. The view from the rooftop pool is amazing and makes a night at the hotel worth it. The hotel itself is nothing impressive. The hotel does have a mall with many dining options which makes it a one stop shop for many of your needs.,4,
"Stayed for a night. The infinity pool is beautiful at all times of the day. Best time to go is in the morning. Any other times it is super busy and it is hard finding a lounge chair.  The room we got was in Tower 3 and was really big, modern and clean. The lobby is quite busy and if your room is not ready there's no place to sit. The service at check-in and check-out was great outside that you do not feel special as there's just so many people around.  Apart from the pool there's no reason to really stay here. It is overpriced - there's plenty of other places at better value.",4,
"we stayed at the hotel for 5 days (4 nights) it is a mega hotel but organized fantastically! no queues we invited a car for pickup in the hotel we did not have to go through the reception as it was done privately in our rooms by a professional attendant. we ordered 2 interconnected rooms which were ready for us and the interconnecting door opened. we had clubs rooms so we had breakfast in the club lounge which was a full tasty breakfast wit a huge variety of delicious products. the club offers 5.00 p.m. cocktails with champagne other beverages a selection of canapés deserts etc. we came everyday as it was so good tasty well organized as well. there are many restaurants in the hotel or the annexed mall some of them (ku De Ta, Cuts) serve good food (though very expensive) others…",5,
"the service at this hotel is probably one of the worst I've ever experienced. Its like this place is so big they do not give a toss about any of the people staying there you are just another number.   The staff are rude and barely even talk to you its terrible for the price you pay to get treated like crap.  I had high hopes for this hotel to be amazing and me and my partner were disappointed to say the least. My family were all going to stay in October which I have now talked them out of it.   Stay at the W instead its worlds above this place! This hotel is fairly new and you can tell they just haven't got it right. We are lucky enough to stay in some amazing places around the world this has got to be one of the more stressful stays i've had anywhere, not relaxing in the…",2,
There is no question this a huge and very nice hotel but the real reason for staying here is for the pool. It is simply sensational. Although crowded we were always able to get a lounge and towel. I have never seen so many 'selfie sticks' being used in the one place.,4,
"right place to stay if you wanna spend your vacation .very helpful staff ,comfortable room and amenities I really enjoy my stay there .breakfast selection was very good and large . service was excellent.",4,
"It is a place which impact u. Even though the lobby is not wow, the view from the room, the amazing infinity pool at 57th floor are stunning. The food is good but nothing out of this world, the prices are exaggerate. An hotel which I want it so much too see, I am glad I did it, but to be honest you can easily do without!I've seen better for less.",4,
"We checked in at tower - 3 lobby .The check-in process can be improved . The hustle - bustle of the common lobby does not give a feel of a 5-star accommodation. Apart from that everything was wonderful... AWesome treatment , great city view from roon and a pool that takes the experience to another level. It was a comfortable and a great experience with family. Had a relaxing staycation here.",4,
"We only stayed for a brief moment of my birthday here. I was surprised when the receptionist mentioned that he upgraded our Deluxe Room to a Premier just because it's my birthday! My sister insisted to try this hotel before, but I am unsure since it's pricey. But considering that I always wants to try something new, that's why I booked for this hotel on my special day. We got the Bed and Breakfast combo. The next day while eating our breakfast buffet. The waiter sung a surprise Happy Birthday and gave me a cake for the celebration. I was astonish of course, but very happy. I couldn't imagine that I will be celebrating my birthday outside my country and greeted by very hospitable people on the hotel. You can say this is once in a lifetime experience indeed. I won't forget this…",5,
"My husband and I started our trip to Asia with a stop in Singapore. Since we were only staying for 2 nights we decided to stay here. It was the best decision! The room had a lot of space, it was cozy and the view of the city was amazing! The lobby is a work of art and the rooftop infinity pool is something everybody has to experience at least once and is only for hotel guests! We were able to relax and have a great start to our anniversary trip!  And bonus: Is within walking distance to many other attractions such as Clarke Quey!  Also, excellent service!",5,
"How can anyone give this place anything but an excellent review!  Staff were frendy and helpful, it's in a fantastic location, rooms and views are to die for and finally the pool is just amazing we found it not too busy at all and that was on a Saturday over Easter! We were upgraded to a suite which was the icing on the cake!  You will not be disappointed with this hotel!",5,
"Bought our tickets at our hotel and when we arrived had a job to find the entrance for the ride up to the observation terrace! Views were great, but when we came back down got lost in the maze of shopping malls. Took us ages to get out!",4,
"Certainly a modern iconic hotel with a design that includes the best in the world. The rooftop reflection swimming pool is a must for any visitor and draws crowds of visitors just to see it.  The rooftop bars and restaurants although not the cheapest (a colleague paid US $1,200 for a bottle of vodka) are legendary.  This is a place to impress be it business customers or a date.  The views are amazing.   I checked in at 1am and even then there were lines.  The checkin lines during the middle of the day were legendary. Glad I showed up at 1am and paid for the additional night.",5,
"The resort comprises 3 towers with a boat shaped 57th top floor containing an amazing ''sky park''  and magnificent infinity pool overlooking the city. Accommodation on floor 46 in Tower 3 where we stayed was spacious, well equipped and comfortable. One wall was glass  with a superb but vertiginous view across the Singapore River towards the city.   Although the hotel is enormous, service was slick and nothing was too much trouble. We generally were made to feel welcome and special wherever we went.  The hotel boasts a number of celebrity chef restaurants. There is a wide range of food available; something to please everyone whatever their ethnicity. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet which was the best we have encountered with an incredible range available. It…",5,
"Loved this hotel - very clean, good service, fantastic views & so close to gardens by the bay, great spot for nightly walks. Buffet in downstairs restaurant very pricy as 11 of us but found that the a la carte menu was a great solution - better prices, wonderful atmosphere - great service & quiet location.  The food court within the marina shops was always packed at dinner time, we could never get a seat. The pool was also very full but amazing views. We loved the fact that for $10 for the week we could hire an extra fridge in the room to store all our own items. ",5,
Massive lobby. Check in takes ages. Different lifts to access different floors. Rooms are spacious with mesmerizing city views and nightly light show if you facing the right way. Pool area is breathtaking at first sight but becomes frustrating when you can't find loungers together. Sometimes you can't find even a single lounger ... at 9pm! I understand that the public can access the pool area for a fee. This might explain the lack of space. Whatever the reason you feel like you in a public area and not a hotel with a focus on guest comfort.,3,
"We stayed here with two kids aged 12 and 9. We did come 'prepared' after reading quite a few reviews here commenting on the service, long wait and crowded lobby and pool. However, the whole stay was pretty good and enjoyable.   We arrived at 12 and expected the rooms to be not ready cos checked in time is 3pm. We were given our rooms straight away and the check in queue was only a 5-min wait. We got the connecting  rooms we asked for and we were upgraded to 46th floor (not sure abt the grade but much bigger than what we booked). The views were spectacular and the rooms were very clean and comfortable.   The pool was yes busy but most guests were only standing by the side to take pics. There were one adult section and two which kids were allowed. This was good cos my kids could…",5,
"Stayed two nights..room overlooking the Gardens By The Bay..fantastic. Room was very comfortable and well appointed. beware the minibar is on a sensor system..if you take something out to look at it it registers on your account! The rooftop pool area is spectacular as you'd imagine, just get there early in the day if you don't like crowds. Huge shopping centre and MRT are close by.I recommend to stay just to say you have stayed there. Plenty of eateries nearby if you don't want to pay the extra for buffet breakfast. Wi Fi worked just about everywhere. So as a once off experience do it.",4,
"By now, you know everything about the hotel. It's pool, it's celebrity chef restaurants, it's mall and casino and it's architect. It's truly wonderful. Just remember not to visit on holiday seasons since that means 2 hr check-in lines and breakfast queue that span the entire lobby, and trust me that lobby is huge.  Surprised to find public facilities (bathrooms, lift lobby) to be rather filthy, especially when you're customed to the Macau casino resorts.  Take a walk by the boardwalk at night, it's rather relaxing.",5,
"The inifinity pool does not disappoint.  There is also an adults only section of the pool.  It was much longer than we had realized.  The rooms were great: clean and comfortable.  They allowed us an early check-in with no additional fees, which was great.  Only things that I'd like to point out is that we had a shared balcony, which made us not want to use it.  There was also no furniture on the balcony.  Since we were on a low floor in building 1, we could hear all the noise coming from the lobby/restaurant on the main floor.  If possible, get on a higher floor on building 1.  I'm not sure what buliding 2/3 were like, but I know it's only building 1 that overlooks the restaurant and main lobby.  Our safe was broken and when we called the concierge, they were quick to action it.…",4,
"We liked the big room with spectacular view to both sides: city and ocean. Of course, the infinty pool is THE highlight, afternoon tea on 55th floor very nice, breakfast at RISE has a wide variety.  Very special thanks to Mr. Param / Bell for his very friendly and successful support!!!!",5,
"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at the Marina Bay Sands, last step of our long trip. we were disappointed upon our arrival by the crowded lobbie and long wait to check in. The room was ok, and the pool awesome, it worth it!!",3,
"We come to Marina Bay Sands every year for 1 week, to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. We love this hotel for a whole lot of reasons but if you are looking for a cheap holiday then it is probably best to by pass Singapore altogether. I would suggest spending a little extra and going for a Club suite, as it includes access to The Club on level 55. You will get a complimentary, breakfast (incredible), afternoon tea and Cocktail and Canapes (again incredible, great food and very fine wines, champagne and high-end spirits). The Pool area is unbelievable with a 360 degree view of the City and Bay areas. It can get a little busy at times though. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafes within the entire complex to cater for all budgets. The rooms/suites have ample room with…",5,
"Booked this hotel for a special trip with the family. Yes it's expensive - but totally worth it. Ask for a city room - much more to see than the sea view. We got a lovely spacious room with superb views. They have a light show over the marina at 8pm and 9pm which is lovely. But for me it was still all about the pool!! You cannot describe how amazing it is. Pictures don't do it justice - it's worth every penny! Singapore is a great city and the river cruise from outside the hotel is great too. Would recommend a meal at Boat Quay, the restaurants in the adjoining mall from the hotel are pricy.  Do yourself a favor and stay here if you can. ",5,
"This hotel is somewhere you need to stay at at least once.  Simply noticing it on the drive in from the airport is an experience in itself (particularly for first time visitors to Singapore).  Like many reviewers have commented, the highlight / attraction is the infinity pool on the roof deck, which can get crowded, but was actually better than I expected when we went up there.  Swimming in the pool with the panoramic views of the Singapore sky-line is fantastic - though I do personally think the ""view of"" the three tower structure from afar is actually better than the ""view from"" the top of the building.  The rooms themselves, while pricey, are really well set out and spacious, with good bedding and bath facilities, and good views (obviously, the higher up, the better view). …",4,
this was an excellent hotel with fantastic service and stunning breakfast menu . The infinity pool and hot tub spa area is an experience of a life time that can be  shared with your grandchildren . This is a must for every traveller !,5,
You could hang out at the pool all day taking in the views. The whole setup is luxury. Easy access to food courts and shopping malls underneath hotel and there is a casino. The gym in the hotel also pretty cool/,5,
"Excellent quality hotel. It's huge so don't expect intimacy, but it offers so much else. Great place to stay as it close to restaurants & malls, plus the sight seeing bus stops right outside. Our room was large and comfortable with a great view of the sea. The pool is like nothing I've experienced and the view from the edge is amazing. Its a selfie paradise. Its also a great place to watch the sunrise (thanks jet lag!). Not cheap to eat and drink but its a top hotel. All staff I dealt with were nice & friendly.",5,
"My husband and I booked a 2 night stay at the Marina Bay Sands for the last part of our Singapore trip, we mostly booked the hotel for its incredible infinity pool, at £470 for the 2 nights on a room only rate in their standard room we were expecting something pretty special unfortunately we got anything but.  Let me start with the positives, the room was spacious, and well laid out. The infinity pool is amazing but over crowded so keep this in mind, the hotel looks amazing   Now for the not so good.   Checking in to the hotel is awful it's like an airport style where you need to wait in lines, this took quite sometime. We were eventually brought over to the vip section to check in which made no difference in waiting time, and the staff were quite unfriendly. Not the warm…",1,
"I just stayed here for one night, and the main reason was off course the Infinite Pool at the SkyPark. And it was totally worth it! The Pool is just amazing. It really looks like it is hovering over the skyline of SIN. Awesome! I booked the cheapest room at the MBS but even that one was fascinating, and offered me a breathtaking view on the Gardens by the Bay!  All in all it is obviously one of the most impressive Hotels in the world! And as a Backpacker who is traveling through, it is nice to check in for one night but no more. And everybody has to decide for themselves if they want to spend so much money only for the possibility to take a swim in one of the greatest pools of the world.",4,
Let me start by saying that any attempt to score based on value for money is futile - we all have pockets of different lengths & we all choose to spend our money in different ways - so let's rate the experience - the infinity pool is of course out of this world - it can get busy but there is a seperate 'adults only' bit which is great for those that  don't want to be disturbed - however you are more likely to be bothered by other people's selfie sticks!  The staff are plentiful & attentive for a  large hotel - breakfast is entertainment in itself - such a wide choice - had a great chat with one of the managers  who told us a lot about the workings of the place - view from the room superb - bed super comfy - then put in an extra bed for our daughter with minimal fuss - altogether…,5,
"I have never stayed anywhere like this. This hotel (the 'boat building') was on my bucket list, mainly because I wanted to swim in the pool. I was not disappointed. A few times I stood by the elevators just so I could watch people's faces as they stepped out and saw the view. (I have never seen so many selfie sticks in a pool in my life.) A night at this hotel is pricey but the service is outstanding, the views are astonishing (both sides of the hotel) and architecturally the whole is fascinating.  The rooms were very well appointed. While the city views are just lovely, especially at night, the harbour views are better than average and give you the sunrise. The bed was vast and comfortable with truly perfect pillows and towel 'origami' as a quirky touch. the bathroom was a…",5,

"I stayed here by myself in January 2015 and I booked the Club room with city view.  I arrived at Tower 1 by taxi and was greeted and escorted towards the Club/Suite check in counter despite the line up and not evening mentioning if I had a reservation, the staff member escorting me even removed some bollard ropes for a more direct walk towards the counter.  Odd, but pretty cool.  The check in staff member was prompt and polite, I was given a couple bottles of water which was much appreciated after my flight from Australia.  The check in staff member took the time to explain the inclusions with my booking and provided me with a map and a few suggestions of places to check out.  The room I was allocated was 4950 in Tower 2, this room is amazing, it is only a few doors down from…",5,
"You're unlikely to be called by name or remembered by staff at this huge casino-retail-hotel complex.  However the views and the iconic rooftop pool make this place a unique experience.  Hotel guests can access the pool easily by heading to the 57th floor.  Towels of course are provided.  A Haagen-Daas ice cream bar will cost you $S10.  Surprising there are few meal options after 22:00 (when we arrived) so we opted for a fairly ordinary club sandwich and hamburger, both with hot chips for around $S30 each.  Not great value.  The rooms still feel new after 5 years and are spacious with large bathrooms.  Sadly for such a tremendous engineering feat the finishes are substandard.  It looks as though it was completed I a hurry.    The concierge staff are very helpful, the free wifi…",3,

"One of the reasons I booked a trip to Singapore was to swim in the infinity pool on the roof and also because I love architecturally interesting buildings. I would say that the room was what I expected (clean, well appointed, etc.) of a hotel of this sort but not outstanding in any other way. You could get a similar room in Las Vegas for half the price but they won't have the fantastic skypark on the roof. That's what makes it worth it to stay here at least once. Another good reason is its proximity to Gardens By the Bay, the Waterfront Promenade, and the Singapore Flyer.  The prices for food at the hotel restaurant are very high therefore we ate breakfast at The Sweet Spot on the ground floor near tower 3. They have delicious coffees and bakery items. Food in Singapore in…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands  Staying here was meant to be the icing on the cake.   After shouting my sister a trip to Singapore, I thought staying here at the end would be the perfect end to the trip.    I paid approx $2000 for 3 nights (1 room for my sister, my wife & I to share).   We were lucky that although I often saw a long check-in line (so be prepared for a long wait at check-in), it wasn't too long when we checked in. Although the man who checked us in failed to confirm the bedding arrangement in our room, which caused a later issue.  I was disappointed when he told us we were getting a rear facing room on just level 8 (I had requested a high up room).

"We stayed here with my husband for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon.  Pros:  - The pool is great. It really is worth seeing and experiencing in person. - The staff are polite and friendly. Always efficient. - The bedding was very comfortable, the mattress and pillows were lovely and contributed to a good night's sleep. - The food we ordered in room service was nice. The hotel also readily accommodated our request for an earlier breakfast (5.30) because we had already prepaid it and needed to fly out early. - When there was a bathroom problem, a plumber came and fixed everything very efficiently.  Cons:  - The pool can get really crowded and most people seem to only come to take selfies. Also, personally I found the water was too cold. Kids are very often found in the adult-only…",4,
"We chose here for one reason. The pool.  The price was a lot higher than what we would usually pay at 550sd per night - but it's our little treat in Singapore and this was our 3rd stay.  Pros: the rooms are spacious, the views of the city from the rooms is amazing, the housekeeping is immaculate, the pool is spectacular.    Cons: it's not right amongst the action, the area sorrounding is quite pricey, service seems to have dropped somewhat.  This time around the service and our general stay seemed to be lacking what we found so charming the first two times round.   When we checked in there were 3 of us and the check in agent asked if we wanted a roll away- we said no, knowing the Sofa would fold out. When we got to our room; we rang housekeeping to ask for the couch to be made…",4,
"We were at MBS only for a night. Check in was efficient and fast. Bellboy service was on top of their game, always on their toes. Bellboy gave us his card and even showed us around the room and how to function the buttons in the room - first time experience and it was excellent. We had room service for breakfast at 10am and it came on point. The lady that served us was polite and nice yet professional. Calling for a bellboy to get our bags to the lobby was very efficient - again on top of their game. What I liked about room service or bellboys are that they have this system where someone elsewhere would ring our room and once we've opened the door, the bellboy/room service would inform the caller that we have opened the door. To me that was pretty cool. Presence known! We didn't…",5,
Recently stayed here for 3 nights with my partner in march and the service from start to finish was of the highest class. Got an upgrade on arrival can't complain and the pool what a great spot to have a few drinks and enjoy the view. Ate out at some celebrity restaurants which were so good and good vibes. Also went to theatre which was a good show and had a bit of a win in the casino before we left so overall great experience ,4,
"One of the best hotels in Singapore. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful (check-out, card problems etc).  Pool, sauna and steam bath were great!   Wi-fi was a bit slow and you can use it only for 3 devices.. it was not convenient as I had with me 2 laptops and 3 phones.",5,
"Rooms are big and relatively clean. Ocean views are decent. Club floor service is good, so is the food. The rooftop infinity pool is of course the highlight of the property.  The attached shopping and dining areas make it extremely easy for you to only stay on the property without having to venture out, should you choose to do so. There are plenty of shopping and dining options for most budgets.  Location is a little way off the usual tourist spots, however there are free shuttles.",4,
"We stayed for three days. The place was crowded, and it took us 20 minutes to be check-in. The front desk are poorly trained. When we got to the room the fridge was flooding and there were no coffee or tea bags to be had! The surroundings to the pool were dirty and piled high with used damp towels. This is not a five star hotel. We would not go back.",3,
"This is my second stay in the hotel. Checked in on April 4th 2015. The check in took over 30 minutes. For a hotel with over 2500 rooms they need to have more checkin counters. We were booked in the Premier rooms (1885 tower 1) and got a room facing the gardens and had a balcony. Awesome room, great view and a huge room. The bed was extremely comfortable. Be careful with the mini bar, it is automatically billed even if you take the item out to check it out and don't consume it.   The infinity pool on the 57th floor (roof deck) is an awesome experience. we used the pool at night and also early evening. Loved it. But don't expect any kind of service to order food or drinks. It was difficult to find anyone to take your order and when they do come they are in a hurry to get away.…",4,
"We stayed here to celebrate our 3oth Wedding Anniversary. We arrived well before check in time, not a problem, we were ushered directly to the VIP Check in and five minutes later we entered our suite on the 41st floor (Tower 2). WOW is an understatement, the room was spacious and immaculate. We had a massive comfortable King Bed and very swish bathroom. What made it fantastic was the amazing view we had over the ""Gardens by the Bay"" and the ocean. The room was gorgeous but going up to the 57th floor to swim in the pool with a view was up there as one of the most awesome things ever. Especially swimming at night with the most incredible view over the Singapore city, just mind blowing. I had heard it was sensational but to experience it was truly unforgettable. We also had the…",5,
"Stayed in 47th floor with a great view of the bay, the room was 57 sqm so it was more than enough space for us to not bump into eachother in the living room or the bathroom. The room had massive floor to ceiling windows with a view of the bay and Singapore city centre.  The checkin was a bit slow and the queue was long, but later realized that there was a check-in area in tower 3 too that we probably could have used. However, taken into considerations the size of the hotel and the number of rooms it was not too bad. The reception staff was very friendly and professional.  The pool was a bit crowded, but being one of the highest regarded attractions in Singapore this is probably something you just have to expect. Very nice place to relax when you get a place to lie down.  Went…",4,
"This is a must visit even if it is for only one night. The higher the room the better the view. The infinity pool is something to experience.  The only negative I can think of is that check in is in the mall, this does not give you the feeling of exclusivity.  It feel as if you stand in a queue to buy movie tickets. That aside, still a great hotel. ",5,
"great location, great room, bed and amazing pool. This is what makes this hotel so iconic. its greatness sometime risks to be its weak side too staff can be so professional but can be also so careless, both at the reception and at the restaurant Pool can be so amazing, but at the same time can risk to be a ""public"" pool with so many guests from outside packing the place already packed with hotel guest  I got a special reduced price, I heard people paying 700$ per night. Surely the above doesn't match that price (if you consider the exclusive luxury feeling there are other hotels with more).  Overall a good experience and amazing pictures.",4,
"Amazing experience, stunning hotel, must stay here just to visit the Infinity pool up top which is exclusively for guests of the hotel, a visit to the pool is worth the price of a room.  The rooms are of two types one that have balconies and face the Gardens by the Bay and out to the Sea and the rooms without balconies and face the Central Business District. Generally rooms facing the Gardens by the Bay are cheaper, starting at around S$450 and up and from my experience they will place you in Tower 1, rooms facing the Centeral Business District the Downtown Core start at over S$500 and up. you can book online and they keep having promotions depending on the time of month and if their are any important holidays coming up such as Chinese New Years, be ready to pay higher rates at…",4,
"Our flight arrived early morning 6am.  The receptionist was kind enough for us to check in early at 8am without extra cost.  I had experience where I have to pay extra to check in early even if the rooms are ready.  The room had great view of the Bay Area, request for higher level to ensure better view.  The room itself is quite spacious and clean. Bed was comfy too.  The pool was packed with people as expected but great view!  We used the sauna and hot pool next to the gym which was great too.  Didn't get the chance to use the gym but it looked nicely equipped too.    It is pricy but I think it is one of the hotels that you have stay at least once in your life.",4,
"Stayed here on the final leg of our 2 centre holiday - and WOW! We had room 4910 on the 49th floor overlooking the gardens and bay. Stunning views. The room was extremely large, en suite shower room, loads of storage and best of all - a balcony! That was totally unexpected but how nice to actually step out for the full impact (it is only big enough to stand on & needed a brave pill beforehand!) Breakfast is in the Rise Restaurant in the lobby area. High standard of food & choice and very well organised. We had a family celebration lunch here too which is an all you can eat buffet. The big selling point with MBS is of course the rooftop infinity pool. First impressions will stay with us forever. The pool itself is not deep so cameras can be taken in safely for all the stunning…",5,
We had been recommended by friends to stay at Marina Bay but having seen the hotel on a previous Singapore visit we needed no persuading. On arrival we were upgraded to a club room overlooking the Garden on the Bay on the 49th floor so had a grand stand view of the light display of the super trees in the evening. The roof top pool has many recommendations - largest - highest etc. But for us it was the service from the staff which was second to none and the whole hotel and Marina Bay area is unique and so special. If you want a to be wowed this is the hotel to go to. If you want a quiet intimate vacation this is not for you as it is a constant moving of humanity through the lobby and public areas as all are in awe of the building.,5,
"Spent Easter weekend here with my family (children 8 & 13).  As expats living in Singapore, we rarely stay anywhere in the city, but the holiday weekend was an opportunity to ""get away"" for some family time.  We stayed in a Club Room on the 40th floor with a beautiful view of the city.  The highlight of the stay, of course, was the Sands Skypark and infinity pool on the 57th story.  Pictures simply do not do it justice; you have to experience it for yourself. We found the service staff to be very good to excellent, especially in The Club restaurant on the 55th floor.  Naveen and Ramona were particular stand-outs, very friendly and accommodating, helping us work with the chefs to prepare food for our son who is allergic to egg, dairy and nut products.  In-room dining was…",4,
"This hotel is just amazing, you just have to stay here. The room was gorgeous, the bed amazing and the view beautiful.  A wonderful place to end our holiday. We couldn't get out of the pool, hanging over the edge of this amazing building watching life go by.",5,
"We booked a city view room but some how there was an error with our booking so the upgraded us to the orchid sweet, the room was immaculate and super large, hotel service was very attentive and the infinity pool was amazing! loved every moment, and it was only a short trip from the airport. We were only in SG for a couple of days but it was a couple of days well spent, i would recommend this hotel to anyone in SG for only a short time and wants to take in all the beautiful sights",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is amazing! We had a premium city view room on the 41st floor - the room was massive and the view, wow! We stayed there for our 10 year wedding anniversary and even before they found that out, the staff went out of their way to make our stay one of the most enjoyable holidays we have ever had. We got a free upgrade to the Club Room where you got complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapés in the evening. The food was so beautiful and as it was a serve yourself set up we made this our dinner both nights! Saved us on breakfast too! I can't say enough about the staff, from the front service desk, to the man who delivered our bags, and to the club room staff who gave us thoughtful little gifts. They are all so friendly! The pool of course speaks…",5,
I really enjoy my staying at this hotel.. they give time for swimmers in the morning (06.00-08.00) to exercise in the proper distance.. not just enjoying the scenery from the pool..no more good comments from the service.. facilities.. food.. hotel amenities.. all are excellent..,5,
"I would like to highly recommend people to stay 1 night in this hotel in exprience such a large luxury hotel. Especially  infinity pool is really fantastic. I really enjoyed it. View from the pool is amazing and you could feel that you are on the Sky.  However 1 night should be more than enough. Because rate is too high. Pool is more than perfect but room is so so nothing speical actually. Service is just avarage. Not luxury class service.  Front desk was always busy due to high Occupancy maybe. That's why? may be staffs look very busy and not much smiling.  Bar at the lobby is okay. Just okay...  Only 1 thing I really like is infinity pool and a lot of luxury shops for shopping.  This is the very tipical hotel in Singapore. So If you visit, I would like to recommend you to stay…",4,
We are staying in a garden view room on the 50th floor for 2 nights prior to embarking on the Ocean Princess for 32 days to South Africa.  We hooked what seems to be a bargain rate via orbitz as we completed our flight details.  I think the garden view from this vantage beats the city view.  I guess we arrived at a good time - about 6pm and no lines at the check in.  We crashed immediately as we had been in airplanes and airports for over 40 hours. In the morning we ordered room service breakfast.  Was wheeled in on a cart that makes into a table.  Hot food retrieved from the under-table oven.  Linen service bedside.  Swam in the infinity pool  No problem getting a lounger.  Picked up a complementary newspaper at the towel concierge.   Then we roamed the Bayside gardens after…,5,
"Have you ever had the experience of walking past a bakery and there in the window is the most delicious looking cake you've ever seen? It's large, it's icing is glossy and tempting and the cherry on the top is huge and sparkles in the sunlight? You buy it and take it home, only to discover that the Glacé cherry is ok but the icing is crusty and the bun is dry and you bin half of it?  To me, that sums up the Marina Bay Sands. That iconic pool is one of the greatest marketing tools of all time and does actually live up to the hype, but everything below it, whilst perfectly adequate, is nowhere near the level one should expect for these rates.  I believe that the difference between a good hotel and a great one is in the detail, not just facilities. It's why a small private hotel…",3,
"The actual hotel room was pretty standard - similar to any Hyatt, Marriott or Hilton. Basically  you're paying for the rooftop pool. Not sure I would pay $400+ per night to stay there again. Join the Sands Rewards Lifestyle Program before you check in (they have booths in the mall adjacent to the hotel). You then get free high speed internet in the hotel and discounts at various restaurants.",4,
"An incredible hotel, a must see destination for any visitor to Singapore.We only walked around the huge lobby area, did some shopping in the amazing mall, and went up to the roof top for cocktails. The afternoon tea looked wonderful too.",5,
"it was a real privilege to stay here and I loved my stay. The people were all very friendly, the room was immaculate and the bed and bath were both luxuriously comfortable. It is the iconic building in Singapore and possibly South East Asia (barring the Petronas towers) and taking the lift up to the 57th floor only compounds this fact. A breathtaking and exclusive view of the city skyline rises out of the very pool that you can swim in. It is an unbelievable experience. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to stay here, do!",5,
"I’ll admit, I booked this hotel to get access to the rooftop pool and I’m so glad I did.  The Marina Bay Sands resort is modeled just like a hotel in Vegas – huge, busy, fancy, anything you can want under one roof.   The lines to check in were pretty long, but as expected it was around Christmas and as previously stated, a huge hotel.   We upgraded to a club room and shot from the 7th to the 47th floor with club access.  Well worth it.  The views from the top were amazing.  We faced the water side and had a great bird’s eye view of the Gardens by the Bay.  The room was very spacious, clean and quiet.  The bathtub was huge.  If you ask for some bath salts, be prepared for your own mini spa. Unfortunately, the weather called for thunderstorms, so we didn’t get any rays at the…",5,
"We booked two nights at Marina Bay Sands as we definitely wanted to experience that out-this-world swimming pool... and it didn't disappoint. The room (facing the city) was beautiful. Spacious, very confortable beds (even the rollaway, which had a very comfortable mattress), and a HUGE bathroom. The only thing I didn't like is that you couldn't use the minifridge for your own drinks and had to rent an extra one for 10 dollars. Considering the price of the room, you would expect to be able to use the fridge! The swimming pool was even more amazing than we expected. You just can't help staring at the skyline (and at the people taking selfies. A real show!). We never had any problem finding a good spot. Towel service was excellent. However, there could be more bathrooms. The water…",5,
"This is a great place to visit, the views are amazing. No need to pay to go to the top which is about 46 dollars for two , go up to the  hotel bar for free and sit in the roof top bar with a lovely jug of sangria which cost about 42 dollars.  Well worth it view fantastic you could even have your lunch there if feeling very decadent.",5,
"We travelled through Singapore on our way back from a trip to Europe. From the taxi the hotel looked so impressive and expansive. Check in was simple and we were given an upgrade on arrival. The room was excellent and the views second to none. We tried the infinity pool on the roof both during the day and evening when the lights were beginning to illuminate the city, it was a great experience. The staff were all wonderful and the many restaurants and bars were enough for anyone to enjoy. We stayed for three days and the location was just right a short walk to the subway where you can travel easily to any part of the city you desire. All in all an excellent hotel and I would rush back next time I visit Singapore .",5,
"We booked two rooms for one night before embarking on our SE Asia cruise.  The Good - SkyPark was absolutely amazing! Best roof-top pool in the world as far as I am concerned, and unbeatable view of Singapore. A bit windy and cold if you are from warm climate, but did not dampen thing the slightest for those of us escaping from winter at home. The wide range of restaurants and shops in the malls are interesting as well.  The Alright - The facilities aim to impress, and on some measures were successful. The staff did try hard to be helpful, but they were very busy with such big number of guests. The check-in queues were long, especially if you don't have status. Automated check-out kiosks helped.  The Bad - One of our rooms was ""upgraded"" to big sea view club room on a low floor.…",3,
"Marina Bay Sands is without a doubt one of the most famous landmark buildings in Singapore. So, yes, rooms in this magnificent building are very expensive. You pay for the unique location, the beautiful views, the incredible infinity pool and the impeccable trained staff.  Often heard complaints are that the hotel is too busy. While this is certainly true (at any given moment of the day the lobby and pool are bustling with people), during my stay this really never bothered me. I always found a free spot at the pool, did not have to wait long at check-in nor at check-out and we always got seated at breakfast in less than five minutes. Marina Bay Sands is huge, so it's quite normal that you have a lot of people everywhere. If you're looking for a quiet place, I recommend you book…",5,
Not the cheapest place in town but the sheer size and quality is overwhelming. The lobby is always full and vibrant. The staff could not be more helpful. The rooms are so - well  - roomy. The only criticism I had was that as an Australian I could not watch the Cricket World Cup final on TV.,5,
"We spent one night at this hotel but apart from the views from the higher rooms and the infinity pool it was a disappointment. There is no doubt that staying at this hotel is an experience but be prepared to pay for it. One night at this hotel cost us more than four nights at another five star hotel in Singapore which, we felt had more style and a better ambience. We chose to eat in one of the in house restaurants (Rise) for dinner and the set price for the buffet was pretty high but the food was plentiful and various. However the prices charged for drinks ( S$95 ++ for a standard bottle of red) made the meal very expensive. Breakfast was taken at the same location and of a buffet style. However, the restaurant claims to have seating for over 500 persons and guests were queuing…",3,
I booked a club room as a special stop over for my wifes birthday. I had requested a city view on a high floor. First impressions are that if you are arriving early tell the hotel so they are prepared as its crazy busy until early afternoon with people checking out.. If you want the special treatment then dont arrive at 11am and expect to be checked in...Having said that we arrived in the middle of crazy hour just after midday and the premium service check in team started to make us feel welcome. After checking in a member of the team came to reception to escort us to the room. We found we had been upgraded without asking - a very nice suprise. My dinner reservation had also been confirmed and a bottle of champagne was presented as a gift to my wife. The room itself - Orchid…,5,
"We had a wonderful suite with spectacular views from the en-suite over the water & ships waiting to dock, and over the bay from the bedroom & lounge room areas. We stayed here like most people probably do because it is iconic and the infinity pool is world famous.   What can I say about the Marina Bay Sands that have not been said?",4,
"Words are just not enough to do justice to express the feel one gets after having a glance at the iconic building that stands in front of you . the river flowing at one end and beautifully presented colourful trees gives the whole place a mind blowing feel. The big building comprises of three towers which are joined by a large top which gives it a very majestic look. No matter how many times you look at it, you are bound to say wow again and again. I am surprised as to why it's not one of the new wonders of the present day and age. Hats off to the team who was involved in the project.",5,
"We visited this hotel for one night last year before embarking on a cruise. Upon check in, the reception staff wouldn't accept a cash deposit. We then paid by credit card, settled dinner ourselves and then checked out the next day. Later we realised the deposit hadn't been returned. Called, was told it would be returned, and the money still hasn't reached the account. Appalling.  Hotel was fine, nothing too exciting, however their dishonesty would put me off returning.",1,
The experience of staying at Marina Bay Sands was good considering the easy access to Marina Bay area. The hotel staff was really helpful and it was and it was a good experience. But the wow factor was missing because of which I was a bit disappointed. But overall a good experience.,4,
"The stay overall was okay.  I guess I was just expecting a little bit more for a very iconic place. Unfortunately the first night we were there, there was a cockroach in our bedroom, while we understand this might happen - its just a let down.  We were travelling as a group of 3 girls, and we discovered that one of the bed linen was stained with menstrual blood, when the girl occupying the bed was not menstruating. Then the mix up with the card , we stayed for three nights but one of our friends left early, and admittedly this also mean that the stay was also under 2 bookings.  We clarify that on the first day, and they helpfully gave us the same room so we can stay the whole  three nights on the same room, however on the 3rd day, our cards stopped working and it took 3 visits…",4,
"I got here with my wife and decided to have a good look of Singapore from the top floor of Marina Bay. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to explore all area of Marina Bay Sands, but we did get to the top floor club, sip a nice tea, and enjoy the view.  If you plan to see the view of Singapore, you better come here at night. ",4,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights in a deluxe city view room. Before booking we had read many of he other reviews so we're pre prepared for some issues along the way but we were very pleasantly surprised.  Arrival at the hotel is a strange experience. The towers each have there own entrance and checkin area, which is good because it means you arrive near your tower. It is slightly strange however as the entrances also access some of the shops so can lead to confusion. This results in a little bit of a hit or miss arrival and standard by the bell desk meaning some had there luggage taken at the door and some did not. The reception desk is also not completely obvious to begin with, but do not be deterred just keep walking in and you will find it. We arrived at about 7pm…",4,
"everything perfect, if you going Singapore holiday, marina bay sands is first choice hotel.top roof swimming pool not comparable with anywhere else. the staff was friendly and smile allays.the location is in heart of tourist  zone.",5,
"We stayed here for 3 nights. Had a deluxe room with city views, and were up on 47th floor - so the view was sensational! The room itself was so big we were immensely impressed upon entry. All decor and furnishings were in great condition. Loved the quirky sliding door for the bathroom.   Was a bit of a 'not 5* arrival' - had to get our own luggage out and tow it through the shops/lobby, and then on to our room. Especially as it wasn't busy checking in. The check in area for the hotel isn't labelled, nearly walked straight past it.   Only other concern was the sky pool. It was a most amazing experience, however, think each individual staying at the hotel should have a 'pool towel card' (we've seen this system work a treat in other hotels.) the pool was very busy, but most people…",4,
"Stayed for 2 nights in that outstanding hotel. I was reading many reviews before and even my travel agent told me, not to expect friendly stuff. I got pleasantly surprised. Checking in was fast and the stuff was really friendly. We got an upgrade from a Deluxe Room to a Suite in the 53. floor. That Suite was great and had a breathtaking view. The Infinity Pool was amazing,not that overcrowded like expected. Breakfast was just outstanding. A big selection of everything.The stuff was very friendly. I just liked everything about this hotel. Checking out was also fast and very friendly. I wish i could stay longer, but certainly was not my last visit .",5,
"I stayed at MBS for a period of three nights. I would recommend people to book more than one night, because from 11am until 3pm, which is in between check-out and check-in time, the pool is comparatively empty to other times. Our assumption was that most people book for only one night. Overall the room was somewhat of an anti-climax, as were expecting something a little more from our Premium Room, but this is most certainly something subjective. The view from the balcony of the gardens was lovely, albeit spoilt a little bit by the restricted view due to the building's architecture.  During our honeymoon stay, we stayed in three hotels, and MBS was the only hotel not to acknowledge our honeymoon. Not a single ""congratulations"", or anything. In the previous two hotels (Parkroyal…",4,
I had stayed to this wonderfull hotel in june 2011 this is heaven on earth it is not 5* it is 10* hotel in service and maintainance all rooms are wonderfull  the hotel has very good casino and shopping mall really enjoyed a lot,5,
"It was my third trip to my favorite hotel - MBS Unfortunately I was disappointed this time. We booked room for three of us. Room was not ready at all. I have to ask for everything  -  3rd cup,  spoon, bathrobe,  including 3rd bed. One particular  room service worker  was rood. But people at  service desk were really nice and helpful. Aircon was broken. It was repaired  promptly after my request. I believe that rooms  at The Tower 1 is smaller and service is not as good as in the Tower 3 . Still happy to come back !",4,
The reason I stayed at this hotel was because of the pool and it didn't disappoint. It was busy and a lot of people were taking selfies but I liked that they had an adults only section of the pool. I had a garden view room and I liked the view. The room itself was nice but I found the Fairmont Singapore room to be nicer. Because it is a big hotel it is very busy. On checking in I had to wait quite a while but a lady ended up taking me to the VIP area to check in to help with the long lines. The gym was great but it needs a stretching area. I was disappointed with the service at the Day Spa and wished that the chocolate and cheese buffet had longer hours as I really wanted to try it but did not have the time. The shops and train station are all downstairs so very handy.,5,
"The Hotel is a really large one, the 3 towers, so there are always few things you will not get which you may expect from a hotel as big as this.  1. Don't expect a very personal experience, Check-in, check-out can take long.  2. The views are great if you can get a city facing view beyond the 22nd floor. 3. The Infiniti pool is the highlight, and it really is quite worth it.  4. There is enough to do, even though you land up early in the city, they do give you an access card to go to the pool. which was nice of them. 5. Accessibility from the MRT is fantastic.   Overall a good experience, but short of fantastic I would say.",4,
"This is the second time I have stayed at MBS and also for 4 nights.  Thankfully, check in was quicker this time.  We were attending an event happening at the Expo & Convention center so location was ideal.  The positives: * Proximity to Gardens by the Bay and River Walk * Very Spacious Lobby * Friendly check in and Concierge Staff * Spacious / clean hotel room / bathroom on 49th floor overlooking Bay * Lots of restaurant / bar option at hotel and across the MBS Shoppes * Continued Access to hotel facilities (except pool) once you have checked out and waiting for your time to head to the airport * Great Shower / steam room, hot pool facilities / amenities next to the hotel gym * Good little cafe ""the sweet spot"" in lobby area for coffee and pastries in the morning * Good wifi…",4,
"Yes it has an amazing swimming pool on the roof top ,yes the building look totally futuristic ,the complex is in top of a huge casino and shopping mall .... But the feeling and the experience is very much lacking personal touch . The lobby feel like a huge air port terminal with no seat to be found and hundreds of 'non guest' wanderers walking around , the breakfast ( which has great food as you expect ) served with in this strange lobby space in a designated aria and the experience is not relaxing, I first got a standard room which was really badly maintained to start with , broken air conditioning stains to name a few .... I had to address it and I was moved to a huge apartment that was amazing  if I had 10 other people to invite .... All in all overrated as a hotel stay.I…",4,
"A dive in between clouds & skyscrapers is the highlight & lifetime experience at Infinity Pool. Starting from Lobby till Infinity Pool the hotel is a piece of marvellous architecture yet comfortable & well guided. Rooms are comfortable with breathtaking views, we choose garden view which suppose to be best view specially at night of Garden By The Bay. Food is good liked the breakfast buffet spread. Vegetarian options were available for food. Apart from relaxing at balcony sipping sgsling there's lot more in hotel to discover & enjoy. Entertainment zone, Shopping, Casino, Bars, Restaurants, Spa all in one place!! Would recommend to stay longer then a day as lots to discover... Overall good hospitality. Fast check in & check outs. Helpful staff.",5,
"stayed with family for 3 nights in February 2013. Very new, great facilities, convenient, massive room (paid upgrade to city view) with two huge twin beds. Kids enjoyed the pool but very busy!! Eat at the top floor restaurant but didn't try breakfast. The is however, a massive casino hotel without any personal service but good if you want anonymity. Check in desk are well trained to sell you upgrades, be prepared!",4,
"Wow, wow and wow!  This is the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in.  The staff bend over backwards for you and are so friendly and helpful.  We were celebrating our anniversary and Cheryl at the check in desk upgraded us to a suite.  The room was spectacular and the views were astounding.  When you walk out onto the pool area you just can't help but smile  it's AWESOME !!!  Everyone had a smile on their face.  Well done Marina Bay Sands - Perfection!!!",5,
"My boyfriend and I stayed in a 'Club Room' on the 39th floor in Tower 3 for 2 nights. We had originally booked to stay in a 'Premier Room' but much to our delight, we received a free upgrade upon checking in! The room was absolutely spectacular with beautiful views of the Singapore skyline through floor to ceiling windows - blissful! The sky park/infinity pool is as awe inspiring as you would expect and is completely one of a kind. As mentioned in below reviews, the pool area can get a little crowded but at 150 m in length, there is more than enough room for everyone. The views from the pool are breathtaking and we found that certain times of day at the pool were quieter than others e.g. between 11 am and 3 pm (the period between check-in and check-out). I would also highly…",5,
"Opted to spend our very first night in Singas here. Rooms spacious, we had Tower 2, floor 44 with views if the bay which I preferred as the Bay Gardens are beautiful in the evening.  Overall amazing experience! Roof too bar had plenty attentive pool staff on hand to find beds, offer towels & take drinks, snacks orders. Music great & chilled atmosphere around sky pool.   Rooms very spacious. Staff very helpful.   Upon check in we were given a complimentary late check till 2pm out the following day.    Overall an excellent experience if only to chill round the infinity pool.   Added extras such as bottle champagne & chocolate covered strawberries in our room for our wedding anniversary.   Big thanks to all staff :) first class   Music chilled ",5,
Stayed in a room on the 37th floor with husband and 2 kids (8yrs and 4 yrs).  We all loved the room and the hotel but most of all we loved the roof top infinity pool.  My 8 year old son thought it was the highlight of our trip.  We all stayed in the one room.  A large king bed and sofa bed that the kids shared.  Perfect for the one night as a stop over on the way back to Australia.    The kids enjoyed the Sampan ride in the shopping centre at the base of the hotel and it was extremely convenient walking to the Gardens by the Bay to visit the Cloud Forest Dome.    Walk outside the foyer and catch a lift up to the walkway that runs through the hotel.  The walkway will take you over to the Marina Bay Gardens.,5,
"We stayed in the MSB hotel during our return trip from Indonesia. The hotel building is amazing and the distinctive shape is visible for miles around. We had some booking issues which could have been the booking agent or the hotel - we are not sure but we were told the the city view room we thought we had booked was not available. We paid extra and upgraded to a club room with a city view. The club rooms give you access to the club for breakfast, snacks, canopies and drinks and are higher up and so give great views. The selection of snacks and hot and cold food available at the club was very good and we ate in there instead of visiting a restaurant on the evening we arrived as we were too tired to venture out. The room was comfortable and large and the views were great. There…",4,
"Stayed 5 nights as a part of our honeymoon in the region. MBS was beyond expectation in terms of courtesy, personalised service and comfort.  I do not agree with many reviewers that staying as MBS makes you a part of the huge crowd. Not at all, the hotel is huge with many guests but it gives you everything you need in a super efficient way.  Everything you need is in the MBS. We had a premier room which was amazing. We were also surprised when they decorated our room and serviced complimentary chocolate coated strawberries to give us a honeymoon surprise.  Pool was amazing as expected. The jacuzzis on the other end of the roof top floor are definitely under rated. They are amazing not much busy and provide an exceptional view.  I highly recommend MBS and I honestly believe If…",5,
"I stayed at the hotel on 3 March on the 42nd floor in Tower 3.  The room was excellent with a great view. I stayed here because I wanted to swim in the pool having previously visited the roof top bar. I can see that the hotel management is well run,  however this is let done in execution by junior staff.  I'm sure with such a large hotel that they must be constantly hiring new staff and as such training would be an issue.    I ordered a cocktail from the pool, however after half an hour this didn't appear and when I went to the bar to find out where it was, this then involved 3 staff who neither answered my question, nor immediately got me my drink with one Indian man apologising but calling me 'Sir'. I never got my drink.  I think the ordering system should be improved with an…",4,
This was my second time at Marina Bay. The view is amazing. We went up early enough to see the area before sunset and stayed until it was dark. I was disappointed that we were not allowed to go to the bar/eating area as we were not hotel guests. The first time I visited I was able to enjoy some drinks while enjoying the view. For the cost of the elevator ride I would expect to be able to enjoy the restaurant as well. Still it was a beautiful place to see the Singapore skyline and casino in the lower level.,4,
"The experience at the Marine Bay Sands was everything I expected, and service was spot on.  I had issues with the booking company and although it took over an hour to check in, the hotel did everything they could to make sure my stay was excellent.  We stayed in a suite, the room was clean and spacious.  Although we had to take one other elevator to get to the pool, it was very easy.  This is a very busy hotel with lots of other services available.  My wife and I tend to stay away from hotels like this, but the pool was calling for me.  Very romantic place which we are planning to come back again next year.  Recommend asking for a room above the 33rd floor, or you'll have to take a second elevator to the pool (57th floor).",5,
view from the garden view room is great. We stayed in tower 3. The morning buffet line is looong.. The view from the inifinity pool is breathtaking. The location is great. and for the ones with a gambling streak a visit to the casino is must. The adjoining shopping complex is an aphrodisiac for the shopaholics.,4,
"We stayed at MBS for one night on way back to London. We chose the hotel for its iconic rooftop pool which was incredible. Overall we had a great stay, and rooms were very comfortable with great views.  However there are a few issues if you are expecting a 5 star experience:  - the size of hotel means everything is very busy including check-in, rooftop pool and restaurants, which in the end means everything is very impersonal.  - the fit and finish has been completed on the cheap in places and is starting to look and feel tatty in places, this includes the room, Sky 57 and the rooftop area. Chairs, decking and general decor in need of replacement in some instances. - air conditioning in the room was the loudest system I had come across in some time.  Despite these smallish…",3,
"The imposing Marina Sands strikes an impressive pose on the edge of Marina Bay.    The lobby is equally impressive with its 15 story ceilings creating vast open space.   The rooms themselves are comfortable.   They are of good size and nicely appointed, though some elements, including the towels, could use an upgrade.  The housekeeping services are wonderful leaving the room immaculate and well organized.  Where the hotel shines is its 55th floor fitness facilities and spectacular rooftop pool and gardens.  Swimming in the infinity pool with the Singapore skyline displayed below is breathtaking. This experience alone s worth a stay at the hotel.  An area of opportunity is continued staff development.  While courteous I had a number of disappointing experiences with the valet,…",4,
"It's a great hotel. You will be able to see this from the pictures. Also, the service is good.  Although, in the aims of being helpful I'd have to highlight some negatives. All the food is definitely overpriced. For example, the breakfast was simple and for just the meal it was £20 ($ US 30). Due to the location you are stuck at the hotel so factor this premium for all meals and drinks to derive the real price of this place. It's a shady practice and shouldn't be overlooked.  That being said, the building is truly amazing as are the views from the majority of the hotel. The service amongst the staff is as you would expect. Not expectional but good enough.  ",4,
"I had a lovely stay in Marina Bay Sands hotel! My family and I were staying there for 5 days. As soon as we arrived the staff greeted us with a smile. Sarah(one of there staffs) helped us check in(late at night) she looked sleepy and tired but still was being very helpful. I could see that there was no on in the lobby because it was about 12:00am. The room was super comfy, plush cushions, soft blankets and a long big pillows.  The next morning I was way to tired to go down and eat so I ordered some food from the room dining. The food was delicious especially the fried rice.  The pool up on the 57th floor was AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. But one thing I didn't like was that the food up there was poor. Only yogurt and toast is not enough, seriously you have to improve that, buut…",5,
"Every thing is perfect in the hotel the staff was pleasent, The Sky on 57 was gr8t and the most and unforgettable experience is swimming pool osam osam, If u don't stay in this hotel then u have not seen any thing in singapore,  my suggestion to every one is to stay in this hotel experience it . It is really very great experience unforgettable. Bye Marina Bay Sands",5,
"It's not just the rooftop view that will take your breath away - the bar prices here can have a similar effect.  Without doubt the main selling point of this hotel is the spectacular top floor pool deck.  Stayed in a city view room on the 39th floor.  Rooms are large Vegas-style with floor to ceiling windows.    On arriving at your room, and inserting the keycard into the wall, the curtains automatically open revealing an impressive vista of downtown Singapore.  The guest rooms have a nice spacious wet room shower, a comfortable bed, a sofa and a writing desk.  Best time to go for a swim is early morning before the crowds decend on the pool deck.  Go straight from your room wearing the hotel robe provided and take the lift up to the 57th floor to the rooftop infinity pool.  Only…",5,
"I have been here last August 2014 for 3 days with my family and we found this place a very AWESOME and extra ordinary. The pool on top was very brilliant and refreshing and the view from it was tremendous and stunning. The room was neat and clean and at the same time a very comfortable one. The bathroom was very pleasant and elegant. And what an excellent service from the very friendly, professional and jolly staff of  Marina Bay Sands. Thumbs up to you guys until our next stay here.",5,
"If you are lucky enough to go to Singapore, the cherry on top would be to stay in this jewel of the hospitality industry and bathe on one of the most magnificent infinity pools on the 58th floor.  Enjoy brunch by the pool and the magnificent views from all rooms... a MUST!",5,
"Marina bay was everything I'd hope, I'd recommend a stay longer than one night (this is all we could afford at the time) as there is way to many interesting things to see and do just in the hotel it's self. The sky bar, is amazing, perfect view of the sunset every night, we got some amazing photos. There are museums beneath, a shopping mall, an I've skating rink! Even a food court that says an amazing range of food. The view of the city is breath taking. It's perfect for couples, I wouldn't bring children along, but each to their own. ",5,
"Me and my husband spent a night at Marina Bay Sands for our anniversary. We had a wonderful stay so I decided to write this review. For those in Singapore as well it is a great place for a short 'staycation'. The Sky observatory is also free for hotel guests (but you get a similar view from the pool anyway). The star attraction is definitely the Infinity Pool. Do also check out the awesome Jacuzzi nearby. Best time would be early morning (it opens at 6am and around 6:30/7 pm when the sun is starting to set. The club Ku de ta is also on the same level and worthwhile to checkout. We took the garden view room (Gardens by the bay), though for those visiting Singapore the city view room might be better. Lots of food court options available in the mall also. Overall, highly…",5,
"We only stayed one night as a stop over in Singapore.  There were three of us and we decided to end out holiday on a bang at this luxury hotel.  Was not cheap but between three it was affordable.  Well what can I say!  It was luxury.  The room was lovely and the beds and pillows very comfortable.  The bathroom was awesome, a big bath tub, separate toilet and shower areas within the one room.  The infinity pool was just beautiful and we arrived early in the morning to spend a few hours here.  The view from the pool looked out over the city and was stunning.  Our room balcony view looked out over the Gardens on the Bay and the ocean.  The view of the Gardens on the Bay at night time was beautiful.  We even left our curtains open all night just for the view!  The staff were very…",5,

The pool on the 57th floor is the obvious highlight of this hotel. We stayed in it all evening and then went right back again bright and early the next morning. The staff are vigilant about making sure only hotel guests use the pool. The rooms and common areas are lovely too.,5,
"I was cautiously optimistic when booking the hotel.. because the reviews here were very mixed  to say the least.. There is a big debate.. on how many stars this hotel  is, however, I  use different comparisons when reviewing hotels I choose to stay.   The basics.. ""Check-in"" though I read reviews about how  long this process was.. I found it to be quick, efficient and friendly.. I don't believe I waited more than ten minutes (both from a check in and check out process).  The hotel is huge.. so if you like boutique hotels, this place is not for you. It has the feel of a Mega Vegas hotel.. The rooms were large, clean, had no noticeable wear,  and well appointed.. The rooms felt like any room I have has at a mega / resort . casino hotel in Vegas (nice and generic). As for what…",4,
"We were in Singapore for 4 nights, but made the decision to stay in Marina Bay Sands for just one night to try the place out and see the pool. It didn't seem reasonable to stay there for all 4 nights and pay so much for a pool we would not be using everyday anyway since we should be out exploring the city.  The rooms were nice and clean but nothing special. Oddly enough, our bathroom did not have a bathtub, which is disappointing considering the amount we had to pay. The location was good though - it was near an MRT station and there are really nice restaurants in the hotel.  The infinity pool is magnificent, as expected. It was worth what we paid for a night's stay for sure. But unless you plan on hanging out the by pool for your entire stay in Singapore, there's no need to pay…",4,
"Forget about the chocolate bar.   We came 3 years ago and it was something special. But today it is overpriced. Milky bars. Mini snickers etc.  only a very small variety of ""hand made"" chocolates. The cheese selection is just at best, I understand it has to cater for a large variety of people but majority was from all over the place. Nothing shall I say normal.   All in all what was meant to be a highlight with the family turned Into an overpriced desert bar.   Couldn't recommend it for the price.   Approx $55 Singapore   Live and learn. ",2,
"This hotel, ofcourse, is famous for the infinity pool plus huge shopping area that you can find almost every luxury brands. And the advantage is staying in this hotel, you have free wifi access in all over hotel and shopping area, restaurants ...which is quite nice. The pool is crowded with many people taking pictures, especially after 4pm. For the room decoration, I found it under average for a five star hotel, too simple with average-quality bath stuffs. The lift here maybe the fastest we have in the world right now, it takes only few seconds to go from ground floor to 30th floor. I made a booking with booking.com and was informed that the room charge was excluded of service charge and gst. However I was still suprise that they charged 17% on top of the room rate which was…",4,
"I stayed in room 3189 from 3 to 8 March while attending a conference in the Marina Bay Convention Centre.  The room was large and very well set out. It is 5 star and did not disappoint. Comfortable bed, huge bathroom, generous toiletries and great wifi it was hard to fault. In fact the only issue I had was that I couldn't get  a good cup of tea in the room (actually couldn't get a good cup of tea in Singapore but that is another story...) Otherwise hard to fault. And oh that view over the port, the gardens and the ships waiting their turn to dock was just wonderful.",5,
"My husband and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in the first week of February 2015. I decided to splurge a little and book a club room. I'm so glad we did. Club rooms are up high so the views are incredible. These rooms also come with complimentary wi-fi, breakfast, afternoon tea, evening drinks and canapés as well as access to the club lounge all day with complimentary tea, coffee etc. It is the best value for money! We would come home from wandering the city, having had a late lunch (due to our sumptuous breakfast) and then indulge in the very substantial canapés on offer from 5 - 7pm. No dinner needed! The staff were outstanding, the pool, though always a bit crowded, was wonderful and the food was delicious. The amazing shopping centre attached to the hotel was fun to wander…",5,
"We stayed in a large corner room which had a great view, however, the space was not utilised for the comfort of the guests. I felt like I was in a conference room with stark furnishings. The biggest disappointment was the massive bathroom, which had no bath, just a massive shower area. I also disliked having to queue in the middle of a shopping centre to be checked in. There was nowhere to sit out of the way and after a 13 hour flight you don't feel up to queuing. The location is good and the pool and roof top bar are amazing, but you can visit the bar when staying at a much more comfortable and personal touch hotel very nearby for half the price. ",3,
"Lets be honest....we stayed here one night simply to experience the infinity pool. After having done so, I loved every minute of it and I would absolutely do it again. I had high expectations for the pool and they were exceeded..... you simply have to see it to believe it. It wasnt as crowded as I expected it to be and most surprisingly the pool bar is ""reasonably"" priced. I say ""reasonably"" because it isnt cheap, however I expected it to be way more expensive. The drinks were actually cheaper than Clarke Quay! To summarize, the pool was phenomenal, but why does everyday prance around in their free bathrobe like they are millionaires? Anyway, we got the cheapest room, but it was HUGE, had a small balcony and had a good view of the gardens by the bay. The lobby is massive and its…",4,
"As you arrive, look up. The scale of the hotel will take your breath away. Take the elevator to the pool deck and look down. The view will take your breath away. In your room, the curtains and sheers open automatically when you insert your key. This ta-da! reveal highlights the view from your room. The hotel is attached to the underground for an easy and efficient way to get around town.",5,
"This is a must see! The roof top pool is very nice, drink service is slow so I just went to the bar each time to get drinks. If drinks aren't your thing you will likely have no complaints!  The breakfast buffet is very asian, not much for breakfast food but you can order off the menu. If you have access to the club lounge, it is really great!! Lots of fresh fruit, cheese, croissants etc as well as a hot bar for eggs, omelettes etc. We had to get a suite because we had the kids, it was HUGE, beautiful and very comfortable! A separate movie room, the main area had a couch and dining table. The bedroom was a great size, tv, huge bathroom/shower/bathtub. We enjoyed our stay!",4,

Ended up here once we discovered it. Moved from another hotel in Little India as this hotel just demands to be stayed in. The shops downstairs were just fab as was the light show in the evening... Our stay was enjoyable and we have promised to return as one stay is just not enough.  Tourist attractions are within reach and there was an MRT (equivalent of tube station) directly beneath the hotel.

The view from the top and the pool are out of this world. One day the pool was cold but the rest of the week it was lovely and warm. We arrived by taxi from the airport (S$18) and were welcomed by concierge. They were extremely helpful, very friendly and polite. We were shown around the room by the bell staff and they even stopped to spend time pointing out the sights from the window. We were on the 35th floor of tower 3 facing the city. An incredible view to wake up to. The room was huge with plenty of room for the two of us. Free water was provided daily and whilst the fridge was weighted as the mini bar we paid S$10 for our…",5,
"I was very disappointed in many instances, 1. After 25-30 minutes wait at the check-in counter, rooms finally assigned were completely different from my reservation...as Hotel staff mentioned no availability although it already passed 3pm as official check-in time...we were forced to King bed rooms rather than Twin beds and worse is it is not really King! meaning Queen, i.e. very small and squeeze.  2. Pool was dirty with a lot of funny stuff floating around and I have a strong doubt about E.coli.   3. I came across the defected TV and safe which forced me to call a maintenance which is simply a waste of time. Overall, very bad and unacceptable experience and I will never ever stay at Marina-Bay.",2,
"My partner and I only stayed here for 1 night so we tried to make the most of our time here. We booked a room in Tower 3 with a balcony overlooking Gardens by the Bay, great view.  Tried our luck at their casino, which was quite overwhelming compared to Crown casino in Melbourne.  Highlight: of course was the SkyPark!  We dined at the rooftop restaurant overlooking the city, the food was amazing, very pricey though. As a couple our bill came to over $350.  The next morning we swam in the Infinity pool.  Everything about this place is amazing! If we could've afforded it, we would've stayed here our whole stay in Singapore!",5,

"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands with a friend for one night to finish off our South East Asia tour. We booked it as a bit of a treat, as the location is so iconic.  Is it worth the money? I would say yes and no.  The rooms are very nice quality with excellent fittings. The building itself is simply stunning, the architecture, etc. It’s hard to not just stand there and marvel at the beauty of this place.  The infinity pool is more amazing than what it looks in the pictures.  This hotel is very big and very busy and as a result I felt the service wasn’t as personalised as what I thought it would be given the cost, however the staff are very polite and accommodating.  It is annoying that this hotel check in is so late (3pm) with an early checkout (11am), please keep this in mind…",4,

Was met by iPad toting staff who contacted the driver who then whisked me directly to the hotel where I was met by another iPad-toting guest services person who accompanied me with my luggage to my room, checked me in and left the keys. Never had to stand in line at a counter. Check out was equally simple. Look at the bill on the TV, drop the keys into an ATM-like device in the lobby and the bill is emailed to you. No standing in line, no waiting, VERY efficient! This should be the standard!  The views from my 49th floor room were great. Rooms overlooking the Tree Garden all have balconies.

"Would like to thank the staff at Sands for making our overnight stay so enjoyable.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  The room was fantastic - we upgraded to a Suite and it was just amazing!  95 sq meters of pure luxury, you almost needed a map to get around the rooms!  First stop was the infinity pool whilst our room was being prepared, a lovely view and so relaxing, there was simply no hurry!  The afternoon high tea was nice, but not the service style we saw in the brochures, which was a bit disappointing. It was a buffet style, with a good choice of cakes and fruit but did not see any sandwiches.  Service was still impeccable.  The evening cocktail session was very pleasant with a very good selection of food.  The hotel is close to the Gardens by the Bay, and that was…",5,
"Great hotel! Everything screams luxory and the staff is SO nice. However, The price is so steep.... I feel like they are charging too much. Beware of the giftshop, $22 for a little container of ice cream. Regardless, the building is beautiful, the pool is out of this world, the area is gorgeous, and you will have a good and relaxing time. Just be prepared to have your wallet cleaned out much faster than you would think :).",4,
"I stayed here for business trip. This hotel gets a lot of traffic because of how many rooms it offers, the attached casino, the tours to the top and it's attachment to the shops. It's a little pricier than most hotels, but how often can you say that you stayed at the Marina Bay Sands. The infinity pool view is AMAZING! One of the coolest views from a hotel I've ever experienced. The rooms were nice and clean. I had no problems with any of the staff. They have a great workout facility and a great spa as well. The restaurant Sky 57 has unbelievable views and the food there is incredible. Some of the best wagyu beef I've ever had. The buffet on the main floor is vast and very good as well. I plan on bringing my family with me on my next trip. I would highly recommend this hotel if…",5,
"We stayed here for f1 and if you stay you can use the infinity pool and attractions on the roof which is a must for anyone the view is wonderful but you do feel a bit on edge going towards the edge, food was good and it has excellent transport links to other areas, it was expensive but we did pay for F1 weekend so it's probably cheaper at other times.  We will return and explore some more in the future, there are packages you can buy from the hotel ",5,

Despite being warned we could not check in till 15.00 we got our room at 11& it was on the 48th floor overlooking the gardens and the GP circuit,a view to die for ! We would not normally go for a hotel of this size but I have to say it was very well run, clean and all staff were on top of their game. Thoroughly recommended.",5,
"You walk in and the foyer is very large, so far it looks so good. Although there is nothing actually that grand about the foyer except the size (and even then I've seen bigger). For the price I was paying I was expecting to be blown away by everything, but boy was I disappointed. The rooms are fairly nice and if you are lucky you will get a view of the gardens. However, throughout my stay I started to notice how this hotel was made on the cheap. The finishings did not look good and sometimes I would walk past a hole in the wall or wallpaper falling off. For the price you pay, you expect everything to be high quality but its obvious this hotel was made on the cheap and it charges a fortune to increase profits. The buffet breakfast is a complete rip off. From memory it was about…",1,

Lot's og people everywhere. This is business and the Asian guests love these vibes.  As for me, well I cannot see the charm. The hotel as landmark, well yes spectacular, fun to see experience, but not a place I would pick for future stays.  Big next door mall with all high-end brand shops - not many people visiting (?)

The rooms were very pricey for what you get in the room. You got provided with the basics and a little more for a room.There is decent space to move around in. Beds were comfy and I had a good night sleep with no distractions. Everything was clean and tidy. The views were so beautiful from the hotel balcony and even more so at night.

Make sure you go to the bayfront station to get to the hotel/casino .. dont do what i did and went to Marina bay station haha You have to be a room guest to enter the infinity pool which was awesome.

"Was staying whilst at conference. At check in the room was not ready, and it was not ready for hours, so we were given a communal suite in which to relax. Service was good , food was great , rooms were clean, and the pool was AWESOME!! Sometimes key cards did not work, this was annoying. Otherwise a good experience on a LARGE scale,",4,
"Stayed here each time we visit Singapore. However, the novelty of this hotel has definitely worn off. The infinity pool, views and club lounge are second to none BUT the crowds and the bad poolside service starts to wear thin. The wifi was appalling unless you wanted to pay extra for it. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is a dream. The major problem we found is that we were effectively just another nameless faceless guest. We stayed for 5 nights this time round and not one person remembered our names or our preferences. This is very disappointing as we expected better from a high end hotel and paid good money for the privilege. This hotel has to be experienced once maybe twice but more than that will leave you feeling let down by the lack of personal service.",3,
"An iconic building with its 3 towers and the boat-shaped roof top that carries a huge swimming pool from where you get a panoramic view of the city and the breath-taking feeling of swimming in the skies.!! You need to be a  hotel guest though, in order to be able to swim there.  Lovely location, next to the Bay by the Gardens, and easy train rides to all the shopping places  Good food but really busy at breakfast time, especially if you want the rooftop restaurant.  A costly place but well worth a stay, even if it is only for 1 night.",5,
A wonderful hotel and the pool and views over the city are truly amazing. The spa is expensive but well worth it. Staff are very helpful and friendly. If you are on a low floor (I was on 4) it can be quite noisy during the night from the lobby so ask for as high a floor as you can get.,4,
We have book a premium city view room and we have been upgraded to a suite. Very happy with their check in and check out service (lucky we were upgraded to suite room cause suite room have a special queue and not many people in the queue. The normal check out queue was very long. We are also happy about the upgrade.   Room is spacious with separate living and bedroom. We stayed in 22nd floor in tower 1.  Very nice city view? We have to take the lift to lobby and change to another lift that take us to the pool. Or take to 25th or 26th level and change lift. You will need room key card per guest going up to the pool. I requested extra key card to leave it in the room and keep the electricity on when we are out.   We travel with a 19 months old and he is still drinking milk. The…,5,
Super super super!! Marina Bay Sands is best ever hotel!!  I have no words to describe an infinity pool on rooftop.. My mom and me were happy to stay there!!  Amazing view from the window (gardens of the bay)! Everything you need is nearby !,5,
"The place simply thorws you off your feet.... offers all possible entertainement options..including casino.. bretahtaking towers & the observation deck on top...  simply amazing, one got to visit it to believe it ... wide variety of retsuarants, grand lobby areas, busy woth tourists, yet offers a comfortable time in this place...",5,
"What I enjoyed around here is the asymmetrical architecture of the various high rise buildings. Though artificial, it adds a strange beauty to the entire surroundings and the bay area. The imposing architecture of Marina Bay Sands Hotel has to be seen to be believed! When the entire bay area and the skyline is lit up at night along with the laser light displays, the region simply appears out of this world. The mall and the food court could be a bit expensive. The area is still developing and I am at a loss to visualize how it will look like in a few years time!",5,
A bit pricey for shopping with very high end stores but overall a huge asset to the area and always free to window shop.  Outside the doors is a walking path overlooking the Singapore River where a frequent nighttime light show is performed in the mist of the fountains.  Don't miss it!  Be prepared to stand in queue for a taxi during busy times but it is well organized and moves quickly.,4,
"The hotel is just amazing if you consider its size and architecture. We stayed in the tower 3 level 37 with view on the garden supertrees (city view seems more expensive) The room was really nice and huge and there was even a small balcony with bougainvillea flowers.  The bathroom had only a large shower (by the way take care of the slippery marble floor !) The desk is a nice place to work with power and connectivity but there should be a dim light instead of a huge bright light.  I have noticed that rooms located on lower floors had their entrance door overlooking the atrium which may be noisy especially on tower 1 were there is the huge breakfast area. The pool is just amazing of course, but I think that the white towels left on brown deck chairs by patrons are not very…",4,
"Hotel is big n clean with balcony, spacious! the most   Thrilling should be the sky park pool! But food n drink there is costly. Not much activity unless u love gamble, however there alley where you can mak some shopping fix",4,
"Stayed here as part of a conference in Singapore.  An extremely interesting three tower property that immediately catches your eye as it has a CRUISE SHIP balanced on top of the towers.  The reception and door staff are extremely professional and the rooms are clean and efficient.  The daily buffet is phenomenal (albeit pricey) and features everything you could possibly think of, including one of the best sushi spreads I've ever seen.  The top attraction is the rooftop pool / bar area over looking the city.  This is what the ""cruise ship"" manifests as for guests and is a tremendous time.  All in all I will look forward to returning to this propety in the future.",5,
"Having stayed in Singapore a number of times, I was always fascinated with the Marina Bay Sands project. I’d shopped there, walked the parks, and visited the museum. I finally got to stay there this time and to be honest it didn’t entirely live up to my expectations.   The staff were very pleasant, but the little things just weren’t there. I mean, you pay a premium to stay there and I expect that when I turn my air conditioner on and the lights on in the bathroom it doesn’t short circuit the power every 10mins. The Wi-Fi is incredibly slow unless you pay a $20SIN premium and the breakfast is just ok. Don’t get me wrong the view is great, but $28 bucks to enter Ku De Ta after 9pm when you’re staying at the hotel is too much and the drink prices when you enter are ridiculously.  …",3,
"Even without any words from me you are extremelly likely to visit this area as it is the main attraction of the City. Outstanding, day or night, perhaps more enjoyable in the evening. Aside the buildings and the bridge, there is a huge shopping centre with enormous casino within (free for foreigners, need to present passport). At 20:00 you have a laser show, with some music, there is also nice night outdoor food area with very reasonable prices, and tasty food off course. The place you can visit many times, even just to walk around.",5,
Stayed just for one night and enjoyed the infinity pool and the amazing view! It is a bit expensive but it's a must try!!!! The only bad part of our experience is the coffee :) but that was the only bad part. The staff are friendly and willing to help and are all very well presented. Thanks Marina Bay Sands :),4,
"We spent three nights at Suite room, it was surprisingly new and moden and the room got a great view of Marina Bay. Do not miss your time for skypool on top floor and enjoy some cocktails and see the amazing skyline. There are many great restaurants at the hotel and try one by one if you have time.",5,
"What an experience it was oh so soreal one of the best views ever, the pool was out of this world unbelievable with fantastic views of Signapore. The shopping was unbelievable and as for the choice of restaurants a must visit",5,
The whole area is very modern and represents an architectural wonder and a structural marvel. The shopping mall is worth visiting to examine the curved structures and extremely pleasant areas to walk around. Really not to be missed as this is unique in the world. Contains also a garden and a science museum for special expositions.,5,
"We love the spacious room and especially the bathroom!!! Great view of the garden especially at night where you will enjoy the scenery of lights at the Gardens by the Bay. Though the checking-in was a bit longer, the waiting time were killed off by the musicians who played the instruments for us to enjoy!  Easy access to the shopping mall and eateries in MBS. A true life experienced being spoilt living in a luxurious hotel and had a spree of window shoppings for branded stuffs!  Oh not to forget the pool! Panoramic view at night were breathtaking. At night, you will be amazed of the city as you watch the laser lights shining to the sky with the musical waters. During the day, the view were amazing too!",5,
Excellent suits! Amazing skypool. Foods are great! Its just that i stayed at the non-smoking tower so everytime i had to go outside of the hotel to smoke :(  Room service guys are very nice and helpful. You can ask for anything ;),5,
"Lots of fantastic memories - just a couple of niggles, but overall a wonderful and spectacular place. Really was worth it for a quick family holiday. The whole place is very special, the rooftop pool is just perfect (albeit busy) and the shopping mall is a treat.  We were lucky enough to stay in an Orchard Suite with a City view but it also had a small view of the ocean side also. Fantastic room - everything you'd want. We had two small kids who had a ball there and the staff made up the spare bed for them.   This place really is a machine, a LOT of people come through this hotel, but they do it exceptionally well. Staff overall were just fantastic and the hostesses at the club lounge on level 55 deserve a mention. On the second day they recognised the family by name and just…",5,
"Well, what to say about Marina Sands Bay hotel?! It's Singapore landmark, famous for its infinity pool on the 57th floor overlooking Marina Bay and the city center. The room was spacious and well furnished, but still nothing special for the price you pay to stay there. Free wifi in the room. Swimming in the infinity pool is an experience for life! Good hotel, but pricey. Just beware of using minibar- they tried to charge my credit card for the items I have never used from the minibar. I complained and asked them to make a double check... They apologized and promised my credit card will be refunded.",5,
"Our family staying at this hotel on December 15th, 2014 for 2 nights. we used to stay in MBS everytime we went to singapore. This was my 5th visit staying in the grand club room with the city view. After this last experiences, NO way we are going back to the casino or the hotel.   Long story: 1.  I liked to go to casino while my wife watching me played in casino table. The 2nd night is the worst night, I put $200 bet on the the table and leave the table to get a drink (just 10 seconds). When i came back, my bet is gone.. I raised the issue to the dealer. But the dealer said there is no bet.. So i raised the problem to the pit boss.. the crazy thing, the pit boss just asked question to the dealer: do you see any bet on that side. The dealer said NO. Then no action taken.. So, I…",1,
Go and see the very spectacular building. I don´t know if I think it is beautiful or ugly. But it is very impressive and spectacular! Surely worth a visit. Go to the Hotel Lounge on the top floor. Good view over Singapore and good drinks.,5,
Me n my family had a relaxing weekend at thIs architecture master piece.  Swimming pool and specially the view from it was amazing. Specious rooms with comfortable beds.Overall a wonderfully experience with wide choice of  food n casino at mall.,4,
I liked it the marina bay sands hotel was nice. Over priced a little but all in all good and wonderful :) amazing experince,5,
"if you want to take a picture like millions of others AND with millions of others, in the roof pool, go for it. I found the pool disgusting. The restaurant on the last floor has amazing views and overpriced food.",3,
"What an amazing hotel!!!! I like to enjoy famous or luxurious hotels and this one didn't let me down. The infinity pool, the bar next to it, 2 great restaurants on the 57th floor and not to mention the countless other places to drink and eat. a must visit if you like luxury",5,
"Although this hotel is expensive, it is a once in a lifetime experience.   The infinity pool on the 57th level overlooking Marina Bay and downtown Singapore is beyond belief.    It has a huge casino and large shopping mall on site.   The sky bar and observation deck is like nothing you have ever seen.    It is definitely a check on the bucket list.    Highly recommended when visiting Singapore...if only for one night.",5,
"Before climbing on the top I want to go Singapore Flyer (as its the highest in the world) but after it was not necessary. View is amazing. I dislike such fact that guests who doesn't live in the hotel cannot see the pool, bar and everything else except view area.",5,
"I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands during my last three visits to Singapore. It is a great hotel but not at all cosy. I stay there because of the Skypark with the huge infinity pool, the great fitness centre and the convenient location of the hotel with easy access to public transport. MBS is a landmark in it itself. Huge! With an impressive shopping mall attached, theatres, museum and a big casino. The shopping mall is great, plenty of different brand shops, but rather expensive, good food out-lets. The museum has interesting exhibitions. I have been to a few shows at the theatres and these have been good. I haven't visited the casino. You will of course be impressed the moment you enter the huge hotel lobby, but I do not really like these kind of hotel factory places - too big,…",4,
So much to see here from the gardens by the bay to the buildings and especially the marina bay hotel.We have never seen such a fantastic hotel especially the rooftop swimming pool and observation deck up on the 56th floor.WOW what a view of Singapore.A must visit area.,5,
"One of the best hotel we've stayed at. Was spotted by the staff in check-in queue with my 2 kids grumpy, immediately fast tracked to check-in. A bit inconvenience when given the original room as hot water was under maintenance. Called the reception and immediately given a room change. Room itself was awesome, fell in love as door was opened. Roof swimming pool was totally cool. Kids enjoyed the infinity pool so much that they didn't want to get out. View was spectacular.",5,
"This hotel is modelled on the Vegas format - casino, shops, restaurants and big, clean rooms.  With that you can't go wrong.  It probably isn't as affordable as a Vegas hotel in comparison, but this isn't necessarily apples to apples.  The one thing you must do here is go to the infinity pool right at the top of the hotel - it looks like a boat is sitting on top of the three towers linking them together from outside.  It is so nice up there. The longest one in the world, and you'll want to spend the longest time in it!  It's well located, the rooms are big & clean, and the service is very efficient and friendly. There isn't much else I can say about this hotel, there is certainly nothing bad to say, except if you don't like lots of people, that might annoy you as this is a big…",5,
"As everyone knows, its one of the best architecture that you can see in Singapore. Roof top swimming pool with a ship shaped hotel, it stands at the marina bay waterfront and is definitely lucrative for the tourists to love and spend a night there.  Spending a night in this hotel, experiencing the pool, casino in the basement, one of the best night clubs of the city and fabulous eating establishments is not something you get everyday on a platter !  The breakfast, however is costly so you may opt for room without breakfast and you can get amazing food at half the price outside.  So spend wisely there, but a nights stay in the hotel is must as the view from the roof top  is a must see for people visiting Singapore !",4,
"We read some of the reviews before we went there. Saying this hotel is too big is almost like blaming McDonald's for offering fast food. Yeah it's big: three towers and an enormous rooftop pool spanning the entire length. That's the whole point of the hotel isn't it?   So to the point, this hotel isn't cheap so should you stay here? The answer in our books is a wholehearted YES!  We're not saying you should stay weeks on end, we only stayed for one night, checked in early and it was definitely worth every Sin dollar.   In response to other negatives: do you feel like a number here? The staff definitely try their best to add a personal touch. Which is challenging due to the sheer size of the place. However, we ordered breakfast room service and got the most courteous treatment by…",5,
"Our family ( incl teenage children) had a fantastic stay at this landmark hotel. We felt like royalty, and the luxurious and upmarket feel really reinforces your holiday ambiance. The infinity pool/spa is the best and a must do.The location is fabulous and easy and cheap to get around all of Singapore by taxi.",5,
"I stay there in the month of Mar-15. The hotel in itself is a city. It's huge. Major attraction is Casino, Sky Bar and awesome Infinity Pool. Being in the pool is enough to get the worth of payment you made for rooms. The view from pool is once in a life time experience",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is one of those ‘destination’ hotels that I had been looking to tick off the list for a while. While I didn’t have high expectations, I was pleasantly surprised to find that despite its huge scale and all the razzle dazzle, the hotel delivered well on service and comfort.  The rooms are understated and quiet, everything feels clean, fresh and modern, and there are enough elevators to move everyone around without waiting.  The famous pool is as amazing as you would expect, though the pool area itself is hectic, with people clamouring for one of the too-few pool lounges at all hours of the day, children running around and everyone heading to the edge of the pool for a selfie.  Don’t expect to go to the pool area to relax.  One of the best things about the hotel is…",5,
"Stayed there with my husband as part of a business trip.  Because of the sheer size of the place, takes a bit to get used to which tower you're allocated to and where is the tower.  No doubt, there is a casino, designer shopping mall but it can be a lot of walking here and there, and the need for consciously remembering which direction you will need to go when getting back to the room!  However, the shops are beautiful, the eateries are divine and the atmosphere is sophisticated.  Coupled with friendly and attentive staff, who could ask for more.  We were in a club room, so were able to enjoy the dining provided by the infinity pools which was sumptuous.  We had drinks at Sky on 57 to enjoy the spectacular view before experiencing Ku de Ta sky lounge (even if we're not really…",5,
"Everything is great... The best hotel i've been to. Bar, casino, pool, mall, whatever your needs, easy access , professional services , really enjoyed the time during tha stay, maybe i will stay there again",5,
"The staff are all wonderful. The room, view and the infinity pool was all worth paying for.  It's indeed a one night memorable and romantic stay for us.  Definitely will come back and suggest the hotel to anyone travelling in Singapore.",5,
"I stayed here for a night with my two sisters when they came over for a visit. The room was spacious and your average 5 star hotel. I guess the special thing was the size of the bathroom which was very large and grand. The balcony had a beautiful view and the pool even a better view. We also had room service snack and the food was good but nothing wow. The service was alright. And heaps too many people using the hotel which makes it so.. Crowded? Like a market? It's a great hotel. But there are heaps of hotels in Singapore that are just as good, just not as well known. Definitely worth a try though!",4,
"Very nice hotel, large room and there is a lot to see around the property. Would like to come back here again one day. The swimming pool was a great place to relax and have a few drinks. If you like shopping there is a lot of shops in the mall next to the hotel.",5,
"In order to celebrate the last day of Chinese New Year or known by Chinese as 'Cap Go Meh', me snd my husband went to Singapore just to see how's the celebration of Cap Go Meh in that country. I've made a surprise and booked Marina Bay Sands as it is very famous in Indonesia, especially my friends. They said the infinity pool is very amazing and the hotel and the room is good. Well, honestly speaking after we checked in, it doesn't seems as amazing as my friends told me. I agree that the room is spacious and the view directly to new tourism object Garden by the Bay, but, it's not that fantastic compared to other hotel offered the same spectacular view. For the price of S$1,100 (almost S$1,300 after tax) the room became not that worth it, no bathtub, bad smell soap and shampoo,…",3,
"Upon our arrival last March 3, 2015, The place is awesome!. MBS employee are very friendly and they are mostly from the Philippines. The second day we went up to try the Infinity pool. That is the great experienced ever. Food also are very good, Breakfast buffet and you must try Thursday dinner buffet near the lobby of Tower 1. This place is absolutely awesome.....",5,
"The MBS is itself a tourist attraction. The architecture will take your breath away inside and out, both at day time and night time. It's so huge you can enjoy a day or half just wandering in and around MBS. My room was upgraded from Deluxe to Premier with no extra charge! What a delight. The rooftop infinity pool overlooking the city is just so amazing. There's a train line directly connected to MBS so taking public transpo is convenient and easy.",5,
Panoramic beautiful view of famous buildings above the marina bay tower at 56th floor and the amazing pool at 57th roof,5,
"You would not expect it to be bad, would you?  We only spent one night here. Our last night in Singapore. This hotel is absolutely brilliant.  Our only problem in the magnificent hotel, was another guest.   I want to recommend anyone visiting Singapore to stay here at least for 1 night!  I was told that the breakfast is expensive and average quality. So I took a room without breakfast, and rather ate in the shopping mall. There we found great food for 20 Singapore dollars. - The breakfast at the hotel cost 45 pr person!",5,
"Wow. I was lost for words the moment I walked into this Hotel. It is amazing. It is like its own city. The structure is amazing to look at. It consists of 3 towers with an infinity pool across the top joining the towers together. This infinity pool is huge with plenty of areas for sitting both in the sun and shade but the water was cold. You had to go in though for the experience. Fantastic views over the City and water. There is a casino, designer shopping mall and fantastic restaurants.",5,
I have stayed last week in the MBS and booked via the hotel website clicking the linked B&B.  Trusted the MBS website and when I checked out to find that the hotel were charging me the Breakfast and telling me that it was my mistake. When I mention that the room was not clean properly with sugary drink stain on the table. The reception agree to cancel the breakfast. Now in London just realise that instead of refunding the difference on my deposit the hotel have charge me the refund. Who is an overcharge of more than 300 Singaporean dollars. Not impressed by this type of error. Great check in and efficient service. I want to stay at the MBS because it became and icon building for Singapore. My all experience has been average and not sure I will like to stay again.,3,
"The best hotel I have ever stayed at, hands down.  Service was unparalleled from the moment you got out of your taxi or limo.  The hotel is MASSIVE and encompasses three towers with views of the city and the gardens, a casino, and a mall larger than any I had ever been in with an actual river and gondola in the middle of it.  Rooms were high tech and super clean.  Pool is arguably the best in the world, sitting on the 57th floor and overlooking the city.  It can easily accommodate the number of guests from a large hotel such as this. Value was actually quite good as well, but the dining options seemed a bit pricey.",5,
"Everybody who knows Singapore knows Marina Bay Sands and with good reason, it looks amazing from the outside and is just as impressive inside. Brilliant facilities with an unbelievable swimming pool and view. We upgraded our room to a club room so we had breakfast and the club facilities included, the room was big but maybe not as luxurious as I would have hoped. I also found that maybe it lost some of the personal touches due to the sheer size of the hotel but on the whole it was a great experience. I did do the express check out as the queue for normal check out was long, this was 2 days ago and I'm still waiting for my invoice to emailed so  I would maybe not recommend doing that.",4,
"Stayed here as part of our honeymoon trip. We informed them of this prior to our stay, and when we arrived 3 hours before check in time they stored our luggage and gave us temporary pool passes to use. They then told us to use to pool and they would have a room ready for us within the hour. Even though it was a Saturday day time we got to the pool to find the adult section empty.  The pool was as you would guess, amazing. A great relief in the blazing 32 degree Singapore sun. After enjoying the pool for an hour we went back in to check in 2 hours early only to find they had upgraded our room for free and put us on a high floor.  This was all fantastic, and I could not recommend their service more. The previously checked luggage was then brought to our room about 20 minutes…",5,
Its a landmark hotel on the waterfront of Singapore. The hotel has the best aminities to offer and some of the finest eating establishments by renowned celebrity chefs. The best nightclub in the city and great views of the harbour. There is a casino in the basement. Its pretty much a city in a city.,5,
We stayed at the hotel due to its iconic nature. Whilst it was excellent to swim in the Sky park swimming pool that was about it. I can see it becoming a Disney type hotel in the future. The prices for inner hotel food was very expensive.,3,
"I got to stay in a city view deluxe room as a bit of a birthday treat!  I've always wanted to swim in the infinity pool and it did not disappoint, even if it was fresher than you would expect!   It would be well worth buying a waterproof casing for your phone or camera, there are a crazy amount of people taking their phones in with them regardless but still! The hotel offers a photography service but I think you're better taking your own. Plus watching peoples personal photo shoots is at times hilarious!  For such an enormous hotel it its incredibly quiet. And moving around the place is really easy. The staff are really attentive and helpful.   We ate at DB's french bistro which was a feast and they added some ace birthday magdelines at the end of the night!   The only downer…",4,
I stayed just one night with my sister and husband before going on a cruise. OMG what a place superb setting such an iconic looking building.  Enjoyed a swim in the roof pool overlooking the city.  A very memorable stay.  Room food service all top class which one would expect from a hotel with a fairly hefty $ price tag!,5,
"Had a great time at MBS on my valentine's day for this year. The room was cozy and comfortable. Temperature room could be adjusted to 16 degree which make you even want to hug your love ones more. The balcony is spacious but was dirty, just enjoy the night in room is gd enough. Very gd to hug and spend privacy moment with your love ones. Privacy and comfort are definitely there.",4,
"That hotel is just Whaaaao, beautiful ! and the swimming pool is very impressive. I loved it  the boutique up there is also great, the restaurant also.  I like the room very much, I wa with my sister and dad. We ordered room service, that was very good. The only thing that I can say is maybe the price is too expensive for the room that we get. T After, the thing is that there is so many people, and they is not very a warm welcome.. and inside the hotel, it's like  a mall, with so many restaurants and boutiques!!",4,
"We spent the first two nights of our honeymoon at this hotel. We didnt get the honeymoon package. Our check in experience was excellent. We walked up to the check in desk and we were first in line, all staff were busy. A woman rushed up to us and ushered us into a members onky lounge where a man checked us in and apologised for the delay (the was zero delay!) We mentioned that it was our honeymoon and he gave us the best available room with a city view as well as extending our checkout until 1pm. We were very happy with our room, we loved that it had an international power socket because we forgot to buy an adaptor. We were very happy with our stay here. My only advice is to not eat in the hotel but to go to a hawker centre instead, the food is much better and cheaper.",5,
"I am writing this sitting in the Club at Mandarin Oriental Singapore after the nights in a Club room at MBS. What a relief! I can understand the generally positive reviews from guests at MBS: if you have not experienced being a guest at a hotel like MO or Shangri-La then you can be beguiled by the view from the pool at MBS. We were at our first stay. Our return visit left us disappointed. Not with the staff who are very good but with what was offered to Club guests. The lobby is cavernous and feels like an airport rather than a luxury hotel. The ""VIP lounge/registration"" feels, again, like an airport check-in where you have to stand while you wait in a queue.  The  room was a good size but had very little storage and sparse furnishings. The new Club is a big improvement and the…",2,
"This was my birthday treat. I was on a big holiday, to celebrate a ""painful"" birthday, and after 2 weeks in Bali I checked into MBS for the night of my birthday. I have been to Singapore many many times as I have worked there in the past. The bar / restaurant at MBS has impressed me the first moment I saw it so I thought I'll treat myself to a night in this hotel. When I checked in, I was so pleased to hear that I was upgraded to the Club Lounge with all sorts of benefits as a gift for my birthday. That was so lovely!! My room was massive and overlooking the city. The room was beautiful, big bathroom and the bed was heaven. I got free breakfast, afternoon tea and ""evening nibbles with drinks"" - this turned out to be a full blown buffet with free flow of champagne! - included…",5,
Brilliant Hotel excellentely build and one can enjoy laser show in night and shopping arcade built inside it and hotel comprisses of three tower,4,
"So many things to mention about this Hotel that are just sensational. I agree with many of the other positive reviews here. Stand out note would be the staff. They know how to do their job so well. There when you need them, but your left alone when you want privacy. I experienced a  new level of standard from our stay here. Its not just accommodation, its an experience in its self. Id skip a day at Sentosa Island for an extra day at this Hotel (""Resort""). If you can stay here, consider yourself lucky.",5,
"The building is very impressive and the view from the top was quite superb but costs!, but overall we were a little underwhelmed as a whole. If you like shopping at some of the high end stores, then this is the place for you, but we tried to go to the casino, and the restaurants were only really for members only and the promenade only had one reasonable place to eat, to which took 40 minutes just to get some garlic bread. The water show they advertise is a little uneventful and would probably just go here in the day. If you are going to the casino, be warned -take your passport!!!!  Also if you are asthmatic or do not like cigarette smoke then do not go here as the casino floors are smoking and are soo overwhelming to the sinuses if you are not used to it.",3,
"This is a must see for visitors. For S$23.00 you get a birds eye view of Singapore.  If you are a photographer as I am, make sure you bring you camera.",5,
"Stayed here on business. You will not find friendlier, more obliging staff to make your stay easier. And the rooms. They are stunning. I had a city view from the 42nd floor. Superb. Should be a bath in this kind of a room though. Every restaurant I dined at was good, drinks were equally so. Pool, as you expect. Stunning. Go to Ku de ta on 57th floor for evening drinks. ",4,
"Roof pool is amazing. View is fantastic!!,food is fantastic either for breakfast or lunch or dinner. The rooms are very confortable and beautiful! Next time I will go to Singapore , I will stay again in the splendid hotel!!",5,
"Staying at this amazing hotel last week on my business trip for 2 nights. Roof top infinity pool is simply superb, relaxing and what a great view from the pool side. Room was really nice with a attached mini bar :) One of the most popular tourist place ""Garden by the bay"" is just behind the hotel, which I could see from the hotel room. Food is excellent! The hotel has direct access to adjacent shopping mall and a huge casino. Taxi is available 24 hours, there is also a MRT (Metro) station just below the hotel. I really enjoyed a lot during my stay :)",5,
"Stay at their 2 different suite for two nights with my family. Given the suite at 50+ levels and free pool access anytime of the day. Complimentary hi tea and evening cocktail for two.   Good food, good surroundings and awesome scenery at night. It was certainly a memorable night for all of us. Shopping was easy and effortless. Connecting the hotel and the shopping mall. If you can't sleep at night, swing by to the casino and try your luck.",5,
"Stayed in one of their club rooms and it was of a good standard. Only used the Club room which is really a restaurant for breakfast, which was very good and the staff fantastic. In fact all the staff were very helpful and always very welcoming and charming. Very large hotel so not for a romantic stay. Infinite pool 57th Floor, is breathe taking and the views over Singapore stunning, you couldn't get much better.",4,
"Amazing hotel. Was greeted warmly and check in was a breeze.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Hotel is very clean and modern. Lovely views, especially from the infinity pool. The gym was great with nice views as well. Drinks in the hotel can be pricey, but overall alcohol is very expensive in Singapore. Overall, had a great experience and loved this hotel. Would recommend.",5,
"If first impressions matter then this unique property has it all!  Driving in from the airport the stunning architecture is clearly visible and so outstanding.  We had read many reviews on TripAdvisor (which we love) and had cleaned a lot of good advice from many contributors, thank you!  We had purposed to get into Tower One rather than the others because of the TripAdvisor reviews and this was a smart move.  We had two rooms a few floors apart, one facing the bay and the other facing the gardens.  Both were similar sized and very well spaced out.  We were here for a stay of more than 10 days and so we wanted good space.  Both rooms had that.  The bathrooms were well sized and were the same, well laid out, with twin basins, a large free standing soaking tub, a large walk in…",5,
"Wow!! Fantastic Hotel, beautiful rooms, the roof pool is amazing!!! Wifi is superb! Would definetly recomend this Hotel:) Food is  great and shopping center in the same building. Taxi is always at the Hotel.",5,
We liked just about everything we saw within this beautiful hotel. The casino was enormous and very well security guarded. For overseas visitors you would have to pass 3 security checks with passport in hand.  I found this a bit annoying considering that we were at the enterance of the casino and had already got through a security check.,5,
"A very comfortable room of each categories have. Food and few high class restaurant is located at Marina B1, or L2. Casino as well.",5,
"Stayed with my friend for 2 nights last year and i really enjoyed. After being out the whole day, we spent the night going around the shoppes and swimming at the infinity pool. I really loved the view from the pool. the pool maybe small but the top floor is really the selling factor of this hotel. Wish i could stay here often and go night swimming every time i want. Will definitely stay with my family next time!",4,
"Stayes for two nights in a club room and the experience was worth the money. Room itself was way smaller than expected, but otherwise nice. Garden view with all the ships at the sea also nice.  Club lounge was a nice touch as well, maybe not as relaxed and ""loungy"" as expected, bit more of a snack restaurant. Infinity pool on top deck lovely. Staff very professional and helpful.   Only minua was that if you want to go to center you need to take subway every time, hotel is located on a landfill and surrounded by water. Over the nice bridges the walk to center is a bit far. On the other hand there's a HUGE shopping mall at the hotel premises with all kinds of services, so you don't necessarely need to leave at all! :D  Would recommend this as a experience but for a longer stayy…",5,
"Still staying for the 3rd night at the hotel. Feelings are mixed as this is the 4th time coming to Singapore. Plus points get the view from the rooms the swiming pool, that is beyond imagination and the kudeta night club. Minus poinds go to the quality of rooms the service and the fact that the hotel is massive making getting around frustrating. We stayed once to Fulerton bay hotel and twice at Marina Mandarin and overall was much better and more relaxing.",3,
Great swimming pool and fabulous view to the skyscrapers. Infinity roof top pool is spectacular. The room is huge with a separate bedroom and living area. Enjoy my stay at this great hotel in singapore!!!!,5,
"We booked this hotel prior to a cruise and it was an amazing choice. Its a little expensive but well worth it for the experience. The check in at 10am was so quick.. our room on 50th floor was nothing short of amazing. The concierge was at our hotel room before us and he opened the door and put the key card in and as the curtains opened we gasped at the skyline. Floor to ceiling windows...it was breathtaking. We paid a little extra for a city view and it was priceless.. we found ourselves just looking out at the skyline.. The room was huge with a big seating area and huge bed with two tv's and the bathroom with walk in shower was beautiful. We headed straight up to the 57th floor to the infinity pool, got ourselves some loungers and had a swim...our tummies wooped just before we…",5,
"Here for a conference and thought the place was just outstanding. Everything just top class. Always busy, always attentive & always trying to please.  This comment does not just refer to people / staff, but also the complex, the offerings etc.  thought it was an awesome experience, particularly the SkyPark.",4,
"The view from the top of Marina Bay is spectacular- I really appreciated the ""location boards"" showing specific buildings etc. not scary at all as there is a wall around and you feel quite safe. The food hall was very good with a big choice, reasonable prices and easy to get to.",4,
This is an wonderful architecture. The few at the top of the deck is awesome. The photo service  are too expensive so don't bother . The shops are ritzy but a definite ticket on the must do list,5,
"Monumental hotel in Singapore. Great swimming pool, great appartments, great banquet close to the swimming pool. Best view to the skyscrapers. But i think management growing down with the servise to the guests. If was some things  part with price before one or two years ago, now not.... Good place for visit, for spend some nights, for trying the restaurant - but if the servise will be worst than now, was my last visit there.........if i payed so much money i look forward best servise. No say me - not possible, not possible , must pay more....",4,
"Ok, that is HUGE hotel, but if you are at Singapore, you shoud stay here for one night! The SkyPark is fabulous, you have to try it! We stayed at Club room with amazing view to the city, which was very spacious. Breakfast at the Club was a bit limited and very crowded all the time. Anything we asked for, it was immediately done..  So service was very quick. Waiting tome for check in and check out were long, even if you stay in club room or suite. This is definitely luxury and amazing hotel, but if you are looking for personalized service and peaceful stay, take a look elsewhere.",5,
I recently went on a family holiday to australia to see my brother and we stayed in singapore for a few days before to cut the journey up. We didnt stay here however we had to pay a visit! Oh wow. How beautiful?!! And no surprise with the added price tag (definitely out of my budget!) But we were taken on a tour to the top to the bar to have a look at the views. Unbelievable. It shows how beautiful singapore really is at day and night. If youve got the money treat yourself and stay even if its for a night but make sure you swim in the pool overlooking the city! If you havent this is a must do just to go and have a look! Absolutely breaktaking.,5,
"The best hotel ever!This is one of the places that i love most romantic and elegant It is a paradise the accommodations were just the best, super comfortable beds super clean and bathrooms had everything you need, so spacious also!. Views are breath taking!The infinity pool were just fantastic.A dream.",5,
My in-laws came by to visit both me and my wife from Malacca and we've decided to put them up in MBS. Service is really good. Rooms are really clean and well designed. Very spacious. Great view towards the sea.,4,
"As soon as we arrived and seen in person where we would be staying it was awesome, everything was perfect from walking in the door till walking out the door, only wished we stayed longer, and the rooftop pool was a highlight of the night with views of the city, and the sweet spot shop had so many delicious treats, can't say enough good things about this place as there wouldn't be enough room, maximum pleasure to be had when staying here from food to rooms to facilities offered, definitely worth revisiting again and again and again....loved it ",5,
"the most wanted stay in singapore, the room full books almost everytime and everyday, onestop entertainment area, shopping arcade, food, hotel, casino, exhibition hall, with a nice view marina's bay. the standard room is quite big..recomended place to stay with family",5,
"All in all an excellent choice.   There we some minor drawbacks. At first we got rooms in lower floors only, but were quickly transferred to 48th floor after checking with front desk. During the holidays the queue for check-in time and the breakfast in RISE restaurant were quite long. The options were either go earlier for breakfast or checkout the Sky57 buffet instead.",5,
"It is really nice to see the city and its gardens from the 57th floor! From the pool as well as from the rooms, the city view is impressive! Everything worked great for us, from the staff, to the hotel and the weather outside!",5,
Booked a room here and we were upgraded to suites. The room is huge and it is a separate bedroom and living area. Lovely bathroom with a stand alone tub overlooking the pretty towers in Merlion City. Best part of the stay is the infinity pool. There were so many people in the evening but we still enjoyed it very much.,4,
"We stayed for 2 nights at this amazing hotel and there is simply no other one that this can compare with. I reached the hotel quite early and when I checked in, the front desk reception saw that I was tired from the trip and he gave me my room at 10 am. Most hotels allow checking in between 12 to 2 pm. The hotel itself has spacious rooms even for the regular ones. The view drom all the rooms are magnificent, one facing the marina and the other side facing the Gardens by the Bay. The windows can be opened allowing you to clearly see the views. Access to the pool is strictly for hotel guests and you need your key card to gain access. This is one pool you need to swim in! It is a totally different feeling when you are swiming and instead of seeing buildings when you look up, you…",5,
This is amazing property & a landmark in Singapore. If in Singapore its a must visit on the list. The only place where casinos are legal in Singapore. The property is just WOW & pls go experience urself once if in singapore but its an expensive property.,5,
Excellent hotel. Breathtaking views! Expensive but worth to stay for special occasion. Overall was great experience. Great view from the room... bedding is very comfortable. I was impressed by the set up for the room size and decorations.,5,
"Iconic building dominates the skyline. Infinity roof top pool is spectacular. Friendly staff exceptional customer service. Lobby and reception is very busy and is more like a shopping mall than a high end hotel. Rooms are well appointed but not to a 5 star level. Bathrooms are not practical robe and towel hooks get wet by shower spray.   Caution hotel Does not honour rates booked through third party websites, additional charges and taxes are applied in addition to the pre-booked all inclusive rate.  A pleasant stay is guaranteed but this hotel is over priced.",4,
"This place is busy, bright and efficient.   The rooms are big and really well maintained.   Automatic curtain opening on entering the room was very clever.   Views are over the city or the bay.   Both options are interesting.   Breakfast in the lobby is excellent if a bit soulless.   Breakfast on floor 57 is more limited but quieter.   The pool on the roof is divided into 4 areas.   One area is exclusively for adults and one is best suited for little ones.   It is well thought out.   The casino is big and really Vegas style.   The staff try hard to make everything easy.   A great hotel if you like Vegas style.   We did!!  Subway is under the hotel making travel cheap and simple.",5,
I have wanted to stay at the MBS for a couple of years now. I stayed last week for one night ( pricey if your travelling alone) and what an absolute experience it was!  After checking in I ventured straight up to the pool. Totally wish I videoed my expression as the elevator doors opened. Absolutely stunning! I spent most of my time in / next to the pool and soaking in the view. Met some awesome people whilst staying here and ventured out to the bar that night. Totally recommend to any solo travellers as well. Best place to give travelling alone a go! ,5,
"Absolutely different hotel in Singapore I've been. Everywhere you look at was so luxurious . The view was so excellent and extremely wonderful. I was definitely impressed on the pool on top. Its so WOW!!! Most memorable experienced in Singapore. The food was so delectable from appetizer to dessert. Although It was expensive, its worth it.",5,
"We stayed at the MBS, as they call it, for just two nights. We didn't do much but hang out at the pool - the infinity pool! It was delicious! The eatery options in the hotel are a bit over priced but we really enjoyed Cu deTa, which is on the rooftop. The room we had was pleasant, the bed big and the bathroom spacious. And clean, clean, clean! We also took advantage of the wellness and spa services. The Thai massage is to die for. Over all we had a great time and would love to come back to MBS!",4,
"We stayed 2 nights and read lots of reviews before booking but no matter what was said we were staying anyway!  And we made the right decision....check in and out was a breeze no queues we were whizzed up to our room and given the low down and soon left to do some exploring.  Straight to the pool area ...guests only... For a Singapore sling.  Fabulous views, first class room with all the features you would expect from a 5 star resort.  One of the quietest rooms we've ever stayed in.  The pool is amazing sooo many sun loungers plenty of room for heaps of people, great pool side service easy to spend a couple of hours here people and city skyline watching.   We ate at one of the restaurants, good food very expensive and not necessary to do.  Heaps of great restaurants or food…",5,
Where to start ... I can't say anything bad about this place it is simply amazing! Pictures do not do this hotel and pool justice!! The room and bathroom are amazing so clean with everything you would ever need!! Great views over the city and garden by the bay! Beds are very comfy! Great stay with amazing room service!! The pool has amazing views over the city with nice bars around it! Lots of seating areas! Childrens and adult areas in the pool! 10/10 and will defiantly be back to visit again!! ,5,
"Our stay at this hotel was amazing. We were upgraded to a suite at Tower 2 on the 53rd floor , which if I am not mistaken only has 4 rooms plus the chairman suite. View is amazing - we were able to watch the laser/light show of the garden by the Bay from our veranda., we saw the Singapore eye and the Marina. Walking distance to the Esplanade and Garden by the Bay and  of course the  shopping mall which was like shopping at 5th avenue in NYC.The Infinity pool which my children loves so much was the main reason I booked this hotel  was the icing on the cake for our stay . Oh! i must not forget that when you stay you should try the Rise buffet . We had breakfast there and the food choices our so much, love all of it . The staff was so nice too . I already recommended this hotel to…",5,
"We stayed here for 2 nights on our honeymoon. Checkin was pretty quick and painless, we had booked a deluxe room and the honeymoon bonus which included a number of things, the hotel upgraded our room to the city view but as for all the other inclusions they told us we didn't book it even though our paperwork says so. Pretty disappointing from a 5 star hotel!   Location is great, there are shops, restaurants, casino and waterfront at your doorstep.   The rooms are nothing special at all, same as what you would get in a 3 or 4 star hotel, the shower pressure is terrible it took a long time to be able to wash the shampoo out of my hair. The views are fantastic though.  The pool has a fantastic view, however it was windy and the pool itself is freezing so you can't really enjoy it.…",3,
Marina Bay Sands  Perfect location; Epic rooftop;  Outstanding infrastructure;  Delighting culture; The food ... An ambrosia! Great service;  Comfortable rooms; Top knotch hotel in Singapoure!  Overall an awesome trip with an unforgettabble stay!!,5,
"This hotel places the heart of singapore bay.  Easy to access shopping center, gardens by the bay and subway.  The Receptionist was kind enough to give us high floor room because it was our honeymoon. View was amaging. we had good Room service. Free access banyantree gym and spa. the view in the gym was stunning but the gym wasn`t for true trainers.  Also their bar staffs don`t know how to make a singapore sling. Don`t make mistake like us.",4,
this 5 star hotel is superb with beautiful view  and services. I was given 2 free nights stay and special discounts for a further 3 nights stay. The swimming pool and gymnasium are excellent and would recommend friends to stay. The food at rise restaurant is buffet style are nice and fresh at 40% discount.,4,
"5 star service was very nice, room was luxuries with all the extra touches. Bathrobes, slippers, every thing operated by buttons next to the bed. Room was very comfy and warm feeling with amazing views. I booked the cheapest room yet still had great views from my 8th floor room. Now for the best bit, the rooftop pool with views in every direction. Surprisingly it wa not windy up there. Food from cafe up there was terrible but a coffee sitting in or around the pool was magic. One side is the pool the other side is a treed oasis with spas and sun baking beds.",5,
"This appears to be the Best Area in Singapore.....The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is spectacular and the centerpiece of this area which contains the best of shopping, scenery, the Singapore Arts Science center, Marina Bay Gardens and the Cadino. Restaurants and food courts are abundant offering all kinds of cuisine. Take stroll along the many fairways in side the Mall/hotel and along the river front. Beautiful....spectacular views.",5,
"We stayed here for one night as a splash out and it was worth it just for the view and the pool. The hotel room itself isn't the best that we've stayed in as a couple of things let it down: -shower pressure isn't good. -you have to pay for the films on the tv. I actually thought this was quite bad as I have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels that offer the entertainment packages for free.   Now for the positives:  - the view from the room is amazing, we stayed on floor 46. - the pool is incredible  -the prices within the marina bay sands are reasonable compared to outside restaurants and bars.  -the beds are super comfortable  -professional service  Overall very happy that we stayed here and it's worth the price you pay.",4,
We arrived a bit early on the day but the reception who was on duty that day (Mr.Chun morning shift on 5th March) was very accommodating and has arranged a room for us despite the early time (we were there around 13.30). His friendliness and service mind created a very good first impression. We were also impressed by the infinity pool and the room. The room was very spacious and the view of course was very stunning. It's definitely worth the money.,5,
"We stayed here for one night and it was well worth it for the price! We had a room on the 47th floor, with a sea facing view. The room was clean and comfortable. The best thing ever was the pool, but you have to fight for a lounger. Looking out over the Singapore skyline while having a swim is the best way to unwind!  Would definitely recommend this hotel, I would stay here again!",5,
Stayed one night for my 40th birthday. Had heard mixed reviews before booking but throughly enjoyed it. The pool is worth the stay on its own. Check in and check out was hassle free. The room was nice and comfortable.  Shopping centre attached to the hotel very nice to wander through.  ,5,
We spent a week here and it was amazing.  Had a city view room on a high floor and the lift going direct to the pool (which is good as you don't have to walk thru reception in wet togs and bad hair!!) The service was exceptional for such a large hotel.  The best time to go to the pool is very early or very late.  It is in a great position with the Marina Gardens just a short stroll over the connecting walkway.  Shopping centre connected by escalator. Could not fault this place.,5,
"We stayed one night here with high expectations. We arrived on a cruise ship and took a short cab ride to the hotel. It was early in the morning but the front desk was able to find me a room on the 47th floor overlooking the garden and the bay. The view alone was worth 5 stars. We loved it when we walked into our room and the curtains automatically  opened up to that view. The room was large with the latest amenities. The staff friendly and helpful. We toured the shops and restaurants in the shopping complex and chose some Korean food. We did not eat at the hotels restaurants. We had to check out at 4:30AM to catch our flight. Security helped us out side and into a waiting cab. A 5 star experience. Now, we did go up to the 57th floor and swim in the pool. Fantastic views of the…",5,
What can I really say about this place other than that's it's like the best. The service is great and the staff are excellent and very helpful. The room is just amazing and the views are to die for from our 50th floor room.  There is a huge mall connected to the hotel that has whatever you desire and also a casino. But of course the pool takes the cake. We spent a total of about 6 hours in the water it's just amazing.,5,
"Splashed out and stayed here for two nights recently - it's been on my list of things to do for some time - especially swimming in the infinity pool.  We had a great room on the 31st floor which was probably the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in.  We had a view over the Gardens by the Bay which is lit up beautifully at night.  I believe you pay a bit more for the city view rooms (Singapore has a great skyline) but unless you have your heart set on a city view room the alternative view is also very interesting.  Very comfortable bed, good bathroom and shower.  Rooms seem to have double glazing which helps with the noise coming from the freeway, even 31 floors up.  Staff at reception were very friendly.  The infinity pool is a real novelty and I went at a quiet time -…",5,
"I spent my last Christmas in 2014 within this property with my family.  It was really a great 2 Day 1 Night stay in Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.  Why Marina Bay Sands Singapore? First that come to our eyes is the infinity pool on the highest level of the building, overlooking the city of Singapore.  When we reached the property. It was in the evening - like 4ish, and the pool quite crowded by that time. - not a big fan of huge crowded... So, we went down to the shopping mall instead and decided to come early morning to the pool on the next day.  It's quite amusing, the shopping mall was like a one-stop-shopping where you can find everything you need there.  Done with shopping, we're looking for a nightlife and booze-up our mood to Ku-De-Ta Bar that located within the premises. …",5,
"This was my second stay here in Marina Bay sands, i stayed with my friend this time. we stayed for the city view for the first night n we ask to move to a higher level, so we got this 35th floor garden view. Our designed guest service Jia Wei really impressed me with small chat before we went out and the elephant and dog shaped towel surprise when we got back to our room. maybe  you did it to all the guest there but, still, we love it.",4,
"We have stayed 1 night in Marina Bay Sands just to see this hotel. It's one of the must see places in Singapur. Hotel has 3 towers, we have stayed in tower 2. Hotel has both sea view and skyscrapers view. But the most fascinating part of the stay was infinity pool The hotel has a pool above these 3 towers. Whole terrace looks like a boat (Titanic), there is also a night Club next to the pool. But the pool seems to approach infinity (the name comes from this feeling), don't miss it!",5,
"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands was the finale for a vacation, centered around a family cruise in November, last year. All three rooms which we occupied had excellent views, with well maintained ameneties. The infinity pool on the ""surf board"" is actually divided into three sections, requiring the swimmer to clamber over partially submerged partitions. All said and done, the view is definitely worth soaking in. The dining is good but not memorable. An amusing feature in Lobby 1, is a work of art by Israel Hadany, spread over a good deal of the seating area requiring the hotel to deploy staff to request their guests not to sit on it.",4,
"Yes, the Infinity Pool is primarily the main attraction here, but there are too many people to really enjoy the view and surroundings, and relax.   For certain, the hotel music at the pool is too loud and not conducive to relaxing (mostly up tempo pop/rock).    The hotel breakfast is expensive but very good.   Room service and house keeping was very attentive and good.   Gym is ok, but can do with more weights/equipment... not everyone who goes to the gym wants to go on treadmill and watch the view.     Would be hard to justify a return visit unless the rates are lower or include breakfast as the only real attraction is the pool.",4,
Stayed for 3 nighs.  decor was superb location ideal and service matched.  The only thing is that it is Singapore and everything comes at a price.  Food is most expensive in the countries I have visited and on par with Australia.  The street food stalla are cheaper but I have a stomach aversion to these. Still for a Short stay it is very High recommend. But do not go there for shopping much better shopping in Hong Kong or Asia in general ,5,
"Me and my wife stayed here for 1 night with our friends, we both got single standard rooms reserved, came here early to check in around 12pm. The room wasnt ready and they said it would probably be ready closer to 3pm. Came back at 3pm, they said its not ready but we got the penhouse suite for you, which should be ready in an hour. Which we happily accepted.   The penthouse suite (2 bedroom) was absolutley amazing, Huge private balcony with huge bathtubs and bathrooms. Just WOW!  Hotel staff if very friendly and the hotel itself is very top notch!  Pricey! Very Pricey! for anything in the hotel.",5,
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night before a cruise.  There was a special offer on for January and February which meant it was a similar price to other good hotels in Singapore.  We were particularly looking forward to using the infinity pool at the top of the hotel.  We found where we were supposed to check in (it wasn't obvious) and we were given a lovely room actually a suite with dining room, lounge, bedroom and two bathrooms overlooking the Gardens on the Bay which was lovely.  After unpacking we grabbed our swimsuits and headed up to the top floor.  This takes two elevators interestingly.  When we got there the only place to get changed was in the toilets.  The pool has a great view over the bay and very popular as you would expect, what we did not expect was the…",4,
Most certainly the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Huge place with amazing pool. Very clean and the employees are so nice. I had the view of the ocean and garden by the bay which was mind blowing.  Only down side was the buffet breakfast was very expensive and so was the laundry service.,5,
"We started our singapore swing by arriving early in the morning. Our check-in at the Marina Bay Sands went without a hitch then we retired to our room.  It was our first time to stay at this hotel and as i will always say ""wow! What a stylish well-appointed guest room"".  My very good first impression really set the mood for our stay.  Most important for me is the refilling of water bottles which our room comes standard with 2 bottles every day. Our bed was very comfortable and very sleep-inducing.  Come every morning our booking didn't come with meals but no problem as we arrive at the ground floor there is this lovely bakery named: Sweet Spot  (its going to be my next review) that we always take our breakfast.  Nearby is a mall where shops and good meals are served.  The hotel…",5,
"We were here two years ago with my family and ex-husband and we got a free room upgrade because we were newly weds. That was a nice touch. The room we had was spacious with magnificent view.   Since we were there for a relatives' wedding in Singapore, we didn't have much time to explore the hotel. I only peeked at the pool and went back down. Note that the lobby was very crowded with people as that was during the long Christmas holidays. The location is also good and there's a nice mall opposite the hotel. OK I managed to explore this part.   Checking-in and out took quite a while but we're glad we managed to stay at the VIP lobby and it was a bit more quiet and cosy there, with drinks and snacks. I wouldnt know how long those people at the other lobby had to wait. But overall,…",5,
"Stayed in MBS Tower 1 for 5 nights.   Get to hotel by taxi, took 30 mins and around 20SGD.  Arrived the lobby area, no staff is there to help me unload suitcases so i helped myself.  As i want to go inside for check in, i was stopped by a bellboy as he wants to take my suitcases and give me a ticket. However he was sidetracked by other guests so i stood there for another 5 mins before he can pass me the ticket.   Lobby area is quite chaotic, nothing like a 5 star hotel. More like a shopping mall fountain area.   Check in queueing was long, at least waited 20mins before i get to the check in desk.   Room was nice, i stayed on the 40th floor Premier Room with City View. City view room is bigger, without balcony and bay view is smaller but with a balcony. I dont have a particular…",4,
"Read plenty negative reviews before going to this hotel, but it was not that bad for me. I expect to have a slow check in/check out, I checked in at the thrid tower, it seems they did improve the front office service. The pool was super awesome, I went up there at both day time and night time, the view was extraordinary. The down side was the in room design, it was basically no design, but since I didn't really spend much time in the room, it was not that bad for me.",3,
"The security is so tight that if you do not bring your reservation # you cannot check in. If your spouse checks in first they will not tell you the room #, when you arrive, or confirm they are there. I spent 16 hours in the lobby trying to get into my room. No luck. My spouse finally sent an email to my phone with the room #. They still would not give me a key to get in the elevator. What a nightmare.",1,
"The hotel is pretty amazing. Its design presents plenty of photo opportunities and its easily accessed from the city or Sentosa. It was very busy when we were there which is understandable as its not only a hotel but a casino, it has that rooftop pool and is close to the gardens by the bay. Worth seeing.",4,
"This is by far THE best hotel i've ever stayed in.The service was great, room was very large (almost too large?) but the hero by far, was the SkyDeck. Stay here! It was an amazing experience, One I hope to enjoy again soon.",5,
"Have stayed at MBS for a couple of night before CNY and I must say that although the room looks ok for what it is, the service is this place is non exciting. the staff want to do it right, you can feel that they have been well trained but they are just lost... too many people around this place, too many guests to look after, too much of everything! I would never expect a personalize service for this type of massive properties but the  express check in and check out and all the fast fast service they want to provide to make the staff life easier it remain me to be at the airport. for a moment I thought my boarding gate was going to be announce... price wise is expensive but not so much, $ 35 dollars for a club sandwich is a bit too extreme as the sandwich presentation is not even…",3,
"First of all the hotel is very expensive. There are many qualities, including the rooms, the view and the swimming pool at the top of the building. But we must mention some shortcomings: the hotel is as packed as an airport, consequently you would have to stand in line to do the check in and to let in into the breakfast.  There is not a single couch in the lobby where to sit down, which is unbelievable for a hotel. Last, the restaurants and even the lobby offer only Asian food, and we find this a big discomfort.",3,
"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in a premier room which we had pre-booked online. Our experience at check-in was substandard as the front desk had no record of our prepayment and wanted to take a deposit for amounts we had already paid. The room itself was spacious, modern and had nice views over the Gardens by the Bay. The highlight of hotel however is without doubt the pool which has some fantastic views of the city; there is also an adults-only section which is monitored throughout the day. The hotel competes with premium-end accommodation in the city however because it is so big and part of the casino, there are constantly large volumes of people in common areas and queues for the front desk, concierge and restaurants. As a result, it lacks the personalised experience…",4,
"Everything you read about this hotel is true. Cocktails in the adults only area on the rooftop - nothing better. Stayed for 3 nights, wish it was longer. Splurged a little at the shops. Walked to the MRT when wanting to go out and explore. I'll be be back MBS!",5,
"An extraordinary amazing place, situated near the best spots of Singapore! Great stuff, amazing food and beauthifull rooms. I've spent there one week and can't find a single  bad word. I will definitely visit this place again if I found myself in Singapore again. Recommend it to everyone! Thanks for amazing time!",5,
The hotel and the complex is amazing. It's the main attraction in Singapore and it's worthy to stay at least one night there. The infinity pool is incredible both day and night. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and the room was already available so we could enter before planned. The room was great and the people were very professional. It's also great to have a shopping mall with restaurants there. It's a must in Singapore!,5,
"i choose marina bay sand to celebrate my mom's birthday. Everything was good from check-in, out, very professional. Pick up a room on floor 42 with city view was fantastic. I can rate the room at 5 out of 5, very clean, everything you need it just there. The infinity pool had spectacular view but i love the jacuzzi pool more, so nice and relaxation. However, there was a negative point in concierge service when I tried to ask some advices but they seem like too busy to answer and only give the map, then whatever. The hotel itself make me feel like I'm staying in the factory, too crowd, too noise everywhere, always a ton of people standing in the lobby. In overall, its quite good and I'm happy.",4,
"We stayed in the hotel for a few nights in June and still like reminiscing. Very much to our surprise on arrival we received a free upgrade to a room on the 55th floor with view to the city. The view from the room was simply amazing. The room itself was fantastic, too. Also of course the infinity pool is famous for a reason. It's not overcrowded, and sitting there drinking a fresh coconut or a beer whilst enjoying the view after an exciting day exploring the city was perfection. Would love to come back again!",5,
"Spent one night at the hotel and 24 hours in the Marine Bay complex. There are so much to do here, that you can easily spend the whole weekend here. On the plus side, the hotel is gorgeous with fantastic views and the skypark pool is pretty awesome. On the minus side, this is a huge hotel, and therefore crowds and line ups are the reality. Could use the Disney touch here on crowd management.",4,
Will be attending a conference held at the MBS in March. Booked my room on the MBS website and shortly after my wife found a lower price on Orbitz. I took the screenshots and submitted a Lowest price guarantee request. Was contacted via email the next day saying that the request was denied due to Orbitz being a Unpublished Rate. Funny since it is publicly viewable. Wife urged me to submit another screenshot showing rates not being logged into my account. I did and received back the response that they wont accept it either. Whats the point in having the guarantee if you wont accept claims? I verified that their second reason wasn't listed in the terms and conditions and called to speak to someone in reservations. Took many calls to finally reach someone and was told I couldn't…,1,
"Perks: The hotel is famous for its awesome architecture and for its enormous rooftop swimming pool. The latter is truly a sensation: It commands a fantastic view of the city. This alone would make a stay at the hotel worthwhile. Yet since just about every guest feels this way about it, the pool is filled to capacity by afternoon. Tip: You should go early and secure a good spot for yourself. The place is actually a city in microcosm more than a hotel. There is a vast number of stores, restaurants and other units beneath the hotel, making it virtually unnecessary to ever leave the hotel. Everything is available on the premises. To me, it is always important to have a good gym. The gym in this hotel is far better than what you are used to from other hotels. There is also a great…",4,
"This hotel is totally over priced for the service and room you get. At the same price or even lower you could enjoy the service from St. Regis Singapore which has a better room and bed.  If my father wasn't able to get free night we won't spend our money to stay in this hotel.  But I have to give some justice to this hotel, it's a good experience to stay for one night in this hotel to enjoy the night view of Singapore and they probably have the best view for an infinity pool!!",3,
Wow wow wow is my conclusion  Spectacular view and what an amazing design way to let the public feel when one is up there the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sand structure. Bravo again Singapore for making the best that you can always. ,5,
"I recently stayed for a second time at this resort but unfortunately this time it was not as pleasant as the first.  Everything seemed really expensive and I was not happy that I had to pay extra for fresh milk to be delivered to my room so that I could make a cup of tea.  My stay also coincided with the Chinese New Year and as such the hotel was extremely busy.  The Infinity Pool which should be a great place to relax, swim and enjoy a beverage was so crowded,  it was just very unpleasant.  The rooms/suites are very very spacious and well appointed.  There a numerous dining options, The Infinity Bar and Alfresco on Level 57 and The Rise on the ground floor being my favourites.  This is definitely a luxury destination and I do recommend it if you have something special to…",3,
"The view of the Marina Bay from the top floor rooms is amazing breathtaking Necessarily have insisted at reception for a room at or above the 40th floor . The room is very spacious and airy equipped with everything necessary . But clearly infinity pool is the top attraction at this hotel . Water pretty cool but the view port is insane . skyscrapers that are flush with you make you feel their master , but also the view from heated Jacuzzi over the  Gardens by the Bay  is priceless . A weakness is brought hustle and agitation and hundreds of clients or even tens of visitors who are everywhere and take pictures from the  reception to the terrace suspended 200 meters above the Marina Bay or Gardens by the Bay . Location of the hotel is excellent subway 2 minutes . In the hotel…",5,
It's was my 2nd time to stay here and I was disappointed  because there were so many people in the pool. It's now more strict you have to pay like 70 sgd for an extra key card. That should be like free or something. There was also no free breakfast. Still the service was good. The location is fine,3,
Awesome views will greet you . The line moves quickly as you buy your tickets to ride to the top of tower 3. Great time to take pictures of the beautiful city or see the light show.,5,
"Stayed at this property quite a few times. What I love is the view, whether one is facing the city or the sea, and the sheer size of the rooms. Its the biggest rooms one can find at any mainstream hotel in a large city.  The pool on the 57th floor is one of the best infinity pools one can find, though it does get crowded at times. Its a myriad bunch of guests one finds at this hotel... honeymooners, traditional chinese seniors who've flown down just to gamble, families on vacation and the occassional business traveller. Business travellers will get a bit taken aback by the overall casual atmosphere of the place, though its a good place for office off-sites / conferences.",4,
If you want luxury experience obviously in Singapore marina bay sands is the first option and roof top swimming pool is must to go only allowed for guest...  And must visit id kudeta bar on roof top at 56th floor its a superb experience ,5,
The hotel itself is lovely offering great views ( Skypark ) however found the rooms themselves nothing exciting. I thought for what the average nightly rate was the rooms would offer more or be abit more luxurious. A bonus was all the access to hundreds of shops / malls and the trainline for easy access through Singapoore. Club Lounge is a must.,3,
"Most people come to Marina Bay Sands for their pool. This hotel is similar to any other large high-end hotel. Aside from the infinity pool, this hotel is no different than the massive hotels you have in Las Vegas. Everything in the hotel seems very grand and luxurious. The park next to the hotel is neat and quite manicured. If you're looking for a natural forest, it's not really that kind of forest. It's quite man-made, but still great to see. If you're a bucket list item traveler, this hotel will likely be one of the places you want to stay at at least for a night.  The staff is very well organized and there is a lot of staff members to help all the guests coming in and out of the hotel. From the moment you get out of your cab to when you check in, the staff is very efficient.…",4,
"It's a good hangout place where you will find a lot of young crowd. The laser show at Marina Bay Sands along with the fountain show is very pretty, must see!",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay just one night.  It is a pricey place to stay, but only those who stay can access the hotel top pool and hot tubs.  We booked the hotel through Orbitz and used our Orbitz dollars to get the price down to about $375 for the one night.  It is an amazing place - so much to see and do. They let you keep your room keys as souvenirs. You could probably stay there a week and not take in all there was to do.  The Marina Bay Sands Resort includes, the Sands Sky Park, The Hotel, the ArtScience Museum, MasterCard Theaters, Crystal Pavilions, the Casino, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, Sands Expo and Convention Center and the Event Plaza.  There is also walkways to the Marina Bay gardens, the Helix walk way etc. Sensory overload for sure.  You can get to the…",5,
"Visited, here to see this famous hotel , and. Have to say big is not beautiful , as walking in saw non hotel staff drinking tea behind reception , hotel staff look up , don't smile the look down again , lobby is like a railway station with guests allowed to walk around with bathroom robes , and very few staff to answer questions and when they do ... Unclear answers ",2,
"This is a 'must see'.  The endless pool and rooftop are something to remember.  If you have vertigo or height fears, this is not for you.  If not, then certainly make sure you get here even if you only go to dine and have a drink on the rooftop.",5,
"Spectacular but not as luxury as expected (at least by myself). Great architecture, impressive civil engineering. Great views from most of the rooms. The Casino not the greatest as compared to the best (Las Vegas, Macau). The biggest attraction is skypark: guests only pool at the roof, build on top of three hotel towers. I recommend",4,
"Stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for one night, before joining a cruise. Check in: Arrived around 14.45 to tower 1 reception and check in was friendly and quickly made. Got a lovely room at the 30th floor in the 3rd tower.  Room: Wonderful spacious room, with a lovely view over the bay.  Bed was very comfortable to sleep in, and air conditioning was efficient and quiet. Bath room was large and well disposed with good toiletries.   Breakfast: Had breakfast at Sky on 57, and even if it was a bit pricey, it was one of the best hotel breakfasts I ever have had, the buffet selection is much larger than you can gather from their description,   freshly squeezed orange juice, other kinds of juices (blueberry/raspberry was wonderful), good selection of breads, bacon etc. As hot side orders…",5,
"The most luxurious hotel, impressive, rooms are clean and spacious, its roof is itself a tourist, and yet, in the end, there's something I was missing, something hard to define, perhaps a little bit of ""home"". When I was staying in a hotel, I want to feel that during my stay there, I found a kind of home, whether it's day or whether a longer period. And here the hotel can be said that has it all, but one thing it does not; it has no sense of warmth and home. Begin by standing in a long queue for registration, continues masses of people walking around between you throughout the hotel, tourist masses of immigrants continues hotel roof to look and photograph the landscape and while doing so they photos of you while you are looking for privacy and some quiet in enjoying the pool.…",4,
"For our 3 night stay in Singapore we decided to treat us for a stay at the MBS- we wanted to know what the hype is all about and see and swim in that infitity pool. Check-In had a bit of a queues, however, we got lucky and were pulled out and escorted to a VIP check-in. Our reservation could not be found at first (was my mistake) and for the long waiting the nice guy at reception (Stanley, he was very professional) gave us an upgrade to a suite- which was very nice of him! The room was spacious and very clean- for one night we could not make use of it all. The decor and its interior were nothing fancy- it more seemed like one of those american type hotels. The pool area is indeed spectacular and the view is simply amazing. Unfortunately, we picked a day with rain and stronger…",3,
"check in very slow, slow, slow.n Feel like you are at the tax department.    Only accept a room on higher levels, lower levels are awful with highway view.  Room very average.  Main entrance interesting but like a train station.  Pool and bar fantastics but very busy.  Would not stay again but definitely go back to the bar.",3,
Must stop by on a visit to Singapore..awesome view from restaurants such as Ku de ta and  Level 33. Beautiful by day and awesome by night!,4,
"Marina Bay Sands is one of the best hotels available in Singapore. The rooms were good, not as spacious as other hotels I have stayed in. The bathroom was very clean and well decorated. However, the shower was not very impressive, lacking pressure. The staff were very helpful in all aspects. Obviously the main attraction for me was the infinity pool. It was a breathtaking sight looking over Marina Bay onto the Singapore Skyline. Well worth a stay for a night, but not necessary to stay there for your whole time in Singapore.",5,
We only stayed for one night and it was great! We had a beautiful view and the room was spacious. Will definately come back.,4,
"This hotel is impressive as soon as you see it, which is why we went to stay. The staff at check in were very helpful as we had 5 rooms booked for family. Not all of us were there at the one time and they were more than happy to get us sorted with rooms all on the same floor. The views from the rooms are amazing, whichever side of the hotel you are on.  The pool is probably one of the highlights, it does get busy. There is an adults only area which is nice and you can eat and have drinks by the pool if you want. You are also allowed to take food up to the pool area, we took coffee and muffins for breakfast to enjoy the view and pool at a time which is a bit quieter.",5,
"Reading some reviews I was worried about how busy it would be, with over 2500 rooms, it is a big place.  We arrived around 1800 - waited at check in for Club Rooms, we were spotted by staff who took us to VIP check in, a great start.  Staff are very nice and happy to chat away. Club Room Tower 2 level 38.  Was worried when I saw connecting room, seems they all like this, I really dont like connecting rooms as you always get noise, but here it seemed to be okay.  Large room with great view of city - looks like garden view side have balconies, city rooms dont.  we used lounge, one of best I have been to.  Met at door and taken to table, lots of staff on hand to offer drinks, happy hour 1700-1900 with great choice food.  I did think was bit strange lounge shut at 1900, I would…",4,
"MBS is a self contained hotel where you can't quite tell that you are in another country. It has the casino, the amazing infinity pool, luxury shops, bars and dining from the low to the high end. The view is amazing and the rooms are beautiful. Easy access to the Gardens by the Bay.  However it is a large hotel and doesn't present the Singapore charm like other hotels. worth the visit if for the infinity pool alone.",4,
The room was not so great compared to the same rate hotel in SA. My gf and I spent 3 weeks travelling in SA and found out that this hotel was not worth the price. Btw the view from my room and pool was so amazing since this hotel located in the center of the city.,4,
We Loved everything about our stay.There were Chocolate coated strawberries and a beautiful honeymoon swan on the bed. Loveeeeeeed the pool..but the water ought to be at a warmer temperature. Perfect hotel for honeymoon and family goers alike..,5,
"This hotel is as incredible as it looks from the outside! Absolutely stunning. Very close to all of singapore downtown and the best of the best. The infinity pool on the rooftop ship is probably the best pool of the world, at least with the most spectacular view over this amazing city",5,
"Probable just to try one night stay at Marina Bay Sands is good enough, because the price is very expensive. At least by staying there once , you get to swim at the magnificent roof top swimming pool, 57th floor. The room was quite big, and luxury, still in immaculate condition, being a new hotel. The breakfast was average. Service was not like a five star hotel, more like a factory service, serving too many people.",4,
"Planned a 3 day visit to Spore with my sister. Highlight was the Marina Bay Sands Resort. The sound & light show was impressive. So too was the effect of the water whirlpool inside the Marina Bay Sands building before exiting the entrance to watch the sound & light show by the bay. Check the Marina by the Bay Sound @ Light Show timetable on the Marina Bay Sands website so as not to miss the show. Superb architecture & wonderful night views of Spore skyline & surrounding bulidings. A must see during your visit to Spore. Nice foodcourt with resonavle prices. For the high end celebrity restaurants,eg. Waku Ghin (japanese), expect to pay Sing $500 each for a 10 course degustation menu. Impressive pic of the casino taken from the restaurant level.",5,
A friend and I booked in from the 13-15th feb. Check in was quick. I did expect a large queue but there was none. $450 per night bought us a twin room on the 6th floor. Loved the floor to ceiling windows and remote controlled curtains. I was disappointed that we were only given 2 complimentary bottles of water each. It was a bit annoying having to produce our key cards every time to access the sky park and pool. All in all a pleasant stay. ,3,
"We stayed here just one night and enjoyed the main attraction, its swimming pool on the 57 th floor. The views are great and the photos are unbelievable. Super! Once in your life it is great to stay here and enjoy it. Everything around is very expensive, though. On the other hand, if you want to use the metro, it is very comfortable and you have just to use the escalator and go down. There is a big food court in the shopping mall with a great variety of foods.",5,
"the main attraction of the hotel is of course the famous infinity pool at the top of its 3 hotel towers, which can only be used by its hotel guests.  we booked the room online and checked in effortlessly was offered a room on a high floor with views of Gardens by the bay.   we got a shuttle bus to the hotel and as soon as we got off people helped with our bags and offered to bring it up to our rooms once we had checked in. the bags arrived promptly after we did in our room. we later found it would have been cheaper if we got a taxi to the hotel instead of the shuttle bus. so going back to the airport we caught a taxi.  the room was spacious and filled with light. there was also a balcony to admire the view from.  the pool was busy all day but open till late. everyone had their…",5,
"Stay here only if you go gambling at the casino or if you want to go swimming at the pool on the roof top.  Otherwise, it is an overpriced stay.   Room service is so bad, it takes 45-60 mins to be served anything from the room service menu. Water and ice request took 30 mins to arrive!  Besides the casino and rooftop pool there is literally no other facility for family members or children.   As such, room price is over the top for mediocre service and overall experience.",2,
"Didn't stay in the hotel, but did manage to get up to the Cheese Bar/Chocolate Bar/Wine Bar on the famous roof. Splendid food, memorable wine list, and the views of the city and particularly the harbour are remarkable. The definition of ""world class"".",4,
"We stayed Dec 30, 2014.  They were sold out (fortunately) for New Years so we only stayed one night.  Was extremely expensive and we booked a suite to make sure we got a good room.  They didn't give us a suite and it was a pain to change rooms but they eventually gave us what we paid for.  The infinity pool was freezing cold- why spend all that money on a pool and not put in a heater?  It does make for great pics on your vacation but know if you are there in cooler temps you will be freezing in that pool.  The nice thing was it wasn't crowded as everyone was too afraid to brace the cold waters.  The clientele are not exactly the classiest people in the world, and the hotel seems to know how to cater to them.  I'm glad we stayed, but one night at those prices was enough. …",3,
"We absolutely loved it! I thought the building structurally was phenomenal and the infinity pool at the top had amazing views day and night. We stayed one night and think that is plenty to maximise the full experience, our room was on the 50th floor and had an amazing view! The poolside service was fab, and check in and check out was quick, we didn't experience the long queues everyone mentions in their reviews, and a lot people comment on the rooms being ok, but you go to this hotel because of the pool! Moreover there were plenty of sun beds available, so you don't need to worry about getting a good spot and part of the pool is sectioned of adults only, which I thought was nice to. Moreover they have the best jacuzzis at the top on the other side of the pool with amazing views.…",5,
One of the finest building in Singapore which has lots of great clubs to visit. Have liked the view from the 55th floor is amazing.,5,
"I am sure many people finds this big (2.500+ rooms) hotel wonderful. There are many great features at this hotel. Like the gigantic roof top pool, fast elevators and nice rooms with great views (like you see at most big hotels).  But this place is not for me. Stayed here for one night and felt like it was one big anonymous money machine with no soul - what so ever. For me this place is not luxury. And if you - like me - prefer that personal touch that you eg. find in small hotels then look somewhere else. You won't find it here. I actually felt like I was staying at an airport or big railway station. The atmosphere with the many people felt the same.  When I was a the rooftop pool I enjoyed the view, but the atmosphere was just strange. Most people ran around taking selfies of…",3,
This is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore. The sheer indulgence of the architecture and size of the building alone is mind boggling. Such state of the art design and variety of shops and restaurants. We sat a took in the ambience before exploring the restaurant and shops. Worth staying even just 1 night to take in the magnificent view.,5,
"Stay in MBS 3 days for attending one conference. 1st night they gave me 6th floor face Marina Bay Garden, but the highway is very noise, wake up several times during the night. So lucky tomorrow hotel gave me a higher floor room, no noise and nice view to see the garden. The hotel has casino, and lots of shops and good restaurant. I didn't leave the hotel for 3 days, but have different nice lunch and dinner. Good choice include: Sky on 57, Mozza include Pizza and Osteria dinner, delicious. CUT has very high quality steak.  The roof swimming pool is very special, and good view. The only problem is too crowed, from morning to night. Most of people are selfie instead of swim and relax. Overall, MBS is good for vocation, but not properly for business trip. Check in and out always…",4,
"City in a hotel!!. Shopping, Entertainment, Extensive dining options, Casino, INFINITY POOL & SKY PARK ( highlight of the hotel)...... What else can one ask for?  We stayed for 2 nights and spent most of the time in the hotel. Behind the hotel is Gardens by the bay - must visit. Rooftop swimming pool - must visit. OK, rooms are standard and comparable with any 4-star hotel room.  We definitely got a lovely room on the 30th floor with bayview and could spend hours staring at the sea and the surrounding greenery. Bayfront MRT station is accessible from the hotel and you can reach anywhere in Singapore on MRT. This is very convenient. Great place to stay.",5,
"A truly awesome building to see across the city skyline. It did not disappoint when we went to visit. Although the shops are extremely pricey the restaurants in the mall did seem to bad. It was a great place to sit in the bar and people watch. Drinks, service and food were very good and we enjoyed the whole experience. Unfortunately we run out of time to visit the top! Hopefully next time.",5,
"Hi, I stayed at Marina Sands. The rooms are okay, but for this price you expect a bit more than what you get at any Holiday Inn. The service is so bad it is ridiculous.  I complained several times without success.  Internet was really bad, TV service did not work properly etc.   Breakfast was not included and when I went down I realized they charged 42 S$ for a simple breakfast buffet.   Cannot not recommend this hotel to anyone.  It is overpriced and the service is extremely bad.",2,
"Marina Bay Sands is an amazing 5 star property with incredible service, fabulous views, comfortable and luxurious room and of course, the famous infinity pool. This property is huge with three towers, restaurants and shopping mall all within the precinct. Close to the convention centre, this is a popular hotel for conference groups, families and holiday makers. A must is a walk to the gardens which overlook the hotel.",5,
"luxury shopping mall. High end brands all new arrivals, best shopping mall for businessmen I guess.  Very nice food court, variety of food, and reasonable prices. Very nice casino in the shopping  mall (free entry for foreign) locals have to pay a $100 but always over crowded at night.   Must see while you in singapore.",5,
"For all of the hype that this place gets the rooms are just normal rooms.  Don’t stay here if you are expecting some fancy room.  I have been in many hotels with much nicer rooms.  For example, the Conrad across the bridge from the Marina Bay Sands has more luxury rooms than here.  In my opinion the only justification to paying the extra money to stay here is if you want to utilize the Sky Park & Infinity Pool.  That part is a lot of fun but you have to be a guest to access the pool.  The service was not very good.  I arrived at 4AM and they only had one person working the front desk.  I had to wait 45-minutes in-line to check-in.",3,
Marina Bay Sand Hotel was spectacular. Out of this world architecture. The only negative experience - the trip to the top floor was not free.,4,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for two nights after a 5 night cruise out of Singapore.  What luxury.  The service was exceptional - from the checkin staff (special mention of Michael) to the pool boys, everyone was polite and attentive.  Food and drinks are on the expensive side but we expected this.  We were disappointed that the infinity pool closes at 11pm.  We could have sat up there all night.  It's just breathtaking.  Our only disappointment was that our toilet blocked on the last night and overflowed.  We mentioned this to the staff at check out but no compensation was given.",5,
"The whole experience with this hotel was absolutely amazing! Starting with the huge rooms, the view, and the rooftop park and swimming pool. The hotel is just across the street from a huge shopping center and just few steps away from Marina Gardens by the bay, wich is a must to see if you are in Singapore",5,
Overseeing Singapore city view at 55th stores high dipping in the infinity pool... What's more to say about this experience except fantastic !,5,
"Stayed here for 5 days during confrence in NUS. Room was great, clean and stylish. Elevator great speed but enoying cardreader. There is three thing that I was not so happy with. Not happy with the free internet that you have to log into every 24 hour. It was slow. You could pay for faster, but I think that should have been included. Breakfast were far to crowded and to many lines. Food was ok (except fried eggs that was not finished). They need to find a way to make better capasity. Resultet on my not going for breakfast. Turnout there is a way around it though. You can order to the room for the same price as i costs to dine in the collective area. Last thing was that on the day of going home alle of my conferance went hime late in the evening since we were going back to…",4,
"People have often complained about the rooms not being great, but with the roof top pool the rooms dont matter. We stayed one night and loved it. The roof top pool is cold so be warned but the views make up for this. The views from the room are spectacular too. Loved the hotel- simply amazing.",5,
Wonderful upmarket mall.   Probably too expensive for most of us but good to visit and see how the other half spend!,5,
"A much anticipated family celebration came together beautifully at this hotel. Hotel staff catered for all of our needs in both a professional and friendly manner. Only complaint was at Skybar on Friday evening after dinner. In order to be seated at a table we had to agree to purchase at least 2 bottles of champagne....  This would have happened without feeling that we were  'bullied' into it!  Apparently the tables are for those who patronise the Nightclub!  But as 9 of us were guests at the hotel, 7 staying for 2/3 nights I think that this should be taken into consideration!  ",4,
"I dont think i need to talk about how beautiful the hotel is and the lovely views. When we went to Singapore we decided to stay for a day at this hotel since we could not afford it for a week and we definitely wanted to be experience the infinity pool. I must say it was a beautiful experience right from check in where we were upgraded to a suite which had the view of the Gardens by the bay. We almost did not expect to get any vegetarian Indian food since it was past lunch time and veg indian food was tough to find anyways in the city but not only was the food available we had decent choice. The service staff was very friendly which in my opinion is the real differentiator  because the hotel is the same room, bed, amenities etc.  We tried the dinner buffet which was so huge we…",5,
"The most amazing architecture, great rooms, fantastic pool. But the lobby is reminiscent of a train station. It is so busy with passers-by tourists and others who are not staying in the hotel that the charm and appeal is lost at check in. The suspended lobby bar is beautifully designed but it absorbs all the noise from those who roam and amble around the train station. The queue for checking is/out is longer than a queue to buy an MRT ticket. Magnificent structure and wonderful location. Great rooms but that lobby leaves me wanting to check-in at the Raffles hotel.",3,
The most iconic view of Singapore now. Please come and book yourself a table at the restaurant there for drinks.,5,
"Watched. The performance by west end group ""Cats"" which was great. Booking was easy and good experience.",4,
"On a third visit to Singapore we decided to stay in Marina Bay Sands for  one night, purely for the experience! I would highly reccomend it for a short stay although I can understand that after a couple of nights, you may become tired of the constant hubbub of the HUGE lobby and waiting times for the lifts! The room was excellent and the view over Clarke Quay superb, particularly at night. The hotel is easily accessible to the adjacent shopping mall (I would highly reccomend visiting purely due to the 'river' inside!) and the near by museum. The most incredible experience is of course the famous infinity pool, which during the day does resemble a public swimming pool, so prepare to fight to the death for a sunbed! However the view does distract and you cannot ignore the…",4,
"This hotel is one of a kind, grate view, good service, nice and clean, good breakfast, gym, sauna and pool on the roof, I just loved the whole package☺ Close to everything like the food court, huge shopping center, river........ ........... ",5,
"I arrived in  a taxi and no one assisted me with my luggage  secondly, the treatment I receive depends on who I am with. If i am with a caucasian colleague, I get all the greets and hellos. They did not even check me when I was going back to my room however if I am by myself, the attitude of the staffs are totally different.   Lobby is packed with people, guest and non guests. Taxi queues are horrible. I returned to my room at 4 and room service not done.   View is good, bathroom is huge and everything else is overrated.",2,
"Nice hotel ,but definitely average if there was no pool with fascinating view and great shopping mall in same complex. We wait half hour at check in , room was very small for 5 star hotel,but when you go to swimming pool and see view on Marina Bay you gonna forget about everything else .",4,
"We have stayed at Marina Bay Sands before but decided this time to upgrade to a Club Room with City View. We weren't disappointed! We were located in Tower 2, and the view from the 40th floor looking out over Clarke Quay was amazing. The room was spacious and comes with access to the Club on the 55th floor. Full buffet breakfast is included along with afternoon tea, and drinks and canapés until 7pm in the evening. Access to the Sky Park and pool is included with your room and it is definitely worth spending some time up there. The staff at the hotel were great and would thoroughly recommend spending a bit more to upgrade to the Club Room experience.",5,
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights for our 10th wedding anniversary. We had a city view room with club access on the 46th floor. The room was spectacular - huge room, amazing views, beautiful bathroom. Very clean and quiet. The club is great - really takes away the need to buy food anywhere else. Staff in the club were fabulous, really unable to fault the service. Food is of great quality too. It is however always very busy, and can get quite noisy especially when there are a lot of children up there. The skypark and pool area is quite spectacular but there is a big ""but..."" With over 2000 rooms, this hotel is very very busy and this extends to the pool area. Don't expect any peace and quiet. This is by no means a relaxing experience. There are adults and children, noise,…",4,
Money makes many things. Highest attraction in Singapore. They will welcome tourists without any entry fee for casino. Luxury with leisure. Play the world's casino. One of the best attractions of Singapore. Don't miss it.. ,5,
"Marina bay was beyond amazing. No words can describe it. The hotel room was huge, felt like it was almost as big as my house. The pool area and bar upstairs was breathtaking especially at sunset. The pool is what makes the hotel. The only downfall I had was that there could only be 2 adults in a room at any one time and for us we had my partner and I then my step daughter who had just turned 18 at the time, so we had to get 2 rooms but the place is a must see and stay.",5,
"It's a beautiful hotel, lovely building, the pool is amazing but it's kind of like they built it and now don't know how to manage the people that come. We stayed one night to experience the pool but won't go back as the service does not live up to a five star standard. We were ignored on alighting from the taxi and were not offered assistance as we passed the bellhop desk.The counter and housekeeping staff could not manage simple requests like a pre-booked baby crib. On the fourth attempt, they said they'd call back if they had one free - a ridiculous situation. Also, as a pet peeve, I hate pre stocked fridges which charge you as soon as you move something. Guests prefer to be able to use the fridge!",3,
Negative: The worst customer service at the front desk I've ever experienced. The hotel in general makes you fell like you're going through customs check all day long. If you're not a preferred gambling member they treat you like crap and try to add things to your bill. They really don't want repeating customers at this hotel. The standard is about the same as a 3/4 star. The room is not sound proff at all. Expect to be woken up early. Wi-fi cuts you off every 2 hours or so.  Positive: Great bed. Great room service staff. Famous for it's beautiful pool area at the top (although it's always full and you're packed liked sardines)  All in all the total experience does not even come close to matching the price. Ripp off! Book a luxury hotel with a view of the Marina Bay Sands.. AT…,1,
"We arrived there 2 hours early and was given an early check in. There we lots of people lining up to check in but even though you had to wait the waiters there have you free drinks (juice and water). Our room was very spacious however the balcony planter box had several cigarette butts lying around. It kinda put us off the amazing scenery we were given. The room service telephone people were also very polite and understanding when we asked for an extra towel. However you have a wait a little while for your item to arrive because the size of the hotel is massive. The infinity pool was also breath taking. We went there when it was overcast and sprinkling abit which made it a little cooler and harder to enjoy the pool. Overall it is clean, spacious, in a good location with a mall…",4,
"We booked Marina Bay to gain access to the famous cantilevered pool. The staff were extremely friendly and upgraded our room on arrival which meant we were on the 42nd floor with city views. A great way to see all of Singapore CBD! We had a sunset swim in the pool and then a quick walk over to the Marina Bay gardens to see the beautiful conservatories and the amazing trees. The Marina Bay area is a little isolated from the more atmospheric and traditional parts of Singapore but it was easy enough to grab a cab and visit other places. Nice rooms, comfortable beds. Easy place to stay when you're in transit.",5,
"Make sure your room has a city view (NOT to the container Harbour and highway) and check out the top floor pool and bar at sunset. We had a lightning storm come in, or rather come trough! Spectacular unforgettable sight of Singapore.",4,
Great hotel for the novelty of the infinity pool.  Very impersonal due to the size of the hotel.  We stayed in Tower 1 - family of 5 needed 2 rooms.  No complaints really - asked for the mini bar to be cleared and we were told we needed to pay SING $10 for a bar fridge - cash only.   Not a problem for us but would've been good if the hotel could've cleared the fridge for us to use.  Glad we stayed for 2 nights but won't be rushing back.,5,
"Our stay at marina bay sands couldn't have started off any better, when we got a free upgrade to the chairman suite. We had two deluxe rooms with 5 guys, and they decided to give us a free upgrade and boy was it amazing!   The pool looks exactly how it looks in the photos, and the whole complex is just amazing.   Not sure what else to say but... box ticked!",5,
"We got a Marina Suit at MBS on Valentine's Day. I wanted to arrange a surprise proposal for my gf. I engaged the butler service and I have to say their service was exceptional. Sam very prompt in returning my enquires and I received a lot of support from him. Sam assigned Tijen to assist us during our stay here and he enthusiatically aided me in the surprise proposal. He arranged a Limousine to pick up my gf and ushered her to a SPA treat at Banyan Tree SPA to keep her occupied while I was busy with the preparation. I prepared a gown for my gf to wear for the night, and Tijen took the initiative to dry clean her gown and have it ready for her right after her SPA. The staff and Tijen timed the gown and the teaser bouquet aptly bringing a lot of surprises to my gf, Special thanks…",5,
"Great place to be close to everything. Just a short walk to the tree park. Singapore is the safest city in the world. We were jet lagged and woke up at 3 am, by 4am we were heading out to the tree park, a couple people running and got to see a colorful view of the purple trees. This hotel has the best infinity pool in the world with the best view of the city of Singapore next to bars and good food. We went to the pool at 6:30am, people were already there, this city never sleeps. There is also a casino and a mall attached to it. If you are going to Singapore, stay at this hotel at least one day and pay the online rate, a bit pricey but worth it. Another place to go is the Altitude bar in downtown for a roof top bar and the speakeasy bar 28.",5,
"we stayed at MBS on last week as a whole family. Starting from the first minute at Reception to the last minute, everything was flawless. We stayed at premiere rooms with city view. The rooms were large enough and the service was great. All the staff were always helpful and assisting. I especially would like to thank Mr. Latiff at the main lobby area. He was always there when we need him and took care of all our questions and needs. Thank you all for this great experience. Can't wait go back that wonderful hotel again.",5,
"Great experience from this hotel. The hotel interior was beautiful and upon arrival, staff were professional, friendly and helpful. We booked a deluxe room but it looked bigger than what the pictures were. Staff were very attentive to our problem we had with the safe and fixed it right away. In the night time a staff member came to our room and brought us an anniversary cake as well as a letter from their team. This was very thoughtful of them to have done this. The views from our room were amazing as well! The infinity pool was also something to remember. Views were stunning from the top. We only stayed here for 1 night and it went by too quick! When I return back to Singapore, I will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,
"We stayed for 1 night (2 days) on our way through Singapore. The room was surprisingly large and the service was good. The pool area is beautiful, but always busy. I found it annoying that if you forgot one of your cards they wouldn't let you in the pool area, but I understand why they have the security they have. My husband swam but the pool was a little too cold for my daughter and I. They gym area is fantastic! Can not fault it. Over all a nice hotel but you are definitely paying for it! No breakfast included either for $850AU! Its a nice hotel but overrated for the price. I have definitely stayed at nicer hotels for the same price. Mind you, im glad we stayed there. It was a good experience, just very expensive.",4,
"When you walk out on to that roof for the first time, you are left absolutely speechless. It doesn't even look real. It's like something out of fantasy. The hotel itself is grand with very nice rooms and a great adjoining mall but what you're paying for is the rooftop pool. It's been a year since I was there and I still can't find the words to describe it; to do it justice. Splash out on the room just to experience it once in your life!",5,
"A great place to stay as well as visit. We enjoyed our time at Marina Bay, we will definitely go again. Recommend it to all first time visitors to Singapore.",4,
"The Hotel Is Huge. It has 3 towers, maybe when you arrive you could know in advance which tower is your room located, because in tower 1 and tower 3 are the front desks. The front desk of the tower 1 was busy, crowed and when I arrived around 7pm the service was slow, they only had 3 staffs working on it, the lady who helped me was nice, also she upgrade my Room because she had noticed my birthday was on the days I was at the hotel. The Room was great, confortable and big enough for me and my husband, on the 28 floor of the 3 tower, with bay view. They have a note about your breakfast, they let you know you could call in room dining service in advance to have your breakfast at your room at the time you wish next day, I did that, and I had it exactly on time. I think they have…",4,
Stayed here for 5 nights in a king room the room was large and spacious like a large luxury apartment. Staff were friendly and polite breakfast was amazing and the view from both the pool and room was amazing.  Marina bay has all the amenities one would require and yes while the view from the infinty pool is amazing the rest of the hotel is equally amazing.,5,
Singapore is one of the most vised tourist destinations in the world a lot of people from India like to spend there holidays there it a modern city with a lot of tourist attraction . But in resent year Marina Bay Sands of Sands group has become an iconic symbol of Singapore. A lot of people like to at least spend one night over there . Marina Bay Sands is a huge hotel with a lot of activities to do like there world famous infinity pool where you feel like you are swimming in the sky .There are gardens by the bay and other stuff to,4,
View and ambiance at the bar on the 57th floor was amazing! definitely a must visit in Singapore! Drinks range from USD 25 upwards. Music was pleasant. Only negative being the we had to wait quite a while to get a standing table to relax and enjoy the drinks but it was worth it.,4,
"We booked this hotel to experience the view from the pool! However, the pool was too crowded. i guess many people thought like us ! All said a wonderful one time experience ! worth staying for one night if paying form your own pocket!",4,
"I recommed to stay there a night or two if you visit Singapore. The hotel is breathtaking both outside and inside not to mention the view from the rooftop infinity pool. The whole Marina Bay Sands area including the Shoppes Mall and the ArtScience Museum and the Singapore Eye are worth a few pictures.  It is amazing how well everything worked at this huge hotel. We had the Deluxe room with city view and it was spacious and luxury, no complaints. The gym at the 55th floor inspires for a daily workout. Watch out those selfie sticks in the infinity pool.",4,
"This is a high quality hotel, based on service and style.  We stayed in one of the executive rooms, which was very large, comfortable bed with nice furnishings.  It had space for a dining table and chairs but the area was left bare, which left a bit of a vacant space in the room.  The room also had a balcony over looking the bay.  As park of our package we had access to the Executive Lounge, which provided a beautiful buffet breakfast and alcoholic drinks and savouries from 5 - 7 pm.  The pool was magnificent and the views over Singapore's financial district amazing.  The only real downside was the busyness of the hotel foyer and main bar area, which had a constant stream of people wandering through to look at the hotel. Not the greatest for a quiet drink but good for people…",4,
"Incredible Hotel whi an Amazing POOL, i stayed there just to swim in that pool - i like that they create a area only for adult and another area mixed, so you can really relax . good Bar, Good Souvenir Shop.- Really nice Room as well, confy bed nice toilet - i liked that i did not had to wait unitl 3pm for the check in but i check ini n at 10:00 i just have to say buy to the hight floor because at that time the room available was at the 4th floor - it was ok :) Good staff at the Reception",5,
"I have to say MBS is one of my favorite places. I have been coming there  for last 4 years at least  twice per  a year , always in Club program. Im so sory but  I have to say the servis geting slowly but  really every  years  litlbit wore and worse...( canceled shutle on and from the airport, problemes to use a Sky park after check out when have  a mighnigt  fly.... atc) It is  quite  apitty  becouse MBS is  one of the most  beautiful places with  wonderfull Sky park, breathtaking  Bay view ..and really very friendly and nice  staff ( especially in club restaurant on sky park). So i hope when I come again and  i really hope I will be soon everythig will be just  perfect as It used to be..",4,
"I stayed at Marina Bay Hotel for 4 days while in Singapore on business. I arrived at 2am so check in was quick & smooth.  My room was on the 32nd floor.  A large room which overlooked the Science & Art Museum.  The next morning the line for breakfast was pretty long, so I found another restaurant in the hotel where there was no line.  Great food!!  As I was expecting, view from the pool (57th floor) was amazing.  A little windy but beautiful.  The Casino was a great diversion when I was looking for something to do. Lots of things to see & do while walking the grounds around the hotel.  I highly recommend checking this place out the next time anyone's in Singapore!!",5,
"Hotel is definitely amazing. From the moment you entered, it's a total luxe!  Good points: - A hotel within a Mall, A mall within a hotel. Endless shopping. Top notch restaurants. - Rooms are superb! We were given a hospitality suite which is very very spacious. It has a bar, a veranda, a living room with a sofa bed (although there's no partition), Bathroom with separate tub, shower and toilet, 2 televisions, and another comfort room for visitors. - Infinity pool! Breathtaking! The view is worth every penny. - Amenities are fantastic! Love the espresso pods, toiletries are complete and the staff is quick to deliver additional amenities requested.  - Early check in is not a problem as long as the room is ready.   For improvement: -Welcoming staff/ Bellman - most of the luxury…",4,
"We had a wonderful time at the hotel, everything was amazing from the rooms to the dinning. I only have one problem.  In the bathroom it states if you do not want your towels washed please hang them up.  Everyday we hung the towels up but everyday the new towels arrived.  There is no need for this.  Also we put our recycled items in the separate bins provided but when emptied they all went into the rubbish.  I think the hotel need to address these problems",5,
"Marina bay sands hotel Observation deck is MUST SEE  thing! I bought the ticket after I have visited Singapure flyer just wanted to check it out. I was surprised the look from 57 floor took my breath away! There is a cafe shop as well, so you can take your time, have the coffee or beer and just enjoy the view of surroundings - no time limit! EXCELLENT!",5,
I my humble opinion this is one of the best hotels in Singapore. The room is huge and luxury. The room was very nice and had everything you needed. It's friendly and fun to be there. The service is just like needs to be. There is spectacular view and I liked the club so much! But changing the elevators is not comfortable.,5,
"I want to go back :) definitely worth it, even just for one night!! The room had a lot of space, very clean and a great view. (I stayed in the 36th floor, with view to the gardens!). No words to the pool (on the 57th floor), amazing environment and view!! I would stay more time if it wasn't so expensive, but it was worth the experience :) had a long queue to check-out but it was really quick, staff member Alice was really nice and professional :) would recommend a stay!!",5,
"Marina Bay was the perfect way to kick off our 6 week holiday on the way to Europe. When we got there we received a free upgrade to a suite which was the size of a house. The pool at the top of the hotel, at the 57th floor was truly breathtaking. We had lunch at the restaurant next to the pool which was really fantastic, with a sensational view of the city.  Will definitely be back! ",5,
The room is very big but not extravagant. It's clean but the water pressure is medium. It has a bathtub shower and sofa to sit. The view from the balcony looking at the marina bay river it is something unforgettable. The service is excellent although the prices are ridiculously high. One bottle of beer 20 ~ 25 Sig. DOLLARS. In general it worths to stay there just for the experience And the view. By the way the bed was very comfortable which was a pleasant experience.,4,
The Marina Bay Sands has the best view over the skyline of Singapore. At any time during the day you have spectacular views and the pool is also great but very cold. Also the club next to the pool is worth to visit. The room was good although it wasn't really special for the price. ,4,
"The hotel is of high standard and the service is excellent but it is possible find it in many other hotels in singapore, the shocking thing is the infinity pool that alone is worth the trip.If we want find a fault the check-out pretty slow but overall stunning.",5,
"If budget isn't a consideration or this is going to be a treat, go for the Club Room as the room is spacious, provides great views and you get privileged access to the Club on the 55th Floor. This meant the flexibility of having complimentary afternoon tea, pre dinner cocktail and snacks plus the option of having breakfast there or Sky on 57 which was fantastic. Service from staff was professional and helpful. Anyone we approached with a question was friendly. We also had easy access to the Skypark and Infinity pool but only for the views as it was way too crowded to be inviting for a swim!",5,
"For our honey moon, my wife's japanese brother, who live in singapore, offered us one night in the famous Marina Bay Sands. He don't speak english and he asked to a japanese receptionist if there will be a problem to make the check in (he couldn't be there because he worked during the day). the receptionist answered there will be no problem and booked a room for us. Last week we arrived at 2PM taking the room but the receptionist said us it was not possible to make the check in cause the presence of the person who booked the room is compulsory. we had to wait for the brother of my wife in the evening and we couldn't use this fantastic swimming pool. It's a shame for a  world famous hotel like yours.",1,
"I suppose it's all you would expect of a Hotel with a high star rating. The rooms was very good so no complaints there. I guess it's worth a night stay but I wouldn't stay there any length of time. It's too pricey for that. The pool was a bit of a disappointment as I was expecting a more of a ""WOW"" factor. It's good but really just another roof top pool. And it gets very busy. We had brunch in the pool bar which was Ok. Again nothing special. we also attempted to have a meal in the ""Sky on 57"" restaurant but actually walked out. The staff were pretty rude, not verbally, just their actions. We actually went downstairs to the Rise restaurant where there was a buffet. I have to admit it was an excellent array of food. We just couldn't eat our moneys worth. The staff were also…",4,
"Beautiful hotel and amazing views! But you do pay for it, although I think the pricing is fair for the hotel quality. The staff are amazing and very helpful. We also are in Rise which again was not cheap but well worth the money. Marina Bay has to be experienced if you have the chance. And don't forget the infinity pool although trying to avoid all the selfie sticks becomes a chore!   ",5,
My husband and I stayed here last week having flown in from Bangalore via the UK  for the Thaipussam festival.  We had seen photos of the hotel and thought great and infinity pool on 57th floor that would be a spectacular treat and perfect place to relax.  However the pool was more like a human fish tank of near fully clothed selfie takers waving selfie sticks.  Oh how I was desperate to knock one overboard (the stick not the human).   We gave up on the pool.  The room facing the MB gardens was very nice however big fail is non double glazed windows and the noise from the road below was quite audible (not good when jet lagged) and they were also doing some renovation works in the main lobby which echoed up to our room early and late.  The breakfast was good but again a sea of…,4,
"Stayed here as part of our Honeymoon.  What impressed us was the seamless running of the hotel and the very attentive staff, especially for such a big place.  A woman working at the front desk was especially helpful (? Jie) by having great knowledge on all the places in town serving chilli crab and good shopping spots. The stay was very relaxing and we will definitely come again. Only downside was the water pressure in the showers was not very good (but we were on the 53rd floor)  Good place to stay when transiting for a few days as taxi fare is relatively cheap from the airport and to orchard st and there's never a shortage of taxis out the front",5,
"We stayed 3 days, and loved the views. The rest was as expected but nothing special. The hotel seems to be sold on the pool, but first time we went it was busy, the second time it was raining and windy so really missed out there.  The internet was down for a full 24 hours on the first day. Couldn't do any work or facebook. Staff were very unhelpful giving up fix times of two hours distance each time which meant after waiting two hours and it's still not up one gets more frustrated. In the end it was next day afternoon when I got back and it was working.  Although not that old it's showing signs of stress. The rails in the lifts were all loose, and on some had been removed completely just leaving bolts sticking out of the walls. There was no gym in my tower and it' was a bit of a…",4,
Place very well architected and an impressive views. Great atmosphere for a drinkes the edge of a pool with endless edges.,5,
"Well, we were surprised how good this place was after some pretty mediocre reviews on T/A.  We arrived about 8pm from the airport (so off-peak) and were checked in without any queuing.  The guy checking us in was quite chatty and upbeat.  We had booked a “premier with city view” which got us up to around level 22+(?) and I assume enough to see the river.  We were surprised to be offered an upgrade to a club room on level 44 and on learning of the time of our flight out the next day, we were offered a late checkout without charge that was perfect.   We were a bit unclear on our plans for the evening and normally eat earlier.  When we thumbed through the huge directory in the room, we thought room service sounded quite nice and good value.  We both ordered Nasi goreng, which came…",5,
"The hotel itself looks amazing, it's really an icon of Singapore. The rooms are spacious and furnished in a nice modern way. It is really crowdy fells like on a train station at the reception. Changing the elevators is uncomfortable. Queuing for breakfast shouldn't happen in a hotel of such standard",3,
"On a business trip to Singapore I chose this hotel, and it was awesome. You simply cannot imagine the high quality of the rooms, staff, and restaurants in this hotel until you've been here yourself. Of course the main attraction is the roof pool with a breathtaking view over Singapore's bay and the many high business buildings surrounding it. Also impressive is the water and laser show in front of the hotel, where you see movies projected on fountains, lasers from the hotel which are in perfect harmony with the music. An experience you must attend when you are staying here. Only downside are the prices for food in the chinese restaurant in the hotel: it is expensive. If you fancy Malaysian food, you should definitely try the satay in the piano bar.",5,
"This  observation deck had wonderful views of Singapore.  We were expecting to have a drink at the top, but it  was only for hotel guest , a bit disappointing.",4,
"This was our third visit to the Marina Bay Sands in just over 2 years and the whole experience was as good as the first stay.  If you like a quiet sedate hotel then the Marina Bay is not for you but if you prefer the  hustle & bustle of a 24x7 5 star hotel with attentive staff, the best infinity pool you have ever seen, good food and well appointed rooms then this the hotel for you.  Did I mention attentive staff. Several reviews are less than complimentary about the staff. In all our visits I have never had a problem or need to critise anyone. From the guys on the desk, in the main restaurant & bar or pool area, room service or cleaners they are all there to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Maybe if you treat others how you want to be treated yourself then you'll have a…",5,
I thought it was overrated.Over priced for what you get.Expensive stores not for the average person.Probably suited for younger people to go up to the top for a swim and the view.,2,
"I stayed here for two nights. Luckily the check in was really fast since we arrived at 18:00 from the airport. The room had stunning views over the bay and the CBD, it was clean and spacious (tower 3).  I went to the club on Friday night, the music was not the best and the ambience a bit strange. Still it was good to enjoy the views with a drink.  The pool was breathtaking and a must. I went to the central one, away from the curious eyes of the visitors who go to where the club is during the day to enjoy the views.  I think it's a hotel to stay once and then to move to a smaller and quieter one around the CBD or colonial district.",4,
"The signature infinity pool is a bold idea which attracts a lot of visitors, to a point where it spoils the experience.  We booked a club room to have the city view and access to the Club Lounge. There is however no 'Club' area on the 57th floor where you can enjoy the infinity pool in a somewhat relaxed atmosphere, there's just a no kids area in the eastern third. And that spoils it. Unless you go at 7am, expect huge crowds. Enormous crowds. Nothing that ressembles the atmosphere of a luxury hotel in line with the steep price you paid for your room. People arguing to get in, kids running and screaming everywhere, every lounge chair occupied. It borders on obnoxious and has nothing of the exlusive and luxurious feel you would expect at such price points. So much for the infinity…",3,
"We stayed here just one night but had a great time. We were allowed to check into our room early and were even offered a layer check out of 12 which was great and the reception had fantastic customer service. The room was lovely and had everything you needed. The view from the room was also stunning. We enjoyed the pool which although cold, the views made up for. The pool was busy but what do you expect, the hotel has over 2000 rooms and I'm sure all the guests will want to enjoy this iconic pool so it will be busy. We were just glad that there was an adult only section so we could enjoy the view without getting splashed! We had some Singapore slings by the poolside which were great. In the evening we went to the casino which was really busy but good fun. We didn't fancy any of…",5,
I stayed here for 2 nights in November'14.  Hotel is real superb beauty. Its a jewel of Singapore. Rooftop Swimming pool is amazing. Also look of city from there is marvelous.  Rooms are real big and attached toilet is sooo big and spacious.  I love this and wanna go there again,5,
"As a frequent traveller, I don't have high expectation for such a big hotel, especially when it's also a landmark. But my experience was great! The front desk staff heard that i will only stay over night and will have early morning meeting the next day, and then he was very kind to give me an upgraded room, which is a cornor room with better views. I am very pleased with the room.   The swimming pool is a bit crowded and cold for a serious swimmer (for example, me), but the view is unbelievable.   I will definitely stay longer next time, maybe visit the Casino!",5,
"This hotel is seriously overpriced for what they offer compared to other landmarks around the world. But it is a landmark nonetheless so if you have money to blow and/or want to really impress, go for it.  The other trouble with Marina Bay Sands is that... you cannot see Marina Bay Sands from your hotel window :-) And it is such an iconic view! So personally I would rather stay on the opposite side of the bay, Fullerton or Mandarin perhaps?   Remember you can use the rooftop pool, bars etc even if you're not a hotel guest..   Also remember that only half of the rooms overlook the bay. And that it is a massive institution where you will not get much attention.  Yes, it's an experience, but you can 'experience' it all the same by sleeping in a much nicer and cheaper room elsewhere…",3,
"One place where you must go!! If doesnt matter if you win or loose, but the energy levels of this place are so amazing! Lady luck would always shine on you. Drinks on the house!",5,
"My husband & I stayed in the Orchard Suite with our adult son. The suite was spacious and luxury with views. There was a bath with flower pedals floating. The expresso machine was handy.   Bathroom amenities were top notch. Checking in was quick as there were only 2 people before us. It was 11pm though. Thanks for Shawn & Keith who checked us in & out and their professionalism made my trip more pleasant.  At around 7am we hit the infinity pool. Disappointedly we only managed to take some photos as it was freezing cold and windy up there. At the Shoppes, some eating stalls in the food court open 24 hours which is just wonderful. Food is good there. Visited 2 observatories which were all worth it. Bring a jacket as it's cold inside.  It's a shame we only had one night transit…",4,
we stayed here overnight with my family. the room we got has an amazing view of the gardens by the bay. the room is so clean as well as the bathroom. the service was amazing and they got fast & free internet connection. this hotel rocks!!,4,
"Awesome pool, spectacular to look at but ridiculous service.  We booked a Club room and were made to feel like we didn't deserve to be there by the staff.  They told us everytime we went to the lifts that they weren't for us, we were in the wrong place, this was for special guests and not us..  I'm sorry that I don't look like I have money as that's all the staff seemed to want.",2,
"We had a wonderful night stop over at Marina Bay Sands, and what can I say but WOW! Front first point of service at the check in, to the Room service, it was wonderful. The infinity pool was amazing and well worth the view, photo opportunities and the swim!! Totally recommend the visit and highly recommend the stay! Keep up the good work!",5,
"Over the top luxuary mall, attached to a massive casino, with a great food court of various Asian foods... pretty good value, variety and flavors.    Giant casino is a sight to behold, even if you're not a gamber.  Big lux brands, gondola rides, giant windows overlooking the bay, and perhaps the most important feature of all--  great A/C.  All in all, it's a nice cool place to get your power walks in a very hazy hot and humid city.  Rooftop is fancy, fantastical and kind of a must see in Singapore.",4,
"Loved the room and location of hotel, but the pool area (coolest feature) was very crowded. Lobby and check-in had long queue. Difficult to get loungers and average poolside menu.  Best feature was room - spacious with large bathroom and gorgeous view from large balcony (but no balcony furniture). Gym is huge with plenty of equipment. The gym view (F55) is lovely and every treadmill faces the window.  Would I stay there again? Probably not. A great one-time visit (2 nights only) but would stay elsewhere next time.",5,
What a fantastic experience makes you feel special as soon as you walk through the door spent 3 nights as a stopover. Had a premier room with great views and the infinity pool was wonderful. Had the buffet breakfast and evening meal everything was there what you wished for in food delicious can't wait to go back .....,5,
A beautiful place in the middle of the top must sees in Singapore. With a infinity pool and a amazing watchers gallery this place just a synonym to elegance.  With the best ammonites  shopping mall MRT Station just a walk away this place would just make it to one of the best designed hotels in the world.  Out the wide spread breakfast buffet the only disappointment as a foodie was the waffles server for breakfast.,4,
Superb hotel.  Great value for money.  Fantastic panorama and location in Marina Bay. The sky park with th einfinity pool is breathtaking.  Great facilities and services.  Certainly the best in Singapore.,5,
"Got to finally stay here as a birthday surprise! I really loved the room, it was facing the city and it was just absolutely gorgeous. We didn't really have to leave the hotel area - went to watch Mamma Mia, shopping, lots of dining choices around, also got to spend time at the beautiful infinity pool and even a spa session at Banyan Tree. Hopefully will be able to do another staycation here sometime soon! It was a tad overcrowded, but just need to find the right timing to spend at certain places in the hotel without all the tourists. Oh and Ku De Ta was a little underwhelming, expected more but it was kinda depressing.........",4,
"Landmark in Singapore with fantastic view from all hotel room...great place to stay. I stayed for 2 nights on busiiness. Food quality is good, attactions are great and easy access to all attraction including Singapore Metro (MRT). Signature pool was great thought extremly cold water in pool at 57th floor wind does not help!....  All in all enjoyed the stay.......",5,
"Was there for a staycation for my son birthday as the like the infinity pool which MBS have. Checked in was fast without any hassle, room was great, view is spectacular. We had 2 adult 2 kid staying and the housekeeping was thoughtful to prepared 4 towel and toothbrush for us. So everything was fine till the next day where we get to enjoy the pool it was fun till we had miss the timing which the hotel room card actually expired. After our swim we can't access to the lift which bring us to our room so we had to cover ourself with the towel to the lobby for validation of our card. Guess what they did not validate properly & we are stuck inside the lift could't reach our floor to get into our room. Once again we had to go down to the lobby counter & queue again for the whole…",3,
"We recently spent 2 terrific nights at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. We had a premier room  with the most spectacular views over the Marina Bay Park  and enjoyed morning swims in the infinity pool on the 57th level of the hotel. Quite incredible. Breakfast was buffet style, tasty and generous.The hotel is well located, and has a wide range of restaurants, shopping and entertainment opportunities within the complex - high end fashion - expensive but nice to browse!) casino (not really my scene but packed with punters!) theatre (good selection of shows ) and The Art Science Museum where we went to view the ""Da Vinci: Shaping the Future"" Exhibition. Fantastic exhibition - not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore. A quick cab ride gets you into the centre of town…",5,
"We stayed 4 nights in a club room with a 3 year old as a stop over. The service and hospitality were outstanding.  From the towel animals left for our son to staff in the Club knowing his name upon entry and asking questions about his day, you could not expect more. ",5,
"The MBS is just as you expect it. Huge, pretty luxurious, expensive, crowded and generally superb.   I travelled there for business in December and spent 6 days. I enjoyed the room, located on the 43rd floor with stunning city views. But the sea views are just as amazing as some colleagues enjoyed that so it really depends whether you are a skyline or nature kind of person.  The room was well appointed and they upgraded me to a superior as we were hosting an event in their convention centre. Pretty business oriented type of room though - nothing extra ordinary. I must say I would have liked a Nespresso machine in the room and you'd expect it considering the prices. But anyway...  The facilities of the hotel are of very high standard and the infinity pool is clearly an highlight.…",5,
