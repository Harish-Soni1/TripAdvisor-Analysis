This hotel has good location and easy to access through public transportation MRT. No need to worry about the strong sunshine or raining.  The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Thank you for putting my three rooms nearby for me to take care of the elderly easier. Well done!  Best Regards  Catherine,5,Date
"We stayed in room 3777 which is a City view room and the views did not disappoint.  At check in and check out the staff was very courteous although I cannot say the same for the bell desk and porters who are very indifferent.  The pool is probably the best feature of the hotel where time flies and you do not feel the need to leave.  The hotel is a little crowded and you will find crowds of group tours or seminars at all times. The breakfast is very good with a huge spread. If staying at MBS I would recommend not to leave the hotel and see the museum, malls etc located in the vicinity. Overall a great experience.",5,1/1/2021
"I'd say that a stay here is more about an 'experience' rather than a 'hotel'.  So consider it a bit like an adult Disneyland as opposed to a luxury hotel.  Overall we had a great stay and there is nothing I could fault.  We had a club room on the 37th floor facing the city for 2 nights.  Room was of good size, bathroom especially spacious and well appointed.  The 'hiding' of the nespresso machine away in the wardrobe and the sugar / tea in a drawer with  a lack of convenient plugs was the only minor grumble about the room.  I would complement the hotel for the quietness of the room - I normally am a light sleeper and get woken by any noise, but the room was very quiet.   So what about the title of this review.  Well really, I suspect many stay here for the same reason we did -…",4,1/2/2021
"I had always wanted to stay here after coming across it studying. Upon arrival I queued at the normal reception, I was approached by a member of staff named Mokoko, taken to the VIP reception and they gave me one extra hour to check out the next day which was a nice bonus. The room was clean and the view was wonderful.  The swimming pool is everything I expected. It's an incredible experience spending the day there. It wasn't busy and I easily found space for myself.  The service I received and the experience made it worth the money.",5,1/3/2021
"It was an amazing experience for us , very nice location in front of the bay and the financial center from one side and in front of the sea and the gardens of the bay from the other side .  Rooms are big , really big I booked the sea view room .  Room is not so fancy but clean with full amenities  Sky park in the last floor is just amazing   The only problems  It's huge hotel with too many guests some times it get very crowded in the lobby and in the reception and most of the times the staff are dealing with this in very fast and nice way   Highly recommended hotel !",5,1/4/2021
"Stayed for one night, one of the Best hotel in Singapore, check in is very smooth . Rooms are very Nice and spacious with fantastic view of Garden by Bay,Pool and sky Bar is amassing .Must Stay Hotel for at least 2 nights",5,1/5/2021
"A nice modern property - but as many have said probably not worth the money you pay for - though somewhere you stay for one night - just so that you can experience the infinity pool on the 57th floor with its amazing Singapore skyline view  (which is only open to hotel guests).  Yes - the pool is busy with lots of children running around, but if you time your visit for early morning or later on in the evening, alot of the crowds have disappeared by then.  There have been lots of complaints about long check in check out times - and i'd agree the number of desks in wholly inadequate for the number of guests the hotel caters for - especially at peak times. However, our experience was that this took no time at all.  Our room itself was big, clean and modern - and we got a…",4,1/6/2021
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands during a 2 days stopover in Singapore on my way to Australia. It was a very comfortable stay in a stunning suite. Everything was perfect, from the moment I arrived, the porter took care of my luggage, check-in was fast and efficient. The room was beautiful and so very well appointed. The entire experience was a real delight, mostly thanks to the professional and helpful staff. Thank you!",5,1/7/2021
"We stay 4 nights in this luxury Hotel. The pool is amazing. Room have a good size. Roomservice, Housekeeping and Concierge was perfect. Many thanks goes to Stewart. He knows insidertips.  The lobby looks a Airport Terminal.  One time in your life you must stay in this Hotel when you have the pleasure to be in Singapur.",5,1/8/2021
"Stayed in this hotel during the period November 13 - 15, 2013. This hotel is an excellent property, but is too pricey and not very well managed. The breakfast wasn't included in the price of SGD 693.25.",3,1/9/2021
"Amazing design ! I wouldnt recommend to sleep there (I think it's too huge) but it is worse to go up to take a cocktail, have a look over the harbour and admire this amazing pool",4,1/10/2021
"Marina Bay Sands Hotel has become an icon in Singapore with its Skypark and infinity edge swimmingpool at 57th floor.  The room was nice and spacious with a fantastic view over the skyline, but that did not do justice for the price we paid. 600++sgd for a night without breakfast and then you don't even get a turndown for the evening and that is so sad. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, but it feels like a 3 star. The check-in is not even in a separate lobby, but in a walkway for everyone who wants to visit with long queues. But if swimming with a crowd of mainland chinese and russians shouting and waving with their selfie tripods in a cold pool full of tissues, chocolatepapers and whatever else is ok for you then go for it. If you want to feel pampered then stay at The…",2,1/11/2021
"Stayed here for four nights with me , my husband and my two teenage kids  , on our arrival the rooms where not ready.we waited  till 4oclock and rooms where still not ready they wanted us to stay on 22nd floor and my kids on 8th which I wasn't happy about at the end they gave us sane floor view and location is nice the view from pool is beautiful but the pool is very cold till 4 pm that wasn't nice overall the hotel is ok been in nice hotels then this won't stay there again will only stay in orchard road",4,1/12/2021
Stayed here for one night and that was enough. The checkin took over an hour due to a stuff up on the hotel end. We had just landed and were tired and boiling hot but they did not offer any refreshments or any upgrade at all. Just a sorry have a nice stay. I felt for the price it would have been much better. I think it's a hotel that people stay in just to have stayed there. The room was very nice but I wouldn't choose to pay the prices they charge again. ,3,1/13/2021
"We visited the area to see the marina bay sands hotel, which you can pay to go up to the observation deck only, not the infinity pool (which is hotel guests only) the hotel itself is very impressive, there's also the casino and loads of shops, cafes and restaurants. The view to the other side of the harbour are great too",4,1/14/2021
"We loved our stay at the Marina Bay Sands. The absolute highlight is of the hotel is obviously the sky deck with its infinity pool, that is absolutely stunning, and two great bars!  The breakfast buffet is very diverse as well and the rooms are what you would expect of a place like this! Checking in and out went quick and the service was good!",5,1/15/2021
"We have just spent 2 nights at Marina Bay Sands hotel, we stayed there purely for the pool and it didn't dissapoint. The hotel is very clean, rooms are very nice, we overlooked the harbour and had a small balcony, which was nice, we overlooked Gardens By The Bay.  The pool was just wonderful, it is one of a kind, it wasn't so busy during the the day, but got a busier at night. The Hotel Restuarants were quite expensive, but that is also for everything else in Singapore. The Shops at the hotel were also expensive, all designer named shops, so didn't do much shopping. Overall this hotel did not dissapoint would defiantly go back, was well worth the Money. Staff efficient and friendly.",5,1/16/2021
"Ok, this hotel is beautiful. From the outside to the lobby, everything is very luxurious and sparkly.  As expected, the check in line was very busy although did notice staff going around asking questions to shorten the time for their check-in. Within a few minutes of waiting in line, somebody asked them to come to the VIP lounge where someone can assist with our check-in. The lounge was very classy and sophisticated, and the girl that assisted us was so lovely and friendly. She even gave us a free upgrade to a Club Suite with city views because it was my birthday this week, and gave us a late check-out which is really nice of her. We then went to our room. Now, the view from the room was jaw-dropping. But the décor of the room itself was just a little too bland for my taste…",4,1/17/2021
"It is one of the best hotels one can stay in Singapore.The architecture there is absolutely amazing and makes you go ""Wow"".The rooms are really exclusive and comfortable but little on the higher side.The connectivity to the Casino,Shopping mall and the stunning Garden by the bay makes it even more interesting.The view from the room is so nice that staying inside the room itself gets you connected to the city around.Overall it's an amazing place to stay with family and friends.",5,1/18/2021
"The hotel is really great: nice design, very innovative, impressive views, very comfortable rooms, very polite and helpful staff. But it is not organised in proper way: all the time queue for check in/check out, huge queue for breakfast which itself is very average and even poor. I understand that hotel is very big and it is difficult to manage but they have employ the best managers then. Atmosphere in a hotel is like at train station always crowdy and noisy so it is very uncomfortable for having the rest. Swimming pool is beautiful area but dirty: You can find a lot of rubbish inside like: plastic cups, strows, etc. Generally definitely worth to visit despite the fact that all bad opinions are fully deserved.",3,1/19/2021
"This building never ceases to amaze me, not only is it a work of art, in the oddest way possible due to the size of the thing but it is monumental for the Singapore skyline. The infinity pool and the skybar is worth checking out. The rooms are ok, not spectacular but just ok. I'd highly recommend the spa, when your done with your treatment, you lounge on the observation deck drinking tea and eating fresh fruit they bring to you.  ",4,1/20/2021
"The Premium Sevice team led by Jasmine were incredible - birthday cake upon arrival , pick up at the airport, incredible room,  reservations to the top restuarants and an ability to move quickly with a change in plans - as good as good can get and bettter than I have experienced around the world",5,1/21/2021
"The view on Singapore's Skyline is amazing. I would certainly recommend to book a room with city view!  The pool itself is smaller than expected. However, during our stay, we never had the feeling that the infinity pool was too crowded. The water temperature is quite low which, however, was no issue for us.  The Hotel Lobby is not very welcoming. There are many tourists Walking through the facilities and there is a rather cold atmosphere.  Nevertheless, all in all I would recommend everybody who comes to Singapore to stay in this nice Hotel.",5,1/22/2021
"Nice place in front of the water. Everything was connected to the hotel - shopping mall, casino, theatre, Gardens by the Bay etc. - so you literally didn't have to go far. The room was nice and big, and we got a nice view. Room service was pleasant. Most of the staff were nice. The Infinity Pool was always busy and everyone was taking too many photos, but the view was awesome.  A real big turn-off was the toilet that overflowed..... It reached the carpet in our room. Called the staff to come for help, but I had to call them another time and still wait another 10 minutes (a very long time, especially if the toilet is overflowing constantly) for a serviceman to come and fix it. He was a bit rude - had an attitude that seemed like 'suck it up, you ain't getting a new room'. We were…",3,1/23/2021
"Had a staycation here few months back as a hotelier myself, I must say that I was impressed with their level of service and the quality of their facilities. Their infinity pool is a must go! View is superb.",5,1/24/2021
"Spent a weekend here with 2 other friends, it's soo convenient because all the great shops are just in the same area. If you are craving for a good food, you can visit Din Tai Fung's and a lot more... Make up lovers, bag lovers and shoe lovers, this is the place to be! and at night, you can chillout at Ku De Ta! Fun! Fun! ",4,1/25/2021
"This hotel is really amazing! Everywhere you look is a trick piece of great arquitecture. Outside you see like a huge boat raised by three skyscrapers, inside you have the shape like pyramid or something like it and at the top you have the coolest pool that i've ever seen with great view of the city. My home now looks ugly and pointless kkkk. Worth every penny!",5,1/26/2021
"The infinity pool on the top floor was busy everyday and most people had their selfie sticks to hand to capture the downtown skyline of bustling Singapire city.  There were always plenty of available sun beds on which to people watch. I would also highly recommend the Japanese restaurant for dinner, if you have a city view table you can easily watch the nightly laser shows ",5,1/27/2021
"We stayed here for a night with my family as we had our short trip in Singapore because we want to experience this iconic building and as expected from reviews, experience was great! Service and facilities were excellent, room was large enough for the 4 of us. The pool was just breathtaking. And everything else was perfect. This is definitely worth the price we paid for. ",5,1/28/2021
"I decided to splurge a little and get an orchid suite. I wanted a guaranteed high floor with a city view. The room was very large, I did only get the 20th floor, would have liked a little higher, but they did give me a complimentary early check in (10AM) which I was very grateful for, so I probably got the 20th floor cause the others were full. The best part of this hotel is the infinity pool and the skypark. I did really enjoy using The Club, which was a perk of having booked a suite. The breakfast was very nice, lots of choices. The only negative I had was the pool area was very slippery. I did actually fall down and hurt my back. There was signage but not big enough. This should be improved upon, bigger signage of slippery floors.",5,1/29/2021
After having been in Ho Chi Minh City for a week of work I decided to take a quick weekend get away to Singapore for some fun in the sun.  Although there are cheaper luxury hotels to stay at in Singapore I wanted to enjoy some sun and the pool at the Marina Bay Sands.  The pool was amazing and exceed my already high expectations.  I was a bit concerned as I was staying over a weekend and thought it might be a challenge to get a sun lounger on the pool deck however never ever had a problem finding a seat. I've been fortunate to stay at many luxury hotels and this by far has the best pool I've ever been too.  My room which had the ocean view was great and felt like a luxury 5 star hotel room.  My only small disappointment was long lines as check in however there was a staff member…,5,1/30/2021
"There is no doubt this hotel has the wow factor, the views alone make it stand out and the large bedroom windows make the most of the views. Go for a high floor to make the most of them. I used the fitness suite several times and the view from the trend mill takes your mind of the pain.,it is a well equipped gym and the staff are always on hand to clean the machines or offer advice. The rooms are sizeable enough, clean with nice touches like the curtains and blinds open automatically when you put your key card in, the bathroom had a good sized powerfull shower. The hotel is close to Gardens on the Bay which include 2 sub tropical dome full of flowers and waterfalls - well worth a visit and keep your airline ticket as you get discount from most airlines to enter. The view from…",4,1/31/2021
"Pros: - The famous infinity pool. - The gym which is right below the pool with great views. - Rooms are clean.  Cons: - We were very un-impressed by the room. Given the price we expected more. Very basic room with boring furniture had an airport hotel feel. - Staff were very uptight. We felt this especially flying in from Bali where we were pampered and greeted with smiles everywhere we went. The hotel is huge with a lot of traffic whether it's from hotel guests or tourists who want to check out the famous pool. The pool is strictly for the use of hotel guests. Visitors may only visit Ku De Ta (a lounge/bar next to the pool). In order to control this each guest must carry a room card key to access pool or gym. Me and my husband can't go in with one key, which is fine but wasn't…",4,2/1/2021
"I have stayed in mbs for 2 times. Their enviroment are great and rooms are clearly and nicely done up. They serve great buffet dinner and have many different restaurants at their location. Tourists whom love shopping and taking photographs will be an advantage as mbs has lots of designer boutiques and beautiful secenery swimming pool for photography. Their staffs are all polite and helpful in attending to the needs of every individual guest. Overall, i would say mbs is value for money hotel to stay. ",4,2/2/2021
Marina Bay Sands shines with excellent customer service and fantastic food.Skypark was the Winner for me as the pool @ 57 was a very relaxing and a true nourishment for my soul and body.Food served at skypark was really good and we loved the drinking water which had a hint of citrus in it.All in All it was a bit pricey as we paid around $500 for 1 night with city view but definitely going back for more☺️,5,2/3/2021
"This hotel thinks it is the finest hotel in Singapore and I would suggest that was probably the case when it first opened and trying to establish its reputation. This is my third business stay at the Sands in as many months and each time the service has been worse than the time before.   It's a shame because the hotel is well positioned has great facilities and the staff usually mean well but the way the hotel is managed means rule changes that affect guests aren't being made clear and they cause embarrassment - for the guest!  I think it's also clear that the hotel staff spend more time and effort on certain types of guest or people from particular countries, so if you're from the UK you'll get the dusty room with the leaky floor and wet carpet, your bags will be lost by the…",2,2/4/2021
Great place to visit as a icon destination but for me to crowded and better value for money options available elsewhere . Nevertheless a wonderful experience but won't be back . The gardens are superb at the rear of the hotel and great place to walk in the morning ,4,2/5/2021
"Loved MBS, would not hesitate to recommend and will definitely go back. Once you leave the very busy lobby, every aspect is great, huge bedrooms and bathrooms  We had a standard King room which was more than sufficient.  SkyPark on 57 is breath taking with the Marina on one side and the ocean view on the other. The staff were excellent and concierge could not have been more helpful, giving advice and organising visit's to the attractions, before and after we checked out. The only negatives, cleanliness was slightly lacking in places and some of the decor is a little shabby.",4,2/6/2021
"We were a little hesitant to stay here after reading some of the reviews (i.e. the pool is too crowded, check in takes long, etc.).   However, we had an amazing experience.  We checked in within 10 minutes and it was effortless.  Check out was just as easy.  We went to the pool around 10am and had front row seats at the pool.  Service was great and it wasn't crowded at all.  Everything you need is in the hotel (casino, shops, awesome restaurants).  We were there during the week, so maybe the weekend is a different story, but we LOVED it.  The room was very comfortable and had all the amenities that you could want.",4,2/7/2021
"Stayed there 2 nights and what can I say....It was amazing! The view we had from the bedroom is just WOW! The Pool is another WOW...and the view as well. The staffs are very helpful, just pick up the phone from the room and ask them anything, they will try their best to assist you. We went clubbing at Kudeta on a friday night and we had a great time!  I wouldn't mind going again!",5,2/8/2021
"We stayed late November 2014 for 3 Nights on our way back from a week in Thailand. An Opulent Stop-over!! Great service and MANY AMMENITIES but at a PRICE!! A must do is The Rooftop Pool. The Banyan Tree Spa in Marina Bay Sands was NOT GOOD!! A bad massage and they burn Citronella - which I had to point out to Management etc that is Very Toxic and SHOULD ONLY BE USED OUTDOORS!! They told me they would investigate but said it was their SIGNATURE SCENT!!! Management from Marina Bay Sands were supposed to follow up my COMPLAINT and I gave them my email address as my husband and I were only staying for 3 Days and they still have not followed it up with me!! They over-promise but under-deliver which made my short stay not as enjoyable, due to having wasted my time chasing-up…",5,2/9/2021
"We stayed at this hotel and were in a club room. This meant higher floors and a view of the financial district of Singapore - the same view you would see from the pool - and the room was amazing, huge with comfortable beds and a bathroom fitted very luxuriously and all the amenities you would expect of a five star hotel.   The pool itself was a bit of a disappointment - crowded, small and very cold (up at the top of this hotel, it is windy making the hot and humid air much cooler). Not ideal for swimming as it's merely a lap pool - it would be hard to swim anyway, given the number of people taking selfies.. As club floor guests, we had evening cocktails and canapes along with champagne - this was great, good quality food and the champagne was a huge plus point. Service was…",4,2/10/2021
"I first saw this hotel 4 years ago whilst travelling in Singapore during a boat cruise.  I knew that next time I would have to stay there.  We went to Singapore for the sole purpose of staying at this hotel and it did not disappoint.  I booked 2 rooms in early Jan and it was fantastic!  We stayed in tower 3 on level 36.  The rooms are huge with lots of storage, drawers, cupboards and lighting.  The rooms have little balconies.  I won't go on too much about the rooms as there is so much more to say.  Firstly, the pool.  It is on level 57 skydeck and it is better than any pictures you see.  It is a bigger area than what I thought it would be.  The pool is really long and fairly wide and even though everyone is in there posing for pictures with their selfie sticks, there is plenty…",5,2/11/2021
A first sight of the building takes your breath away; three 56 storey towers with a ship perched across the top on them. Then the lobby of tower 1 with its impressive underuse of space and finally the rooms; quite a decent size with a large bathroom complete with separate shower and large bath. The bathroom layout does mean that despite the size it is only practical for one person to be using any of the facilities art any time. A bit more thought could have made this area much more useably efficient. Breakfast on deck 57 is an impressive spread of mostly recognisable dishes and options although there are a few Asian specialities that are worth a try but may not suit western tastes. Hot options delivered to the table are also available.  The adjoining bar gives magnificent views…,5,2/12/2021
"Stayed here the last couple night of our Singapore trip. The Hotel is very nice and spacious.  We got a large corner suite facing gardens by the bay. Everything was perfectly clean and comfortable. Service was good as well for such a large resort. Of course the infinity pool was an amazing experience, something we have never experienced before. Aside from the infinity pool, there are hot tubs overlooking the city as well. This place is something else. If visiting Singapore its a Must Stay, at least for a night or two.",5,2/13/2021
That was my 1st foreign trip in my life happened to visit Singapore. I went to Marina bay Sands by my friend refer only. It was really a very pleasant to me and the atmosphere and service really superb and attractive. I never forget it in my life. I felt was in heaven on that time. It is simply worthy and good. I will surely refer my colleagues and friends who visit Singapore to stay at Marina Bay Sands atleast a day to realize the feel what i felt. I thank Staffs  & every one there since they made my moment unforgettable.  Planned to visit Singapore in Dec 2015 and will definitely stay at Marina Bay Sands only.,5,2/14/2021
"Fabulous hotel! Excellent, friendly efficient staff and the room has magical views, either at the bay or the Marina Bay Sand Garden & sea view; both equally magical!  The swimming pool is the worlds highest up outdoor pool- you can't swim closer to the stars than here. No words to describe the feeling swimming late in the evening under the stars, order a drink to sip and see the lights of the skyscrapers…below you!!!  Once in a lifetime experience. ",5,2/15/2021
"One can say what they want about this property, but it is completely worth every penny. It isn't just the staying that makes you want to go back, its the part where you will not want to see the rest of the city. Its a completely self contained property. The swimming pool is the main attraction, along with the lovely restaurants there. the auditorium where they hold shows, broadway musicals is another added bonus. The view is breathtaking from the room. The casino too is where your night will just fly by. On the whole, an experience not worth missing, at least once.",4,2/16/2021
"I am usually a boutique hotel frequenter but the family wanted to go to Marina Bay Sands and splash out in the sky high pool. I am glad we went because the pool was an extraordinary sight (seconded only by the number of people taking selfies in the pool). We had a quick check in, the room over looking Gardens by the Bay was spacious enough to have an extra bed and still be able to move. Being able to open the window was a relief. We did not eat at the hotel and used it as a base for our two night stay. Expensive but worth it for just the once.",4,2/17/2021
"We decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands for our last night in Singapore and it was worth it.  The rooms are spacious with beautiful views - we overlooked the Gardens by the Bay and they were gorgeous.  The pool is all that we thought it would be with stunning views.  The only complaint I have is service on the 57th floor.  We went up for a night swim and I thought it would be nice to sit on the lounge chair with a glass of wine and enjoy the evening.  It was difficult to find anyone to take my order, and then once the order was placed, it took a long time for my wine to arrive.  Given how expensive the drinks are, I would have expected better service.  In order to maximize our pool time, we decided to eat breakfast at the cafe by the pool in the morning.  The service was horribly…",4,2/18/2021

My room was upgraded due to it being my Birthday which was a great surprise. Our room had a fantastic view of Singapore and the room was huge! Very modern and very comfortable. We hit the pool and had a great time up there, even had some professional shots done in the pool. It is great having the shopping centre and MRT only a short walk away. The line for breakfast in the Lobby was HUGE! So we opted for a beautiful fresh breakfast on the pool deck. Great stay and enjoyed every minute. A must do once in your life.",4,2/19/2021
"This hotel is all that I have read about it. Of course the swimming pool at the top is this hotels greatest advantage. But this is a must try! The only way to do that is to stay at the hotel. We had a Club room, and it is defintely Worth the extra Money. Great brekfast, and great Food and drinks in the evening. And the bar next to the Club: Thanks to all the staff for an excellent service. The rooms were great and spacious, With a lovely bathroom. We will com back!",5,2/20/2021

"From the moment we stepped out of the taxi, this place has been amazing! Their levels of service and attention to detail have all exceeded expectations. We had a fantastic room in Tower 2, and I suggest definitely paying the extra to upgrade to the city view room - the view never gets old! Even if you stay one night here it's worth it! We stayed the one night just to experience it and say we've done it!   AND the view from the pool is breathtaking!",5,2/22/2021

"We had a good sized bay view room on the 30th floor. No complains about the room. If you're not trying your luck at the casino, the place to be is the swimming pool at the Skypark, which is where we headed to.  The view was excellent! It's just like floating in the clouds while taking a dip in the pool or sipping a drink on a deck chair. The swimming pool though was colder than expected",4,2/25/2021
"I recently stayed a MBS to attend a conference and brought my family as well. We all had a ball at the 57th floor pool and observation deck, neighbouring shop and restaurants, as well as could easily meet up during my conference breaks. The top floor bar Ku de Ta is an excellent spot to unwind and see the night Singapore lights. Great music too. The hotel is very large with 3 towers, but we never felt like one of the masses. Highly recommend paying the extra $$$ to stay. Great base visit and see from height everything Singapore has to offer. ",5,2/26/2021
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for two nights while in transit to Australia. The rooms were luxurious, thoroughly cleaned, and all of the layout and components of the room were comfortable. The reception is very courteous and the concierge is very courteous and helpful. The restaurants produced very tasty food and excellent service. The Sky Park pool on the 57th floor is amazing, one of the most unique pools in the world i'm sure. I went to the Ku De Tah rooftop bar on a Wednesday night which is lady's night and it was a little bit too busy for myself, just going for casual drinks but it provided spectacular views. The shopping mall attached the hotel consists of mostly high end stores and the casino is quite large and was quite fun. This hotel provides enough amenities…",5,2/27/2021
"Marina Bay Sands is more than merely accommodation in a foreign city. It is a tourist attraction in its own right. Which brings with it positives and negatives. Positives abound, with the stunning Infinity Pool the gem in their crown.  Reception was professional and friendly, the room well appointed with gorgeous views over Marina Bay toward the Merlion, and the location near the colourful Gardens by the Bay yet another boon. We did not eat at the hotel, but dined at Makansutra Gluttons Bay and lunched at Lau Pa Sat, both within walking distance.  The negative as a tourist attraction is that it also beckons those who disregard the right of other guests to enjoy the facilities. Most notably was a group of drunken soldiers who boorishly in quite distinctive accents peppered their…",5,2/28/2021

We went to this property in the evening to see Singapore at night. You get a spectacular view of the area. However you can only go to the one side of the sky deck as the rest is reserved for hotel guests. There is a $23 singapore dollar cost per person for the elevator ride. I believe if you go the the other line and say you want to get a drinik in the bar the lift price is waved. Make sure you go when its clear.  We didn't stay in the hotel as the rooms are pricey. I would stay for one night when we return just to see everything this property has to offer. Also downstairs is a Casino and big shopping mall.,5,3/2/2021
"Ive spend there 4 days, the best place in hotel is swimming pool - amazing atmosphere (music, food etc). Size of the rooms are really nice, service is really good .. but hotel is very crowded. Location is good and its just next to an amazing Park :)",5,3/3/2021
"So-so - i wouldnt classify their rooms 5-star.. Some conference-hotels i have been to are even better - pool water is quite murky - if it werent for the free breakfast that came with the booking, I wouldnt eat there again. dumplings are cold, bread is hard, selection is not so much - 2 out of 3 hotel representatives (from housekeeping, restaurant) has had difficulty communicating  Good - the view though lives up to its promise - location is perfect, it is just across the mall and the Art Science Museum",3,3/4/2021
"I would like to start by saying that anyone who comes to Singapore (even who lives in Singapore) should spend one night stay at Marina Bay sands.  I am European, as one of them I am used to have a different concept of “high class”. Despite the level of luxury, MBS is rapidly becoming the icon of Singapore, that’s why it worth trying it out.  There are thousands reviews of MBS, it doesn't make any sense to write one more. Who wants to book a room will not be motivated or demotivated by one single extra review. Therefore I have decided to write this review with a different approach; by highlighting things you don't know about MBS and you should know before stepping into the property.   1) POOL & SKYPARK These areas can be accessed only with a valid room key card, which it will be…",5,3/5/2021
"I have stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on two separate occasions and I must admit, it keeps getting better. It starts when you enter the foyer with the roof seeming a mile a away and the view from the infinity roof top pool is unbelievable and makes you want to stay up there all day. The city views from the room are awesome and I would recommend you visit the gym regardless whether you go to the gym or not, as the water views are great. Never have I experienced a gym were I'm training and looking over the ocean.  The shops and cafes/restuarants are only a stones throw away and you can buy anything your heart desires. The service at times might be slow however that's due to the size of the hotel and does not take away from the overall experience. This is the only hotel I will stay…",5,3/6/2021
"we spent two nights in a deluxe room with a city view on the 39th floor, it was AMAZING, yes it's expensive but all of Singapore is and you definitely get your money's worth, food is amazing, staff real friendly and eager to help. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is very nice and offers a unique view of Singapore.  This is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere, I used to think the Ritz Carlton in Singapore was the nicest but the Sands beats it hands down.  If your looking to be pampered this is definitely the place to stay.",5,3/7/2021
"I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands 10+ times and what keeps me coming back are the Staff, Restaurants/Bars and of course the fabulous pool! The hotel is still fairly new but the room have become dated quickly and often smell like mildew. When i travel to Singapore i always stay here at least for one night before transferring to the Ritz or Mandarin Oriental which have similar if not lower priced rooms. The only reason i make that transfer is because I can't take the rooms for any longer but have to spend at least 1 day at the pool! The rest of the property is absolutely stunning and its not in a bad location with a mall and casino attached.   I hate not being able to give this property 5 stars because of how many rooms i have stayed in unimpressed. ( Basic -Club - Suite )",4,3/8/2021
We arrived late evening (around 8pm) and had no problem in checking in the young lady (Wish I had taken a note of her name) was very friendly and welcoming gave us a room on the 44th floor looking over the bay of gardens and the harbour. As it was dark when we arrived was not able to appreciate the wonderful view until the following morning and what a view!! The staff on the concierge desk were extremely friendly and helpful if you are thinking of taking a bus tour or visiting Raffles or any other type of trip make sure you ask them as they can get you special deals or make reservations. The infinity pool is amazing and you just need to time it right to avoid the crowds! The room was comfortable clean and had no problems with anything at all whilst we were there. I cannot fault…,5,3/9/2021
"Marina bay sands has a reputation for being amazing. The building is and so is the sky deck and pool view. However I would say the hotel itself is average. I felt like I was in a shopping center with the amount of people there. We checked in and only one of our rooms was ready. They told us the second room would be ready in an hour and they would call us in the ready room to let us know. In the meanwhile we waited in the ready room for the luggage. 2 hours later no luggage and no phone call about the ready room. We called and finally another 30mins later we had our second room and luggage. I guess the sheer size of the hotel and the amount of guests makes it difficult for the staff to keep track of everyone. The rooms though were fantastic, really big and the bathroom was…",3,3/10/2021
"The infinity pool is a fabulous experience, and well worth doing once, but once you've done it, you've done it. The view from the hotel is fantastic, even better than from the pool if you're on the 30th floor or so (the pool is on the 57th).  The rooms are your very standard higher-end hotel though, nothing fancy. Shower only in standard rooms. Not too cramped but no feeling of opulence either. Just your standard sausage factory bigger than a cruise liner.  The buffet breakfast in the RISE restaurant is very varied, but crowded and totally overpriced.  All in all, I'm glad we've done it, but we won't be repeating the experience.",4,3/11/2021
"The Marina Bay Sands hotel has three 55-story towers with 2,561 luxury rooms and suites, and is topped by the Sands Sky Park, which offers 360-degree views of Singapore's skyline. The Sky Park is home to restaurants, gardens, a 150-meter  disappearing edge pool, and the world's largest public cantilever housing an observation deck. The building stands at a height of 200 meters and boasts 12,400 square meters. Dining options at the Sky park include restaurant Sky on 57, restaurant and nightclub KU DÉ TA, and executive club lounge The Club at Marina Bay Sands.

I had a stay of 3 nights for a conference and found the hotel to be great with very friendly and helpful staff and great facilities.  I wish I had more time to explore everything around the hotel. I would definitely go back to explore further.,5,3/13/2021
"The room was nice, comfortable but nothing special. However for the rate we paid, we were a little disappointed because it was nothing close to the other Sands’ properties in Macau and in Las Vegas in terms of size and amenities.   But who care about the room when you are going to spend all your time in the Skypark, 57 floors on the top of the hotel.  The Skypark, as the name appropriately signifies, is a relaxation area of trees and shrubbery, bars and restaurants, sun decks and observation posts where you can take in the cityscape of Singapore as in an Imax theatre. Oh, there is also a rectangular pool that runs along the park. How can I forget to mention that since the pool is what makes the Skypark famous. The pool, however, is not made for serious swimmers because it is…",4,3/14/2021
Brought my 17 old daughter and her friend her for 3 nights on the final week of a 3 week Vacation while she was staying with me from the UK . We stayed Tuesday Wednesday Thursday still very busy even during mid week . Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here so much to do and see and the place is buzzing all day and night .,5,3/15/2021
"The hotel is definitely overpriced: yes, the room was spacious, new, clear and well equipped,, but it was a room of good business hotel like Hilton for the price of luxury hotel. In fact at least 1/3 of the price was paid for the access to roof swimming pool. The pool is actually nice and the view from there is really fantastic, but I'm not sure that it worse paying so much for it. In the room there was a comfortable bed and iron facilities, but nothing to hang up wet bathrobes on and no possibilities to dry swim wear. Also no furniture on the balcony. The lobby is overcrowd and not cosy.",4,3/16/2021
"Stayed here for a night last week with my wife. We were visiting Singapore for two days and just HAD to spend a night here to check out the views from the rooftop infinity pool. The room we got exceeded our expectations. We knew this was a very nice hotel but the size (especially for an urban Asian hotel) and decor of the room surprised us. Fruits and chocolates were also waiting for us in the room - nice little bonus there. The infinity pool provides excellent city views but is very crowded. The hotel is somewhat convenient - depending on what you're looking for. It is located along the eastern edge of the bay, where there is a massive mall with many high end boutiques, restaurants, and also a casino. The MRT subway station is closeby as well. To get into the central business…",5,3/17/2021
"Stayed in this hotel for a business event.  Paid a room rate that almost doubled other 4-5 stars in Singapore.  Hadn't try to research and compare it to other hotels at the time of booking because (1) it was ""the"" event hotel; and (2) it was supposed to be new and one of the best in town.  At the end, the stay was very disappointed due to low WIFI speeds, weak shower, poor air-con that gave me sweaty nights, queuing for breakfast, wrong information from help desk, etc.  You wouldn't expect a 3-4 star hotel facilities/services and average decor from the Sands, would you ?",2,3/18/2021
"Only 4/5 because it was a bit overrated for the amount I payed per night. I was expecting the bedrooms to be phenomenal but it was pretty average for a 5 star and renowned hotel. Nonetheless, the room was spotless and customer service was faultless. Best part of the hotel would be the infinity pool, wish it was open 24/7 instead of just until 10/11pm.",4,3/19/2021
"Check in took over 30 minutes as the receptionist was unable to find our booking, which was frustrating after a long flight.  We stayed for 2 nights. Room was a decent size. Bed was comfortable. The cleaners cleaned our room daily.  View from infinity pool was stunning. Only hotel guests are allow to use this facility. However, the pool is overcrowded most hours of the day.  Given average rating as the only brownie point is the infinity pool. ",3,3/20/2021
1. Excellent rooms with a big bathroom and balcony 2. Wonderful swimming pool with a stunning view 3. Great shopping mall attached 4. Connected to MRT station 5. Fantastic valet service  There's nothing more you could possibly ask for. Always been my top hotel choice in Singapore!,5,3/21/2021
"Stayed at this hotel from 18th Jan to 20th Jan. Held my Wedding Banquet there as well. Stayed at their Orchid Suite. Every single detail was well taken care of. There is complimentary in-room dining for 1 night , champagne , chocolates , cake. Not to mention the complete view of Gardens by the Bay. Morning breadfast is great as well. If I need to pick on something, it would be that the hotel is flooded with guests :)",5,3/22/2021
"MBS was simply amazing. The rooms were clean, tidy and beautifully furnished. My room had a lovely view of gardens by the bay. The infinity pool there is amazing with spectacular views of the town. It was the highlight of my trip what can I say! Definitely recommend it to anyone who visits Singapore.",5,3/23/2021
Very nice modern buidling. Staff very helpful. Food at the buffet restaurant is very good (but not cheap) Big shopping mall with lots of restaurants and casino within the hotel. The 150meters swimming pool at the top floor is something to do if you are travelling to Singapore.  Recommended for families and couples,4,3/24/2021
"This hotel is big, lots of people and visitors. Yes Expensive, questions if it was worth it? Well tick in the box for sure just a little expensive but great for something special, great view, pool on roof a must see and enjoyable to use but also very crowded and not relaxing as one would normaly expect on a holiday, stayed 3 nights and all was very good, no complaints about service, staff and hotel was cleanest I have seen, every query to staff was treated with the greates of respect. Did not enjoy their breakfast, though food is excellent and plently of it (far to much),  far to busy, seems some nationalites are not as polite nor patient as others when it comes to buffet meals. Paying so much for breakfast we did not expect such a ""Food Court Feel"". View from our room over the…",5,3/25/2021
"Stayed her for a business trip and was utterly impressed with the views and the room. As one of my colleagues would say - you will not find an infinity pool with a better city view than that at MBS. The hotel is nicely appointed, well connected to amenities and the room is spacious with glorious views of either the bay or the city. The only downside is that it can get very crowded, and you will feel it despite the size of the property. Part of it is just the number of tourists that throng the ground floor and the pool level - the hotel attracts a lot of visitors beyond its guests. I took a swim at 6 am in the morning and was pretty shocked to find quite a number of people already there at the infinity pool.  Overall a great hotel and I would definitely stay here again",4,3/26/2021
I booked 2 nights staycation to celebrate my best friend's birthday. Oh my! Marina Bay Sands is the BEST hotel i ever stayed! The staff was VERY proffesional. VERY polite.  The room is soooooooooo beautiful! I love the bathroom & the comfortable bed!  But the most thing I love about this hotel is...  THE INFINITY POOL!! Worth every money spent!  I will be back! I promise!,5,3/27/2021
"This hotel is excellent. Though the receptionist is only a trainee, but the service is excellent.  When you check out, the manager will be there and he could also help you to check out by using his ipad.",5,3/28/2021
"I've stayed at this hotel numerous times, but have never felt the urge to get into the pool. I guess the great number of guests in it at all hours is a little off-putting. However, I have enjoyed their gym and spa. Fabulous massages and foot reflexology services. Food in their various restaurants all delicious - i especially like dining right on top - next to the pool area. Breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Hide Yamamoto serves great Japanese food and sake.  Getting to the MRT is easy. Catching a cab anywhere is easy too. It's such a lovely hotel - stay in and don't go out, just enjoy the facilities.",4,3/29/2021
"We took a pre Christmas break to Singapore. Stopping at the Marina Bay Sands was a joy, although there was lots of people, not surprising with about 2,500 rooms, there was lots of space. We stayed in the Grand Club rooms, a little more expensive but very well worth the money. We had the use of the Club lounge/restaurant on the pool deck 54 floors up (lounge now moved one floor below) The room included a stunning breakfast array, no matter what nationality you are, your breakfast is there. Afternoon tea with a typical English feel, scones (various) jam and clotted cream. Cakes were plentiful as was the supply of various teas and other beverages. The highlight was the evening canapés, in truth much more with a fantastic selection of both hot and cold meats, fish and cheese,…",5,3/30/2021
Stayed here for Four nights. Most rooms offer great views of either Singapore Skyline or Gardens by the Bay. Service is fast. Staff is courteous and food is decent with good mix of various international Cuisine.. .,5,3/31/2021
"Right so obviously money can't be an issue because this is expensive in an eye-wateringly expensive city. However, if you want an absurdly luxurious experience, the Marina Bay Sands is your hotel. You could spend your entire stay in the infinity pool on the roof and it would be money well spent. If you wanted to pop the question, as a friend of mine did, then this is the place to do it.",5,4/1/2021
"I stayed in this hotel for two nights for business. The property is well run, considering how busy this place is. The service is pretty good. I wouldn't say the rooms are spectacular. Yes, the pool is pretty amazing, and I really enjoyed working on my laptop on one of the poolside chaises. Overall, I recommend.",4,4/2/2021
"Stayed one night at this hotel to swim in the rooftop Infinity pool. Very expensive even without a complimentary breakfast although it is a very impressive looking hotel from outside both in the daytime and at night. Get to the other side of the waterfront for a good view of the hotel at night. 3 towers connected at the rooftop by the pool which is accessible only to hotel guests which was why I decided to stay here for one night. The view from the Infinity pool area was impressive. On one side, you can see the new Singapore Garden by the Bay (within walking distance if you don't mind the tropical heat & humidity, construction almost complete in May 2012) and the sea, and on the other side the city of Singapore, the river/canal etc. At night, you can see the colourful lights…",3,4/3/2021
"It was our one night stop when travel from Phuket to Melbourne. My husband said he would not careless if he does not see other part of Singapore this trip. What he wanted to do was soak up in the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. And YES we did, we spent all afternoon soaking up the sun and dipping in pool with a few drinks poolside. It was a heavenly experience. There were plenty of pool staff and they kept our drinks coming.   Our room is located on 33 floor on third tower. The view was priceless; look over on Garden by the bay. Grand view both day and night. Loved it when we put our key card in the socket and the curtains opened up automatically which made it feel like the room was happy to see us walk-in.   Our room is very clean and decorated with top quality…",5,4/4/2021
"We stayed two nights in this hotel 14-16 January. Hotel exterior is fantastic, interior not so much. The best part - the view from the swimming pool at the sunset. Kudeta bar has amazing view also, though poor quality of the cocktails. Rooms ordinary, clean and tidy, not as much impressive as the exterior of the hotel. The worst part - poor breakfast for 5 star hotel, one day we even had to wait 15 minutes to be seated as all the tables were occupied. Never happened for me in 5 star hotel before. Reception staff not professional enough for 5 star hotel.",4,4/5/2021
Stayed for one night in tower 2 with a garden view. Check in was quick considering the amount of people. The room itself was just ok. The amenities need to be presented better i suppose. However the toilet is spacious. The deco is simple and modern where the view makes up for it. The breakfast in the lobby was not up to par for a 5 star hotel. The infinity pool looks amazing. In terms of value for money is not as good as other places. Overall the hotel is ok.,3,4/6/2021
"The pool has an amazing view - it does get crowded in the afternoon though. Best time to visit would be early morning when it opens (I went around 6am and it was empty), or in the evenings when the kids have left.   The hotel itself is in a really convenient location. There's shops and restaurants underneath- and it's connected to a MRT station too. You can watch the light and water show just outside at the event plaza, and there's a really great view of the botanic gardens.   Ask the receptionist for the highest floor they can find! ",5,4/7/2021
"We stayed here on the 9th - 12th of December.   The room we had booked was for a double bed. When we arrived the woman on reception informed us there was limited double bed rooms, so we were put in a twin room. (Not ideal for £200+ a night).  The room was quite basic and on a low floor, even though when booking we requested a high floor.   The pool and other hotel facilities were 5 star.  The food was very nice but overpriced at times especially 'CUT' expect to pay $200pp.  Overall good hotel with a stunning pool that you won't get anywhere else. ",5,4/8/2021
Went to Singapore on a work conference in July...stayed in Marina Bay Sands...and I have to admit...it was absolutely amazing!!! From the infinity pool...to the comfortable bed...from the spacious room to the beautiful balcony views...it was un parallel.. I attended the marina bay conference facilities - top notch... The shopping complex had all major brands....people were friendly...it was central...and made for a memorable trip!  Will definitely stay again...,5,4/9/2021
"This is the best hotel in Singapore. Exotic view from the top floor and pool in the 52nd floor is just amazing. Kids will really enjoy the pool. Pool is only for the guests so you won't have much crowd, good for friends and family. A fantastic spot in Singapore. Don't miss it.",5,4/10/2021
"Granted, the Infinity Pool will knock your socks off if you want to go and check it out. You need to be Hotel guest.  We felt that for the price of the room that other parts of our MBS's experience were not up to scratch. We arrived late around 11pm and there was no-one working to help with baggage. Check in was efficient, luckily there was no queue as they only had one staff member on the desk in Tower 3.  We could not fault the room. Very high standard as you'll read in these reviews. We took a garden side view and we asked for as high a room as we could get at check in and were given a room on the 28th floor which we were very happy with. All room service was impeccable. Avoid 34th floor, especially 3415, 3416, 3417, 3418 if you can as these are right next to lifts where…",3,4/11/2021
"We stayed at the MBS over New Years 2014/2015 and what a great stay! Started with the private transport from the Airport, VIP registration in the room (what a pleasure not to stay at reception :-) ). Huge room on the 53rd floor with stunning views over the river bay and Singapore town.  We managed to jump into THE pool and enjoyed ourselves. Towel service is available as well as Newspaper. Bit windy up there I have to admit but oh so special.  We would like to go back to Singapore merely to stay at this Hotel!",5,4/12/2021
"The roof top pool was awesome, you can try to go there at night it will be very nice view. The breakfast was good with many choice. Because the Hotel was so many guest, checj K in and check out must be more patience to queing. Maybe the management can find the best solution for this check in and check out process.",5,4/13/2021
" We had a club room, which was a little bigger and rather nice. BUT it came with the inclusion of the Club Lounge which has Breakfast, Morning Tea, Afternoon Tea and Canapé @ Sunset. All this included in our package and if was so worth it. Damn it was good, especially after a few French champagnes. ",5,4/14/2021

The Hotel is really nice given the size and the service is excellent. The usual selfie in the rooftop pool is a must. There are also professional photographers to do this for you. Next time I will of course pick the Raffles.,5,4/16/2021
was there on a holiday with my family and had a wonderful time . this is my second visit to this property and would love to come again  the pool at the top floor is amazing and also the bar excellent view of the city from there. Was very happy to have at least one room when we checked in very early and also the second room was given to us before the time they promised .i stayed in the tower three but last time i stayed in tower 1 which for me had better rooms and view from the rooms but anyhow enjoyed my stay in the hotel.As i have already written to them before the wifi this time was not so good and was most of the time inactive this they need to improve,4,4/17/2021
I am very impressed by the services provided by MBS staff and the concierge team of the hotel. Erin ONNU concirge has provided good attention to all the guest which I found were under some or the other mess. Few things which I saw while I was awaiting for my room to be made. Even my dinner reservations and other help was provided in good manner by them.  Three cheers for MBS team and Erin ONNU thanks for ur hospitality ,4,4/18/2021
‘Tis all that it is reported to be… rooms are large and well-appointed… there’s a lovely coffee place with amazing almond croissants in the lobby…the hotel connects to the most high class shopping mall we have ever wandered through in any city… the Ku De Ta skybar makes outstanding drinks to sip while enjoying a spectacular view… and the true coup d’etat of the senses is the infinity pool: definitely the most expensive Christmas photo we have ever taken!,5,4/19/2021
This is a huge complex  - everything on a grand scale - but done with relaxed Singaporean elegance and style without the cringe feeling you can get in other parts of the world.  The 57th floor infinity pool and the views of Singapore make it great value  - yes it may be expensive for a drink up there but what would you expect  - go to a ground floor bar along the river if you want a cheap drink.,5,4/20/2021
"The roof top with swimming pool is quite spectacular, although somewhat crowded. The rooms are nice - ours had a private balcony with a sea view, but perhaps not worth the somewhat steep price. Service level somewhat below par, long queues for checking in and out.",4,4/21/2021
"We went to stay at the Marina Bay Sands as a post cruise stay and with this being such an iconic building we really wanted to stay. It was a little more than we wanted to pay but thought it would be worth it.  The rooms were great and clean and the location was amazing and our room had great views.  They wanted to collect another S$200 as a deposit on check in (and after a cruise is was money we certainly didn't have spare) they allowed us to not pay so long as we didn't use the mini bar or room service.  That aside, the location was amazing, next to the botanical gardens and there was a shopping centre under the hotel.  The only downside for us was that it wasn't exclusive.  We paid extra for a hotel that we thought would be for hotel guests only. But the iconic infinity pool,…",4,4/22/2021
its one of the best hotels ever visited.... we had booked this hotel for one day as part of my honeymoon....but beyond doubt..it was the most memorable day of the entire trip... everything here was exceptional...the room we booked was the city view type and it was amazing...the size of the room was huge... The swimming pool is the USP of this hotel.... its on the 52nd floor...and nothing can match that....simply outstanding.. the breakfast buffet was sumptuous...it had everything one could think of... overall an amazing place...and a must visit if you goin to Singapore...its worth all the money you spending there...,5,4/23/2021
"I planned a surprise for my husband on his birthday and we went to Singapore. Since the stay was just for 2 days, I booked Marina Bay Sands premier rooms... We landed in Singapore early morning and reached the hotel after the overnight flight. We had already requested for a early check in... Instead of being courteous and nice, the staff was rude and clearly said that the rooms will not be available before 3 pm. There was an extremely long queue for check in and was a complete turn off... The rooms were decent and had the view of the dock area... When we reached the infinite pool in the evening... It was over crowded and had no place to even stand... A complete turn off.. We were so upset with the situation that we dint feel like entering the pool. I would recommend other hotels…",2,4/24/2021
"Quite spectacular. We had ocean view room which was appointed very tastefully. The balcony made all the difference in the world. We only had one night and could not get late check out due to high occupancy so we were very rushed to experience all we could.We had dinner at the KU DE' TA -skypark. While the view was spectacular and service very good we found each of our selections to be overpowered with spices, a bit disappointing. Hotel is very hi tech, and huge. Shopping mall is very big and offers all anyone could want (except low prices). We played in the casino for a little while, it's quite gorgeous but we found getting drinks a bit difficult. Breakfast buffet was quite good, about what one would expect from a property of this standard.  We had a bout 15 minutes available to…",5,4/25/2021
"Lovely hotel, great roomtop bar and restaurant with stunning views. Went to the casino, it was worse than trying to get through immigration at USA. Once in it wasn't worth it, we played craps and got constant glares from serious Asian gamblers around the table, apparently fun isn't allowed, we ended up leaving as the other customers were so agressive",4,4/26/2021
"This hotel was spectacular!  We only really wanted to go to the infinity pool but you can only go there if you are staying at the hotel, so we bit the bullet and booked a room.  It was expensive, sure, but this place is a destination in itself.  There was plenty to do, we didn't even go to the casino but those places are usually pretty depressing anyway so I consider this a good move by us.  The lights show on the harbour was something to see.  the shops were off limit to my wife but they looked nice from the outside.  The indoor non ice skating rink was different, it wasn't packed so I couldn't blame my defensive skating style on excess traffic.  We stayed in tower 3 and the rooms were pretty special.  Our balcony overlooked the gardens by the bay and was a kickass view so that…",5,4/27/2021
"Great hotel to use as a luxury stopover on a long haul flight. Our journey from Scotland to austrailia was split with a night in Singapore and the Marina Sands Bay was a perfect choice.  Pay the extra for a delux room with city views and you won't be disappointed. The fabulous views over the city and bay made it difficult for us to leave our room. The famous infinity rooftop pool is amazing, although the bar is looking a bit tired. The room attendant was very helpful. Looking forward to my next visit.",5,4/28/2021
I have been there in November 2014 and I have to say that I went there 10 times during my stay in Singapore because I had a crush on Marina bay . It is a very romantic  place for couples and you can stay there enjoying that place in a beautiful silence and it becomes better when it's night. You must enjoy that relaxing place !,5,4/29/2021
"Big big hotel with a incredible design! Even with 2500 rooms the service is very good. Rooms more than OK. Loved Singapore (city, nation, country, island...), even if is the more expensive city of the world. The 57th floor pool is splendid... The breakfast is also full of good stuff and the service is very friendly. We know that there is other very good hotels in Singapore, but if you stay only once in your life-time the Marina Bay Sands is a must.",5,4/30/2021
Fantastic bathroom! Room with a view of the city.  A short stroll to the beatiful Gardens By The Bay and of course the Sky deck is not to be missed. In my opinion the only minus was that due to the size of the hotel it lacked a personal feel. ,4,5/1/2021
"I enjoyed staying at this hotel. Great staff, very helpful. Loved the pool , the view and location. Well worth stopping here. Loved the atmosphere . Very central to a number of attractions in Singapore  Tip - book early, ask for a room with a view",4,5/2/2021
"We stayed in this hotel over Xmas and we would have to say it is without doubt the best hotel experience we have encountered. The hotel is huge and it takes a while to navigate your way around, however once you get a feel for the place it is a fantastic base due to its location and to enjoy the spectacular hotel and rooms. Unfortunately the weather was inclement and the rooftop pool was extremely windy, but how can you not be in awe of an infinity pool that's on the 57th floor with views of the city, stunning. We received a welcome cake on our arrival, which was lovely! Our room on the 47th floor afforded a view that was breathtaking and could not be faulted. I really don't believe there was a negative aspect to the whole experience.... Just go and enjoy, you won't be…",5,5/3/2021
"Went there after our wedding. The receptionist asked us upon check in if we were celebrating anything so we told her we just got married. She made sure we got a room with a really nice view of the Bay which was very thoughtful. A complimentary plate of chocolate covered strawberries was also delivered to our room.:)  The pool was really cold at that time so we weren't able to swim as much, but I would love to go back!",5,5/4/2021
"This is a good hotel.  Can't really say anything negative about it - all in all, went to Singapore for 3 nights, stayed here because we wanted something convenient and wanted to visit the pool.  The rooms aren't the best for the price, but you're pretty much paying for the pool and the shopping center etc.  Hotel transfers were a bit expensive though @ 120USD - (usually 20$ by taxi)  Pool is always packed!",4,5/5/2021
"The Marina Bay sands hotel is a Singaporean icon which, although we did not stay there, was a place we had on our list of places to visit in Singapore.  The hotel is breathtakingly large and has a vast array of shops which you could spend days wandering through.  From a distance the building itself is amazing against the horizon and as you approach you take in the amount of work that would have taken to have an immaculately structured attraction as the centre piece for tourists and locals alike.  The shops and restaurants range from affordable to high end which caters for all tastes.  We wandered to the bar on Sky 57 and found that the views from here were incredible as you get to see the gardens from up high as well as take in the city from a different perspective.  I would…",5,5/6/2021
"I stayed at Marina Bay for a few nights. It is definitely a luxury hotel. Stuff was extremely nice and late check out wasn't a problem. The view from the pool on the top of the building is amazing! It is also very easy to go sightseeing from this place as the hotel is situated in central Singapore and there is metro station just below it. Staying at Marina Bay and having a swim in its pool was on my bucket list;) If you visit Singapore firtst time, this is where you should stay! ",5,5/7/2021
"Huge, huge hotel. Went with my extended family, from my parents, siblings, spouses and kids. All in all we booked 4 rooms, all in Tower 3. There are 2 entrances to the hotel, both entrances with their own taxi stand. Tower 1 is near the main entrance and it is near the reception area. Tower 3 at the other end of the building. If I were to choose, Tower 1 would be the most convenient. Tower 3 second choice.   The amazing swimming pool is a must see. Water is freezing cold though. Maybe because we went in December. For you swimmers out there, don't expect to do laps though. It is not one continuous pool but rather 3 sections. Each section is long enough to do laps in but people will be wading in and out of your lane.  Rooms are spacious enough and well appointed. Whatever you need…",4,5/8/2021
"Marina Bay Sands is just amazing! I spent 4 nights with my family and we had a wonderful time, especially when we spent time at the pool, its a must visit spot when you stay in Marina Bay Sands. All of the staff are awesome, really well done on providing us an outstanding service! recommended to try for experience seekers.",5,5/9/2021
"We have chosen Marina Bay Sands because we were aware of the fact that the Infinity Pool is only available for hotel guests. As we were ending our holiday, we were looking forward for a bit of pampering. Unfortunately, the overall experience was okay, but not amazing as one would have expected.   The main problem comes with the size of the hotel, it's massive and thus there are just too many people everywhere - in the lobby, in the pool area, in the elevators. The rooms were nice and clean, I had no issue with that, we used the laundry service, we were happy. Our room was on 5th floor, garden view and was badly soundproofed from outside - even with the balcony closed I could hear all of the traffic from outside.  My biggest problem is that the hotel is simply not good value -…",4,5/10/2021
Went to Singapore with some of my colleague past few month. Choose this hotel for the trip. The hotel was very clean and the swimming pool was amazing you could see the town view while you were swimming! It is really worth the money.,5,5/11/2021
"This is an Iconic landmark hotel in Singapore. Its expensive but worth the visit and experience.  When u arrive at the hotel staff are very polite happy to unload your luggage and give you a receipt and guide you to the reception. At the reception you might have to wait long at times depends on the kind or room you check in too. while you wait in Q staff comes and makes sure you are in the right que and takes your booking details. Allow 30-40 Mins for check in, if your room is not ready then allow another 1 hrs. to actually check into the room!! This happened to us but we are not complaining as we spent our time on top of the hotel enjoying the great city and sea view.  The room we checked into was very large, luxurious , toilets were huge as well. The view from the room was…",4,5/12/2021
"Arriving at the foot of this building and thinking about everything it contains, you've can only say wow. I booked knowing there was the rooftop infinity pool you had to swim in, the casino an adjoining shopping centre at it's foot you need to visit and a city with amazing diversity you needed to see.   The process for checking into your room at the third tower did make you feel like cattle-class with it's amazingly long queue and obnoxious fellow tourists. But it was all up from there.   The room felt luxurious, and the television had the international channels you expect in Asia and the bathroom while clean and modern was as expected. The extra dosh spend on a room in this hotel mean you need to capitalise on visits to the Infinity pool and spa on the roof otherwise you should…",4,5/13/2021
"i was here with my family, and i do enjoy it as my dad can go to casino easily, i can swim with my sister in an amazing swimming pool, and my mom can go shopping easily .. as it is close to each other, and it was really relaxing and luxury ! nice hotel !!",5,5/14/2021
"This hotel is well worth the price.  Swimming in the eternity pool everyday is an unbelievable experience.  The ambiance of the pool side bar and restaurant and spectacular, and both come with excellent service.",5,5/15/2021
"There really is only one reason wanted to stay here and that was for the pool. We only stayed two nights in a club room. Very nice hotel, but you can tell you are staying at a place owned by a casino. Check in was overall a poor experience as we were waiting for a long time, even with priority access. The whole place just feels like a money sucking monster. There are 2500 hotel rooms at MBS which means on average I would guess there are 4000-5000 people staying there at anyone time. This gives you an idea of the 'spiciness' of the place. Its huge! For some this will be more than fine, but for us (after just staying at the FBH which is leaps and bounds better) I felt like it was a real step backwards in having a luxurious and exclusive holiday. At the end of the day I'm very…",4,5/16/2021
"Not good service for price paid.  At this price range I expect sit down check in with cold towel and drink,  what I got instead were long queues just to check in (worse than airport check in) and I had a club room so went to VIP check in but even that was mobbed!  Luckily I had provided all details in advance by email so just walked up to key card collection for which there was no queue!  Phew.  We had club room  2723 garden view was very nice not worth paying more for city view since you can get from other parts of the hotel if you want.  I liked the room,  spacious,  nespresso machine,  welcome fruit in arrival day,  late checkout to 1pm,  food almost all day long in the club on 57th floor and they did their best to cater to our gluten and dairy free diet. Thank goodness for…",4,5/17/2021
"Great hotel with a lot of facilities. Awesome views from the room, infinity pool and the skypark. Dine at the Rise restaurant, you won't ever regret it. Great quality of service. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Bit expensive but one has to be here at least once and experience the fun. A single day is not enough to fully enjoy the hotel. Make sure you stay in the hotel, shop and the shoppes at sands, go to the infinity pool and the skypark for the maximum fun. Not to forget, dine at Rise.",5,5/18/2021
"We had some friends we were visiting in Singapore, but decided for one night to stay in MBS. What a right move it was to do. As we arrived, we were greeted with a big smile and the best news - Sir - you have been upgraded to one of our Suites and handed keys to what probably has been the biggest hotel room we have ever stayed in on the 54th floor with a grand panoramic city view. Naturally with the suite came the access to the lounge and we had arrived exactly in time for afternoon cocktails. After polishing off 2 bottles of champagne with some first class snacks it was time for a night swim in the pool with the stunning views of singapore. The main challenge was to find the wife in the room, because it was HUGE. Absolutely loved Marina Bay Sands and felt sorry to leave.",5,5/19/2021
"We stayed for one night only and really enjoyed it! Amazing hotel, friendly and helpful staff, the sky park is out of this world. I don't think we will return to Singapore soon but this hotel is...  A must visit once in life!  We booked very early and had a great price. We arrived at the hotel at 10.00 am and were able to check into our room already. Fantastic service ",5,5/20/2021
"The rooftop pool is what lured us to MBS for our visit to Singapore. It did not disappoint.  We were lucky as it was not overly crowded all the visits we made to the pool.   The pool and view is breathtaking.  Initially arriving at the hotel, it was super busy in the lobby.  Fortunately, we were escorted to the VIP area which expedited our check-in.  The service of the hotel was average, which I think is an opportunity for the hotel as most guests have high quality expectations that stay there.",4,5/21/2021
"Very blessed to be staying in this hotel during my first time visiting Singapore. It really is not just limited to being a hotel. Not only was the room beautiful, the Skybar and Infinity pool were amazing. It is also so convenient as the hotel is linked to the Shoppes at MBS and Gardens by the Bay. Overall, I could not fault anything about this hotel.",5,5/22/2021
"Very friendly, quick and good service. We came 4 hours yearly of check-in, but we got our room at that time, same when we leave we had complimentary two hours after check-out time. Huge, nice, clean, good equipped, quiet   room with beautiful view, automatically opened curtains on your enter. Very good coffee shop Sweet corner on the first floor, affordable, fresh and testy. Very good mall near hotel with ""small Venice"" and boats inside we enjoyed.   Most amazing thing is swimming pool on the 57th floor. Incredible view, wet water, robes, chaise-longue, small garden, Jacuzzi, bars, restaurants. Only guests of hotel can visit swimming pool, rest of visitors pay for observation point only, without any access to swimming pool. If weather is bad, pool can be closed, but we were…",5,5/23/2021
"We were attracted to this hotel since this is such an icon in Singapore and the pool looks really fun. However, when we arrived we found the lobby extremely busy and slightly chaotic. The check in process was extremely slow. We queued up for ages and were eventually asked to move over to the VIP desk for check in. Although we booked together (separate rooms) but there were no rooms available on the same floor for us, and we ended up more than 10 floors apart. The room was very nice and had a gorgeous view of Gardens by the Bay. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean. The housekeeping staff was friendly. On our last day we tried the pool which was fun and a great spot for taking photos. One night my room smelled of burning and the staff was not that helpful. They came…",3,5/24/2021
"We chose MBS for our New Year Eve stay in Singapore with some friends. While the experience of watching the NYE fireworks from the edge of the rooftop infinity pool is perhaps once in a lifetime, the hotel itself falls short of an overall 5/5 rating.  The good: the hotel is an iconic structure in the Singapore skyline and incredibly well positioned and convenient in every way. It's a quick 20min taxi ride from the airport and has a MRT station in the basement. There is an enormous shopping arcade adjoining the building with luxury shops, restaurants and convenience stores. There's even a restaurant by Tetsuya on level 1. We found the free hotel wifi useful as it is accessible through the entire shopping arcade and restaurants. It is also positioned next to the Bay Gardens with…",4,5/25/2021
"Spent a night in Singapore, so we decided to crack it and go to the famous Marina Bay Sands!  We took the Club package to have access to breakfast, afternoon tea and The Club which is amazing. Room was very clean and HUGE with city view.  No 5 stars because of staff not being as friendly as in other hotels in Singapore we have been visiting.",4,5/26/2021
Stayed there on 23 & 24 dec 2014  Fabulous experience .  Superb hotel and superb swimming pool .  Superb observation desk .  Shall advise everyone to stay for minimum 3 nights to enjoy to fullest Had a wonderful start with VIP registration within 20 minutes and also early check in .  Really great as against rumors going that everyone has to wait for 2 hours for registration .,5,5/27/2021
"I've just spent 2 nights at Marina Bay Sands. The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is spectacular - as it should be seeing as this is apparently what guests are paying high prices for as it is certainly not for excellent service. Upon checking in we were told by reception to expect our bags within 10 minutes. 40 minutes went by so we decided to call and were told our luggage would be rushed up immediately. It took another 3 phonecalls and 1 hour and 30 minutes before our bags came to our room. During this time we asked if we could collect our bags ourselves and were told this wouldn't be possible. The hotels only response was ""we are currently very busy."" Having just flown 8 hours, I felt it was unreasonable to expect guests to wait 1.5 hours to receive their luggage.…",3,5/28/2021
"A regular visitor to Singapore, I've stayed at a few hotels. This was the first visit to MBS and whilst all the appointments were fine, the only reason to stay at this hotel is the pool. Undoubtedly, the star attraction.  The rooms are well appointed, but lack the character of other Singapore hotels.  Check-in was confusing, even for a seasoned traveler. Hotel staff were not overly helpful, nor friendly.   I can tick this off my list and won't be returning. There are other fine hotels in the city that would better value my business",3,5/29/2021
"We took the family to Singapore on our way to Vietnam and decided to stay and spend NYE at Marina Bay Sands Hotel, we arrived to the busiest hotel reception I have ever seen but the super friendly staff seemed to be able to process us without to much waiting  The food , pool , views and staff were just faultless and NYE on the roof at KuDaTa was a very special place to watch the fireworks giving a totally different perspective to anything we had seen before being at eye level when they exploded. Defiantly coming back next year.",5,5/30/2021
"Elegant, pricey hotel with beautiful rooms and friendly helpful staff. Restaurants are expensive but it is connected to the huge Marina Bay Shoppes with its Food Fair. The rooftop and infinity pool is a must with its fabulous views both day and night. Take your camera! At night slip across to the Shoppes harbour front for the light show. You'll love this hotel.",5,5/31/2021
"We had a room on the 52nd floor with a view of the city and since the building is slightly concave it looked like the window wall was almost falling out of the room. Very cool effect! Can't complain about the hotel - the room and bathroom was great, room service had a good standard and breakfast was one of the best I've had in a hotel. Top that off with the infinity pool and restaurants on the roof and you have a great hotel and tourist attraction. (Good thing though that the pool was only open to hotel guests, otherwise it would've been crowded).   The big mall in connection to the hotel is mainly just something to walk through if you don't feel like spending a lot of money. The restaurants and food court in the mall was good though!",5,6/1/2021
"This hotel is one of Singapore's  icons. That's why it's a must. Its location and architecture are incredible. You have to see and experience it once in your lifetime. However, it is not the hotel you would particularly choose to go back to if you had the choice. The rooms are nice and clean (not spectacular but of 5-star standard), the staff are always friendly and helpful ( pretty much always the case in Southeast Asia), the restaurants are of high quality and very nicely designed, and the pool is simply breathtaking. The breakfast on the top floor is also good.  The hotel's main issue, I believe, is that it is very big, almost too big to be run efficiently, to the point where it seems impersonal. The lobby is huge, always full of people going in and out, taking pictures,…",4,6/2/2021
"Quality of service for the prices is not comparable to Malaysia. Check in had long queues, in Malaysia its sit down have a cup of tea and get the room key, here its queue up even the VIP counter had a long queue.   Club room is very nice large and well laid out - you can hear traffic noise though even on 27th floor.   The Club lounge is nice but also very busy and beside the pool area.  Gym is big lots of machines also busy and not enough stretching area.  The sauna door closes too slowly so when people go in and out a cold blast comes in. The high area is only big enough for two people to sit.   For me at least there are just too many people in the hotel the pool is not pleasant  the are is crammed with loungers packed with people. The view is great if you like city scape.",3,6/3/2021
"We stay here in this hotel, we have dream all The year for this hotel and then when we arrived it was a big delusion for our honeymoon trip. No complimentary flower or bottle for us, despite our tour operator sent communication of this. Beforee singapore we stayed in tokyo Park Hyatt and it was an incredible experience.... Louis roederer champagne complimentary, flower to my wife, and a lot of amenities more in the room. When we arrived he gave us 3rd floor! You understand... 3rd floor for honeymoon.... So i return to reception where a gentle Elise changed the room with 47th floor. A lot of mess in all area of the hotel, from the main level to the top. The water of skypool is incredible freeze, i get a cold and throat ache for this. Tomorrow we leave for Maldives where i'm sure…",1,6/4/2021
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands was more of a superb experience than a hotel stay. The service, facilities, and exclusivity of the hotel and surroundings is truly amazing. We stayed in a deluxe double room, which was huge! The view of the gardens by the bay was breathtaking. We spent most of our stay on the infinity pool, which was an experience in itself. Awesome view of the whole city and light show at night, with great service from the waiting staff. The hotel staff also treated us slice of cake as we celebrated our anniversary. If you have the money, or like us felt like treating yourself to a once in a lifetime experience, we would definitely recommend staying here!",5,6/5/2021
"Upon reaching at the hotel it was 3:50PM, the Front Desk Gentleman told us the room we booked is not yet available and requested us to wait for 1 hour to 1 and half hour. As we have luggages with us, the Front Desk Gentleman reccomended us to keep the luggages with the Concierge, instead of requesting the bellboy to collect our luggage he requested us to walk over to the concierge, well, as the hotel is a busy hotel we thought that's fine to walk. Reaching at Concierge than we found out they don't have Safetybox to keep our laptop and other valuable belonging.   Roughly an hour later, we came back to collect the room key. Sadly, they didn't arrange any highfloor room for us, well this time still we thought, that's fine as long as they arrange garden view. After taking the room…",1,6/6/2021

"We stayed here for 2 nights on our stop over to China during December Xmas period- booked two rooms in Tower 1 to find both clean and modern. Our corner room was missing a shower though - only had a bath option where the other room had both? Besides this, right from the beginning where our driver greeted us at Changi and escorted us to the car through to the drop off at the underground Paiza entrance, staff were available, welcoming, and friendly to greet us during our stay. The views are epic, guest facilities including bar and infinity pool make this attraction unique and inviting. We had no opportunity to check out the gym.They should consider making free/special entry for Marina Bay Hotel guests to the club on Level 57 after 9pm as the entry fee for post 9pm is a rip off and…",5,6/8/2021
"Large generic impersonal hotel that lacks character or charm. Rooms and facilities a little tired.  We rented four premier rooms for a family 3 night stopover on our way home from a family vacation- Our adult children 24-28 were also very underwhelmed. While some of the staff were very helpful and polite, some were extremely rude and uninterested.  On a positive note the view over then Marina gardens and bay was nice. Very accessible to train.",3,6/9/2021
"I understand why there are so many mixed reviews, the hotel is massive it has 2500+ rooms, so if you happen to arrive and check in in a busy time it can be a nightmare.  Luckily for us, when we arrived, the computer system was down, so we were showed to VIP check-in area. We arrived around 12-30 but were told our room isnt ready till 3pm, but we can leave our bags and get access to the Sky pool. We booked deluxe room for 1 night, but were upgraded to Club room. (i reckon its because we booked directly on Marina Bay website not on one of those hotel booking websites.) Room was very nice and facing Gardens by the Bay, the pool was amazing. Yes its expensive but its so worth it.",5,6/10/2021
"I booked online last week of November for a stay here that included new year's eve. There were only a few rooms left that has city view. For the price we paid I was expecting to be in one of the higher floors but maybe those higher floors were the first to be booked so if you want them, maybe book earlier!  We still got city view but only on the 16th floor, the view is still pretty awesome though. The skypool has got to be one of the best views of any pool on earth. The water is a bit cold and on one afternoon we were swimming the smell of chlorine on the water was pretty strong. In the mornings though the water is pretty much okay. Staying here you're just a few steps away from the 'Shoppes' where you can get stuff from most of the better known brands imaginable. On the other…",5,6/11/2021

we brought our Mums over to Singapore for a holiday and we had to stay here at this Magnificent Hotel as I had stayed here about 12 months ago and certainly wasn't disappointed back then. Well I can tell you that our Mums were simply amazed at how wonderful this Hotel is. And the check in process was excellent and when we got up to our rooms our bags were not too far behind.  We then took them up to the SkyPark to have a look at the pool and the view.  They said it was one of the most amazing things they had seen so we stayed up there and had some drinks and something to eat to enjoy the view a bit longer.  Having spent 3 nights here I can say it is truly an amazing place and being able to easily walk across to the Shopping Forum complex where the Casino is also located is…,5,6/13/2021

"We stayed over for 1 night in this hotel on our way to Australia. The staff were so helpful. The hotel was so dynamic and unique with its rooftop pool, breakfast catered for all. The rooms were so comfortable and cool. Stunning views of the Harbour. We went to the rooftop at night to see the amazing view at the cocktail bar... Staff werent the happiest people which was slightly disapointing but apart from that a fan hotel ",5,6/15/2021
"Service was immaculate! Room and bathroom were large. The balcony was as large as the room with a view of The Gardens by the Bay. Infinity pool was breathtaking! We stayed over the weekend so the rates were quite hefty and worth every penny!  It would have been fantastic to have patio furniture on the balcony. I wondered why there wasn't one. The pool was frigid cold but the sun helped. Wished the pool was a tad warmer. The jacuzzi was filled to the brim with folks jammed in it so we avoided it.   I expected better food by the pool but it was the same blah food i.e. fries, fried calamari etc. All in all it was fantastic! We felt on top of the world in the pool which was a surreal experience!",5,6/16/2021

If you get off the lift on ground level , it feels as if you are  in the middle of a busy street.  We wanted to use a computer , and had to go to expo hall , via shopping mall ? . A long walk . With such premium prices charged , why can't hotel install in room?",5,6/17/2021
"It was really a pleasant stay of two nights in October 2014. All round cleanliness, service and convenience was excellent except the front desk where it seemed not so welcoming. It was a very busy morning as a lot of guests were checking in and out. But still it is not acceptable as the front desk is the place where each and every guest gets the first image about the hotel. We made our reservation well in advance with the type of rooms we wanted, but as we traveled early in the morning from Jakarta and reached there around 10a.m., we were informed that the counters were closed for registering even. Though we wanted to go out, we had to waste some time until they open. And we were given a room on the 3rd floor with a road view when we had asked for a higher floor with garden view…",5,6/18/2021
We stayed here for 4 nights. The rooms are spacious but nothing special about it. It's just like any other 5 star hotel. Even the corridors to the rooms is just plain simple for a 5 star hotel. The structure itself is great but the rooms plain simple.,3,6/19/2021
We had to experience this Hotel which is an amazing engineering feat. Especially the infinity pool on the roof. It must have been so challenging. The rooms are beautifully appointed but that was all we liked. We are elderly and found the whole experience too much. I guess if you are looking for something very different  have the patience of a saint to get around such a massive Hotel then it might be for you. We like more of a personal touch that you get with a boutique hotel. The checkin took forever I think about 45 mins as it's such a busy hotel.  I felt as if I was in Grand Central Station.,2,6/20/2021
"Impressive building but the complex is too big to be bothered with families.I suggest you look elsewhere because you could do better. Rooms are smaller than expected and I did not like the bathroom configuration for families. The complex really doesn't cater for family food requirements either. While the pool is a feature, you do not get full access to facilities and they were not able to explain the levels of access. Not a five star experience.",3,6/21/2021
"a/c is too cold. I even tried to put it on hottest but still it was cold. I turn it off It gets warm but then there is no air to breath. Otherwise it's a wonderful hotel by all other criteria.

Christmas morning was very exciting when the kids found out we were heading there for the day. This was an experience of a lifetime, from the moment we walked in the door it was exceptional. The staff were professional but warm and welcoming, they couldn't do enough for us and made us feel like royalty. Rooms usually aren't available until 3pm but I was informed we could check in and use the pool facilities whilst waiting for our rooms.

First at all, to get a room in this hotel its not easy since the hotel fully booked and it happened everywhere during this holiday season.  We checked in 2 days before end of the year and we really excited since we love to stay in the different hotel around the world. But this was not what we expected at all from 5 star hotel. We booked 1 orchid suite and 1 premier room. Upon reservation, we ask for baby cot and extra bed, but upon checked in, they cannot confirmed to get both of our requested. I really…",1,6/27/2021
"I recently visit Singapore for my Honeymoon and choose this as our Hotel. The first thing that comes through your mind when you see this property is WOOW. The looks of this place is amazing but it dose not stop there. We booked a Club Room that guarantee a City View in a floor above 40th, the view is unenviable and you have access to The Club at Marina bay. Service and amenities in the room are perfect, treat your self and stay in this hotel. You will feel like a king, because of the great service of all the staff. The skypark is one of the most amazing things to see in this hotel (But not the only one) you will always find something to do or somewhere to go in the property. The pool is very recommended, so it is the sky57 restaurant and the nightclub. It is going to be a…",5,6/28/2021
"The staff was really nice and upgraded our room because it was a special date for us. As we requested we stayed on a high level - such a great view! We tried the gym, the pool... oh the skypool!!! Really nice and unbeliable views from there, at day and night!. The room was really spacious and clean as it was promissed.",5,6/29/2021
"I stayed here with a friend just after national day (so it was unusually busy with Singaporeans on a staycation). We were tourists spending a night in one of the biggest tourist attractions in Singapore, and that's what we expected. So we had a great time. But if you want to spend several nights there are better hotels, with lobbies that don't remember an airport departure terminal.  The room was spacious with a lovely view of the gardens by the bay, which we found preferable to a city view. There was no road noise or noise from the lobby (even though there was a piano playing and we were only on the 5th floor) so the rooms are very well insulated. As it was booked for a birthday treat we had strawberries and chocolates and a lovely fruit bowl appear when we were out. The room…",4,6/30/2021
"My sister and I stayed at Marina Bay on December 14th 2014, and had booked the special deal there. We were supposed to stay in the Deluxe room for the night, but instead we were upgraded by one of the wonderful staff to a Premium room! We were very impressed with the service - we didn't wait in line for a very long time during check in, as the staff were very efficient.  Our room was fantastic, one of the best we have ever stayed in. The views were stunning, overlooking the water and the city (I would definitely recommend a city view room). Everything was incredibly travel friendly, from complimentary water, to cotton robes and complimentary slippers. The room itself was huge, with plenty of space for two people. The bathroom was amazing, as was the shower which had plentiful of…",5,7/1/2021
"I was in Singapore for 3 days and had to stay here at least for one night. Infinity pool a once in a lifetime experience (for me anyway), room amazing, friendly staff, check in 3pm - room ready at 10am, check out was fast and efficient....... everything I would expect from an elaborate hotel. My opinion, if you indulge in anything.... maybe indulge in this :)",5,7/2/2021
"Save some money and stay there at least one night. Everything is beautiful. The swimming pool is spectacular. We spent hours there, just watching the unbelievable view. We also tried the in-room service, and really appreciated.",5,7/3/2021
"We stayed at this hotel  for only two nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We are the 'budget' type of travellers so staying there was really a treat. We are glad we did as it was really nice.   We stayed on the 20th floor and the view to the garden was astonishing. The quality of the hotel is impecable. Breakfast was absolutely amazing. So many options for pretty much every taste.  Customer service is amazing, as you would expect from a hotel this caliber. My son had a tummy bug and the doctor came to our room and we were given all the assistance needed. They called the next day and just before we left to check how he was feeling. Very professional. The infinite pool was such an amazing experience. Pity the weather wasn't that great and we missed the blue sky but still…",5,7/4/2021
"We staid there on the last day of our honeymoon trip, we booked the place only for the skypark and the infinity pool, we got what we waned and it was worth every pinny. We were lucky in many aspects, check in was quite effeceint and quick the gentleman at the front desk was very nice, he gave us our rooms very early (around 11 in the morning!) we also were given a room in the 50th floor which was really awesome! you should take the city view room, it is worth the money, its double the size and has a breathtaking view of the bay and city skyline both day and night. we staid at tower three and I dont think there is any difference (except the rooms at the other two towers are a bit more expensive). checkout was also hastle free and it took less than 30 minutes. I think everybody…",5,7/5/2021
"This is the perfect place to just relax and unwind! I've stayed here numerous times and I can't wait to go back!  The infinity pool is absolutely gorgeous; just avoid peak hours if you want to soak and sunbathe in peace. Since the pool is the main attraction, it's always packed with people. However, once you get a spot, you will get over the crowd and soon be one of those that are busy snapping away with your cameras.   This hotel has free wifi, which is a plus as most hotels make you pay for it. The wifi is strong as well, and you can access it pretty much anywhere within the MBS compounds. Room service is delightful; my friends and I ordered 3 times a day as we were too lazy and tired to get out of our rooms. We were very impressed with the food!  Do try the truffle fries at…",5,7/6/2021
"i spent 4 nights here and everything was suited to me, the hotel room has well - equipped, modern and clean, the pool on the top was unique than others hotels, the receptionist was friendly and help me many things, really appreciate all the staff. Hotel room was great and u should see the scenery on top of the baysands during your time swimming. Strange and awesome, thank you!",4,7/7/2021
"The size of the hotel is massive, and it's very easy to get disorientated especially when a bit weary from travelling. Specific lifts for specific towers and then trying to get to the infinity pool. But, in saying that, this hotel is nothing short of spectacular. The rooms are very generous, the marble bathroom incredible, the toiletries are of a high quality and all the attention to detail certainly made our stay comfortable.  The infinity pool is stunning with the most breathtaking view. Even if you don't stay here, definitely visit the hotel just to see the pool and the sky walk.  Breakfast was awesome with the view over the Bay amazing. It's a long way up....... TIP: Do not touch anything in in the mini bar fridge, there are special sensors that detect any movement and you…",5,7/8/2021
"We just felt like just wasted loads of money there. We've stayed a lot of 5 star hotels all over the world but this hotel is NOT as same as them at all. The staff is amateur and helpless. We booked two rooms and stayed on different floors. The second day, room to room phone was out of order and there was something wrong with wifi. We couldn't contact because we couldn't access to our rooms so we were looking for each other and wondering inside the hotel whole day. We wasted our day. Staff was not helpful. In the end, it was found out that was because phone system changing technical problem. If so, they should have let hotel guests know at least a day before. Very irresponsible. When we checked out, we showed Sands Reward Card and they said they charged our points. After 48 hours…",1,7/9/2021
"We loved our stay here.  We chose this hotel, as I wanted to swim in that pool! We stayed in a Suite which was lovely, but my pet hate is that there was not space in the bathroom to stow toiletries, make up etc.  Other than that it was really well appointed.  We stayed in Tower 3.  Location is excellent and we used the MRT frequently. The Skypark pool is totally amazing.  It was surprisingly cold, but quite refreshing.  The Adults only area does need to be monitored more as there were alot of kids in the spa area, which meant the quiet ambiance was destroyed!  The drinks service around the pool was a bit lacking, but we still managed to get a drink! We had Club access which was really nice too, the canapes were divine and the drinks were free poured, which meant STRONG!!! …",5,7/10/2021
"After travelling for 4 weeks trying out different hotels/motels this is the place you want to recover, relax and just enjoy the finale of your holiday. The hotel is gigantic, its located next to the beautiful Gardens by the Bay with a Skywalk, the famous Roof-pool is amazing (only for people without height problems), it has the trainline at your doorstep as for the Marina Bay Shopping (only high class shops) and Convention centre. The hotel rooms (standard) are large, clean and have extremely comfortable beds - have you ever had a button next to your bed to open the curtains? well here you do! Complimentary water bottles and cleaning service lively. Will def stay again!",5,7/11/2021
"Modern, clean, scenery is fantastic. Shoppes list are great, near to gardens by the bay and easy yo walk to other area such as merlion, esplanade makansutra, laupasat.  Hotel room was great and u should see the scenery on top of the baysands during your time swimming. Crazy!",4,7/12/2021
"The goodies: Great building, great pool area on the roof, great connection with the subway to city center, good shopping possibilities, really extraordinary service at the Club lounge at the roof (if you have a club room)  The no so good things: very anonymous, If something in your room is broken they tell you it will be fixed, but it won't (In my case it were the shades not properly closing - I asked 3 times to repair it without success), The way with the elevator to the pool on the roof lead trough a building area.",3,7/13/2021
"We stayed at the Marina Bay for 5 nights in February. We chose this hotel as we liked the idea of staying in a resort in a city. The view from the infinity pool is amazing, the pool is heated, there were plenty of sun loungers and staff around to assist with beverages. We upgraded and stayed in a room with a city view, which was worth the extra for the view and the size of the room. The only negative about this hotel was the lift card system didn't always work and this effected us on a daily basis! The attached shopping mall is a day out in itself. Very recommend! ",4,7/14/2021
"A few years ago MBS was only a dream for me. Time has passed and the dream came true. We booked a standard room for 3 days at the beginning of our holiday in SE Asia. Taxi from airport cost us S$20 and we arrived at MBS around 8.30 pm. There was nobody checking-in at that hour so check-in went very fast. We were upgraded to a Premier Room with Garden View in Tower1. We paid cash the deposit - S$200 per night, we took our key cards and up we went at 45th floor to discover our home for the next 3 days. Our room was very big with everything we desired: great comfortable bed, safe, bathrobes, slippers, complimentary water refilled daily, LCD TV, a gorgeous bath with a superb bathtube, private shower, toiletries, 2 sinks and a great marble floor. We didn't open the minibar because…",5,7/15/2021
"For the price we are paying, I expected to have a bigger room.  The two double beds were more like a super single beds.  Upon check in, we also asked for a rollaway bed.  However the front desk failed to produce it.  We had to talk to the housekeeping staff in order to get one.  The first night, we also did not have slippers in the room and the tv was not functioning.  The staff were however very efficient, each request we made were met within a few minutes.  The elevators were also very fast.  The only problem was the number of people who were in bathrobes and swim wear coming down to the lobby so they can transfer to the other bank of elevators to reach the swimming pool at the 57th floor.  We also had the breakfast buffet that came with the booking of the room.  However there…",3,7/16/2021
"Couldn't fault this hotel. Its breathtaking, staff are very friendly and the rooms are immaculate. We stayed in the club suite which comes with breakfast, lunch snacks and happy hour cocktails included. VERY worth the money.   We booked a room for two adults, and last minute had a third guest, so we were able to pop a roll away bed in the room, they brought it up straight away with extra towels, robe and slippers. Room was still spacious with third guest.   Because we only booked for two people, we had to pay for our third guest to come with us to breakfast, lunch and drinks, but again, very worth the money. Sometimes it was a little bit difficult to get our guest up to the pool... but there are helpful staff who are happy to assist with communication with other staff members.  …",5,7/17/2021
"We wanted to stay just for one day to be able to use the infinity pool on the roof and it was absolutely amazing. Would definitely recommend one night here if you can. We arrived as soon as we were allowed to check in and spend the whole time on the roof. Stunning views - just amazing - absolutely as good as it looks in the photos. The room was brilliant too, as you'd expect for the price.",5,7/18/2021
"One of the dream hotels in the world I guess. And also one of the most symbolized. As it is such a famous hotel, many people are there. I was there during the last few days of  my honeymoon. It was an experience that is worth once in a life time. The view from the pool is much more than you can imagine. The bay view from the hotel was exellent as well.  The biggest negatives of the hotl would be the people. There are so many people and they certainly lack staffs to run the hotel. It took us 40 minutes just to queue in line and check-in. The breakfast buffet was great with plenty of food and varieties, but the restaurant was packed with people. The swimming pool was always packed as well.  The number of people obviously showed that it was a famous hotel to be in. Considering the…",4,7/19/2021
"We stayed here for 1 night last week and it suited its purpose: nice room, great views from the roof top, great pool with a view and quick, easy access to Gardens by the Bay. The negatives are terrible and insanely overpriced food at Ku De Ta restaurant. Not a patch on Ku De Ta Seminyak Bali, or any other restaurant we went to during our 4 night stay. Do NOT waste your time and money on this poor food and up atmospheric restaurant. Service isn't anything special either but if you're going just to say you've been and fir the views, you can't complain.",4,7/20/2021
"My wife and I stayed in the hotel for our Anniversary, the hotel is really nice. The check-in was really fast, even thou it seems we were served by the most experienced lady in that shift for the Lobby three, she dealt with the two other colleagues operations while she checked us in. We had our room really quick which meant a lot to us. We headed to our room: Fantastic City view through floor to ceiling full wall window in a spacious room, decoration was nice, average to the category of hotels worldwide, the bed and the pillows really comfortable like sleeping in the clouds, TV selection really good, finally I did get stuck in the news channel hah! The bathroom was really good, however the shower I found it substandard, suggesting changing the shower crowns. Excellent products…",4,7/21/2021
"Me and my wife book this hotel for our staycation and Christmas celebration on 20 December in Singapore. We had specially selected this hotel out of other like Fullerton, Ritz Carlton, St Regis. However, I had to comment that we had made a wrong choice.  We pre booked the hotel room with King size bed and city view in 3 months in advance. When we arrived the hotel, the staffs told us they don't have a king size bed room for us. Either we take a twin sharing bed with a city view or upgraded to suite but low floor with garden view. So what is the option left to us is to take the suite. Will you sleep separate bed with your wife and kids for staycation? Can't the staffs use their common sense to think about it?  The view was lousy in the suite room at fiht floor. However I have no…",2,7/22/2021
"This is a lovely hotel in a great location, rooms are spacious and well equipped, all having great views of either the harbour or the city. Service is good and we were well looked after throughout our stay. Well worth the price to experience the pool. Only downside was the quality of the food both at the breakfast buffet, very ordinary and poolside. I would expect a much higher standard from a hotel of this quality. We ate outside the hotel for much of our stay after this disappointment and it being Singapore their are lots of options, many close by.",4,7/23/2021
Visited the hotel's sky bar for a drink and for the view. Wasn't disappointed! Fantastic view of the bay and the drink was also good although a bit expensive... Easy access with a wheelchair and an accessible restroom. Highly recommended!,4,7/24/2021
"Stayed here in November 2014 with my wife while on a Far Eastern tour. We were most impressed and was the best hotel that we stayed at between Japan, Bangkok and Singapore. The hotel is large and very busy. The swimming pool has to be seen to be believed. The hotel dominates the landscape and you really feel that you have stayed somewhere special even though it is Las Vegas style massive.",5,7/25/2021
"Smooth check-in , very professional staff at the front desk who allocated a high floor room to us upon request ( Gardens view , tower #3 4622 ) , the view is even better than the city , especially at dawn. The pool is awesome but you have to be there either at 06am or 10pm to enjoy it without the crowd. All in all a enjoyable experience , but for that price someone could expect breakfast to be included . Got an extra bed for my 6 yo and a baby cot for my 3 yo free of charge both , room large enough to accommodate extra bedding .",4,7/26/2021
"Marina Bay Sands hotel is truly the best hotel in Singapore. Our week stay was really an excellent choice. Swimming pool on the top is really a unique experience. Out of the wide range of restaurants the hotel is offering we have tried a four of them and it was really every time great experience.  I would like to bring up the Hide Yamamoto Japanese Sushi restaurant, which was truly outstanding!  Hotel staff is polite, friendly and very professional.   Highly recommended – its truly unique experience !!!",5,7/27/2021
"Amazing service and room.   A bit pricey for food etc but expected.   Only con, my partner had dinner there the pasta with prawns and scallops and had food poisoning the next day. It was definitely that meals as we hadn't had anything else all day prior. They helped us a lot however we refused the expensive doctor service $300.   Also they are slow to return the deposit. It still shows as pending on our card. ",5,7/28/2021
"Hotel staff is great, especially the Front Desk staff. But Ramesh Govindasamy, Front office gave an exceptionally excellent service and his warm smile makes me feel so at home. The view at Sky Park is breathtaking! But personally I feel its the staff that makes the difference. But they should have someone fix the shower head in the bathroom, but I will still definitely come back here and will definitely recommend my friends and relatives to this hotel.",4,7/29/2021
"Everything about it i like, the room was quite big tough i stay at deluxe room and the one with garden by the bay view have balcony. The rooms were amazing, modern and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very professional and friendly. They were very helpful to provide extra beds quickly for our little ones. Quick response from customer service.  I loved the quick check out option and room key return. Hotel facilities & amenities were great. The hotel was extremely clean. The design meet the standard class of 6 stars hotel. Hotel architecture is really impressive. Great ambiance. The infinity pool was really cool and amazing even if crowed. Loved the infinity pool. The restaurants on level 57 were great too.The incredible view from Sky Park and the strange atmosphere in…",5,7/30/2021
"Had a two night stay so we could experience the infinity pool and not disappointed. The service is excellent from checking in to bell hops to restaurant staff. All very professional although not that personal. The foyer and restaurant where you can choose to have breakfast reminded us of being in a large shopping centre. Our room was beautiful, (we upgraded at an additional charge) and had amazing views of the city skyline.  Infinity pool has to be experienced even just once just for the views. Great hotel, good service but pricey. Not sure if we would stay again now that we have tried the pool as it was much too busy and large for our liking. Would prefer a smaller and quieter hotel.",5,7/31/2021
"This was a desperate attempt for some year end family time after a busy year. We booked a deluxe room package a mere 3 weeks prior via the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) website, expecting a tiresome journey of logistics as we brought along our toddler and 2 month old.  5 minutes after reaching the check in counter made us realized MBS was a family-friendly hotel. We were quickly ushered to an express check-in counter after standing 1 minute at the general queue. As we drove to the hotel, we were given friendly advice to take our time to enjoy the hotel's facilities first or settle down with our kids before collecting the carpark pass, which was SGD6 for a single entry. The pass can be collected any time before 11am on our check out day.  The surprise was when we entered the hotel room.…",4,8/1/2021
"Of all the hotels ive stayed in this is the most breath taking. The marina bay sands does with with the old school charm which a lot of hotels like and instead provides this crisp, modern and clean hotel which make the jaw drop.  The views from the top are breath taking, the views from the bottom when you look up at the architectural giant are equally breath taking.   I should focus on how clean this place is, much like all of Singapore, but this takes it to the next level. Everything about the hotel is polished, and perfected. The whole building and its operation is something like a perfectly rehearsed and executed dance. Its truly mind boggling to think how an operation of this size runs so smoothly.  The room service is amazing, its not just the room service thats amazing its…",5,8/2/2021
We have stayed in this hotel previously. Spacious clean rooms on all occasions. Great service each time. The infinity pool and restaurants on that level are one of the best we have been to. Early morning and late evenings can be very relaxing up there. Perfect location if you enjoy walking or jogging. Close to all major places to visit in the city. If you are looking for a cozy warm hotel & less open to the public then this may not be the one for you. The foyer is very busy. Fortunately we have found a cozy warm hotel for our Singapore stays with spectacular views of Marina Bay Sands 😊.,4,8/3/2021
"Deciding to have a different Xmas gathering, family and I decided to have a staycation at the hotel. Check in was fast and prompt and we headed up to our rooms. Nothing bout this hotel is less than 4*, beds and pillows were all top notch in the sleep department and when you open the sliding door at the balcony, you have a awesome view of gardens by the bay, be it in the day or in the night, so waking up to that view while having your morning coffee/tea gets your day started.. Do keep in mind though for those who have a habit of clearing the mini bar to stock up on your drinks, do not! As they are all operating via sensor, so the moment you pick any drinks up, it's chargeable, you could opt to call for them to send you another min bar at a rate of $10. It's a must that you take…",4,8/4/2021
"The rooms are your standard hotel rooms. I had the view of the park which was nice at night seeing them light up. But lets be real...you stay here for access to the pool. It does not disappoint. The views are great and, because of the number of people, you can always find a seat.",5,8/5/2021
"You haven't seen S'pore if you haven't stayed at the MBS.  Brilliant Hotel, excellent location, ample amenities and a lot to do  for everyone in the family.  The rooms as large with great views of the bay front or the ocean.  Must Do things: 1. Breakfast Buffet - Excellent spread of Global cuisine at the Rise.  2. Shoppes - Probably a self sustained city in itself. You will find something for everyone 3. Casino - If your a foreign national, do visit the casino as its a beautiful place to spend all your 'extra cash' away.  4. Ku De Ta - Probably the best location to have a nightclub in the far east. MUST VISIT.  5. Sands Skypark - Last but not the least, the best Infinity Pool anywhere on the world.   ",5,8/6/2021
"This place is a huge experience, from checking in to checking out, there is always something that will amaze you!  The hotel is just a small part of the immense complex that contains shops (every top brand going - Cartier, LV etc) which are all extortionately priced as always! There are indoor gondola rides, ice rinks and 2 huge theatres. All of this is just fun to walk around, but not really an essential part of the hotel.  The reason you will be thinking of staying here is:  The rooms - the floor to ceiling windows looking out over the city skyline at night is quite special. Make sure you get a room with a city view.  The roof top pool - this is a real treat. To sit in the pool in the evening watching the sun set between the skyscrapers from the 57th floor is breath taking.…",4,8/7/2021
"First of all, my impressions of MBS was not that positive . . . from the lobby it was impressive but it was so huge with so many random people milling about (a lot of tourists who are not guests of the hotel show up to gawk).  The adjacent mall may be fancy but it doesn't really have many shops of interest to people who are not high end fashionistas (i.e., me).  But then you check in . . . and the room is beautiful with a giant balcony, super comfy bed, classy decor and excellent bathroom with standalone shower and bathtub units.  And what can I say about the SkyDeck and pool except that it is surreal to be up there, I assume if Jesus had a pool it would be like the SkyPool.  Especially amazing at night, there are plenty of chaises for everyone and good food and drinks service. …",5,8/8/2021
"The hotel is beautiful and the service is impeccable. I was handicapped at the time and was treated with kindness and lots of help. The room service food and service was also wonderful - very tasty food and superb treatment.  I do have a complaint / concern... Part of my reason for staying at Marina Bay Sands was to enjoy the Sky Park. Since I was in a wheelchair, I was moving much slower that most people and need more help. Unfortunately, I was unable to check out at the designated ""check out"" time. No one told me that I would not be allowed to visit to the sky park after check out time unless I paid an entrance fee to enter the Sky Park.   I feel that with the rates they are charging, the hotel policy should be more flexible. If I knew that I would not be allowed up to the…",3,8/9/2021
"The room was clean and the toilet was amazing, really very spacious and lightings were bright. But the windows are not clean, you can visibly see the watermarks of rain and residues when you look out of the window. A pity about this issue, especially staying in MBS is very expensive and considered a 6-star hotel in Singapore. Apart from that, the pool is nice, clean and quite big.   Overlooking at the sceneries from the pool were definitely amazing and unforgettable. During day and night was totally a different view. A truly, world class hotel to say. Recommended to drop by for shopping even not staying for an accommodation. Entry to the casino is FREE for all foreigners.",3,8/10/2021

It is an iconic hotel and I'm glad i can check it off but other than that it's just an expensive hotel with very little soul.",4,8/12/2021
"It's definitely an iconic hotel and the view at the skypark is spectacular. We were staying at the deluxe room facing Garden By The Bay, which is a plus with great day/night view! However, the room itself is just normal but the bath room is big. It was crowded everywhere, especially the renowned infinite pool, it's packed from morning till night. Don't expect to go for a swim... You'll see almost everyone dipped in the pool taking pictures or selfies. They do have a few hot jacuzzi near the pool aide cafe. Yup, always packed and unless you don't mind squeezing in between! I had to wake up early in the morning to go to the pool in order to beat the crowd!

"We stayed for 2 nights in the hotel enroute to Europe for our honeymoon and was at first taken back by the horses in the vast lobby. However, check in was a breeze, staff were very friendly and the room was excellent!! They even gave us chocolate coated strawberries and complimentary breakfast which was a spectacular buffet. If you're willing to battle the crowds, the pool is obviously breathtaking. At breakfast, despite there being what felt like over a hundred people the service was excellent! They offered is coffee done to our specific requests and offered newspapers. The gym is small but very well equiped and location is second to none. Fantastic start to our ",4,8/18/2021
"We booked in for just one night  as an early birthday treat.  Although official check in is at 3pm, we were able to check in at 11am, which gave us extra time to visit the swimming pool, we were also given an extended check out at no extra cost.  Our room was in Tower Two on the 45th floor and looked out on to the Marina, which was great as were able to watch the light show over the Marina at 9.30pm from the comfort of our room.  Room was spacious and comfortably slept our family of four. We all loved our stay and if it wasn't quite so expensive am sure I would visit again. Definitely recommend this as a special treat.",4,8/19/2021
"Booked a suite with pool table, and the entire experience was great. Located on one of the high floor, the views are absolutely stunning. The suite is about 160 sq/m and has all the required. From bar to sofa to desk to dining table, and of course a pool table. 3 large screen TVs, a printer... the list goes on. There is also a shared bathroom. The bedroom is equally large with comfortable bed, and stunning bathroom. Breakfast buffet is huge, and excellent. There is definitely for everyone's taste. We did not have the time to make it to the swimming pool unfortunately, however made it to Kudeta, which to my opinion is one of the greatest bar in Singapore. Location is of course very convenient, located right in the middle of everything. Finally, service was excellent all along our…",5,8/20/2021
"hotel is fantastic with great view to the city and the open sea, infinity pool was crowded, didn't try the hotel food and beverages, but tried the food court, way too expensive for the food quality similar to orchard food court, back to the room review, nothing fancy and lack of wow factor, room is relatively small for the tariff, with the same tariff you can get bigger room in orchard road, for example royal plaza on scotts. stay here for the sake of been there, will definitely not be staying here again.",4,8/21/2021
"We stayed at this hotel for three nights on our way to Bali and 2 nights on way back to London.  This hotel is an iconic hotel in Singapore which looks fantastic and has beautiful views over the Marina or the Ocean depending on which side your room is facing.  The Skypark is one of the main attractions of the hotel, which becomes overcrowded in the evenings. The best time to go is in the morning.  The service to the room is good and efficient.  The room is clean and tidy.  Check in and check out sometimes takes a while but depends on the time of the day.  All in all, an OK hotel but nothing that stands out as exceptional other than the Skypark infinity pool. ",3,8/22/2021
"Family and luxury mixed altogether.  We went to Singapore to celebrate the birthday of my kid and glad to have stayed in Marina Sands.  Although the lobby is not as grand as some of the hotels,  the facilities and amenities are great.  Of course,  there's the infinity pool which the kids love. Tends to get overcrowded in the morning and dawn till night but it's ok.  Lobby can get a little overcrowded too.  Overall,  the view,  room and the infinity pool are the highlights of this hotel.  If you're up for shopping in high end boutiques then this is also the place for you. ",5,8/23/2021
The hotel room is well furnished and clean with good service and value it has king size single bed and sofa.it is five star service with two complimentary nights.V ery enjoyable and good  value.will recommend to anyone to become a MBS member to enjoy the amenities and facilities,4,8/24/2021
"This large hotel with 3 towers seemed to receive mixed reviews on TA. Our own personal experience has been fabulous. We spent 2 nights there just last weekend. The porters immediately took our bags upon exiting our taxi and we were directed to the reception area, with full explanations. The guy at reception Phil, was most helpful and gave us a nonsmoking double room on tower 3, 30th floor. Spectacular views! The shower is state the art and the bedroom is beautifully maintained. We were able to enjoy a massive buffet breakfast every morning on the ground floor and use the Infinity pool on the 57th floor. There is an MRT station ""Bayfront"" located in the basement near Tower 3, past the expensive shops, which connects you to the rest of the city for exploring and shopping. And yes,…",5,8/25/2021
Beautiful  hotel... top on roof pool and view is amazing !!! Breathtaking ..a must see ..a great place to stay even provided us with a fridge as their mini bar fridge was a remove items u pay fridge  great experience would def stay there again,5,8/26/2021
I was there to make sure i visit the top most floor. The building has perfect architecture. I was so much excited to be in that building. But the thing is you need to pay for that view. So what I did was  I visited the bar on top floor for which you dont need to pay to enter. If you wish you can ask for any drink else you can take few pictures experience the view and come back.!!,4,8/27/2021
Stayed early in December. The infinity pool at the top of the building is awesome! The hotel is in a great location and convenient to a lot of attractions. The only downside was a way too long check in and out process. The restaurant on the roof had a spectacular breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,4,8/28/2021
"Room is stunning with great view. Pool is amazing. Gym is good. Check in was ok. Location is isolated from main shopping areas. Hotel is way to huge. Takes a long time to go between areas. So many guests, it's like a tube station at peak hour all the time. 99% of guests are Asian. Rooms were not ready on arrival & had to get clothes out of our bags, this was done in lobby as no private place available. Lots of other guests had to do the same. When we asked hotel about this, they just did not care. We wanted to book tours and needed tourist guidance, but concierge was useless. Most staff are so overworked and always rushing. It's a very impersonal hotel and expensive. If it wasn't for pool area, few would stay here.",3,8/29/2021
"It's amazing to view Singapore from this luxury hotel on the top of the most expensive building in the world. The Skypark observation desk  offering a 360 degree view of the sea as also the island city and infinity pool  tempting you to swim into the clouds are located 57 stories high. The hotel spreads in three towers  plus club rooms and suits upto the prestigious Chairman Suit. More than 60 restaurants , 300 shops / outlets and Casino makes this sky oasis the most spectacular one. Felt like Las Vegas shifted to sea shore in Singapore !",4,8/30/2021
"The hotel is a huge complex, but at the same time it is not disturbing at all. Had a City View Club room on the 36th floor in Tower 2. The room was large, clean and had a prefect view to the City although it was only on the 36th floor out the 55 available floors.  The Infinity Pool on the 57th is just unbelievable. There is also a small pool for kids.  The staff was very friendly and they took a good care of us.  Although the hotel is a bit far from city centre (about 1 hour walking - which we have done) usage of the MRT is recommended.  The only negative the wifi in the room. The complimentary one is with 1MB/S while the paid one is 20MB/s, but pricy.  Would stay there again.",5,8/31/2021
"Marina bay sands is a lovely hotel. However, we anticipated that it would be a little more glamorous/ up market than this. The restaurants are seriously overpriced and all located in the attached shopping centre- may have been nice to have more restaurants located in the a actual hotel. There also seems to be no dress code throughout the bars/restaurants even though they are fine dining.   The customer service is also hit or miss, they always seem rushed and it lacks a personal touch. This could be due to the sheer volume of people that stay there- the place seems extremely hectic 24/7!   The casino was also a disappointment- we found it quite depressing, nothing like any casinos we have been to anywhere else in the world. No one drinks alcohol in there and the atmosphere is…",3,9/1/2021
This building as a landmark for Singapore. Would not be complete to Singapore if not enjoy the beautiful scenery Singapore panoramic views from the high pool like above of the clouds. expensive price comparable to what obtained here.  But the situation is crowded which proves the many people who come to this place.,4,9/2/2021
"It is Great Hotel, Amazing Breakfast!!!So Complete menu buffet..Service was excellent,huge hotel, and Amazing view from Pool and Room. It;s just difficult access to pool. you should move to another Tower to enjoy the pool. sometimes you could Lost..and just 2access card from 1 room. Limited access to pool. they allow for just 2 people. Complete Socket Charge..Amazing.",5,9/3/2021
"Very exclusive situation. Great room. Full automaticly hangings, two TV's and a big bed. The amazing pool on the roof with a perfect view around the city. Expensive but it's worth it. The personal was very friedly and the check in at the lobby was not to long. Easy access to the mrt network. Over the footbridge you are quickly at the garden by the bay. The elevator has no air condition, but for these few minutes in whitch on is it, its okay.",5,9/4/2021
"This hotel has lots going for it. It's easy to get to from the airport, has excelent rooms & facilities, a spectacular infinity pool on the roof, a good gym, easy walking distance to the equally spectacular Marina Bay Gardens which are well worth a few hours walking around & literally dozens of restaurants & up market shops all around. It does however also have some drawbacks. The lobby is a bit like an luxury train station with literally hundreds of people constantly milling around. Check in can also be a bit of nightmare if you arrive at the wrong time as everything is 'traffic flowed' so checking in after midday is OK but don't even try before. Everything is very 'regimented' which I guess it has to be with so many rooms & guests but don't stay here if you like small,…",4,9/5/2021
It's grate little bit of a rip off 2 drinks for £5.67 each! To get to the top you have to GO THROUGH 4 sets of lifts and they only go up or down if your put your keycard it a slot but good statues with a epic sky line pool and good view good accommodation HIGLEY RECOMMEND,5,9/6/2021
"I stayed at MBS clubroom with city view on 36th floor with my 7 yo son.  The room was great in everything, the view, the size.  Bathroom has bathtub with separate shower and toilet area.  I got the room right behind the LV shop which is the great spot for the light show.  Everything in the room was great, except the sofa bed was quite old and should be replaced.  We got to use the club lounge for the afternoon tea, the area is quite small.  For breakfast, we didn't have so much time, so we just had breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby area.   The dedicated club front for checking in and out was so slow. And it should have been better in terms of services render to the club customers.    The lobby was too crowded.  There should be an area separately where you can check-in and…",3,9/7/2021
"We picked this hotel as it is in the book ""1001 places to see before you die"". It is amazing. The rooftop pool really is incredible. The gardens next door are also amazing. We have a corner room on the 34th floor with spectacular views of the garden. As a corner room it is much bigger than the normal rooms but costs the same. My one advise to the management is that the check in is not so and there are a lot of people walking through the hotel on the ground floor site seeing. Once you check in though, get to your room, drip your bags and head up to roof pool. The hotel is superb, Just what you expect. ",5,9/8/2021
"Ok, yes it is extremely expensive to stay here, but you get what you pay for. Service throughout the hotel second to none. Infinity pool absolutely superb, poolside service brilliant, cocktails excellent and fries with Parmesan and truffle oil you just must try. Rooms brilliant with spectacular views and quality fixtures and fittings. For me,one of the best hotels ever........",5,9/9/2021
"I stayed here for four nights as part of a conference package.  It is a great hotel, but you do feel at times that its size means that you are just a cog in the machine.   The rooms are really well appointed and not too small.  The bed was comfortable and everything worked well. Of course it was all spotlessly clean. I loved my little balcony and enjoyed watching the storms come in across the bay.   The fridge was one of those sort that monitors what you take out. However, the housekeeping staff were willing to empty out the top layer of my fridge of all of the drinks and food so that I could put my own stuff in.  I was very pleasantly surprised that they had several USB charge points and international power sockets. I could have saved time not digging out my adaptors at home…",4,9/10/2021
"it's all about the skypool! Visited in November this year with two friends and the service for a very busy hotel was commendable. On check in, we arrived late in the evening and therefore there was not a long line. WE were offered a high floor (which is highly recommended) and because there were 3 people in the room, they brought an extra bed and amenities within minutes! Great complex with a large variety of shopping. The skypool is what everyone raves about. Thinking that there were so many guests we were very pleased to see that the pool was not crowded at all! Breathtaking views from the sky pool however the pool side drinks service is quite slow.  Definately recommend it as the place to stay in singapore even for one night! The pool makes it worthwhile.",5,9/11/2021
"It's expensive, but you get what you paid for. The hotel is huge and very crowded. But it's impressive; it's majestic; it feels and looks like a 5 star hotel. Our rooms were very large and nicely decorated. The bathroom was huge, nicely decorated and the bath products were very nice.  The pool at the top of the building is just as nice as the pictures make it. However, it's always crowded, morning and night. That's probably to be expected; and there are a lot of obnoxious kids to. Oh well.  It was a good stay. We stayed in tower three. There were a series of power outages in tower two while we were there. It was funny to watch the staff react to the power outages. They took it very seriously. We walked by the tower two elevator, where a crowd had developed, we kept walking and…",5,9/12/2021
This structure and operation works like a huge cruise ship. It's efficient and flashy but the service lacks an individual touch. Check-in line was long and it was challenging to hear what the receptionist was telling us because of the background noise so we asked politely if she could speak a bit louder but strangely enough she couldn't. Got the room an hour before the official check-in time and a late check-out for 12pm.  The premier room with a city view was spacious and tastefully furnished. Loved the huge bathroom with plenty of towels for once! The beds were large in size and very comfortable.  The skypool and the whole skypark were really nice and less busy than we expected. The views both to the city and the ocean were fantastic.  There were great restaurants and shopping…,4,9/13/2021
"My family and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 4 nights before going on a cruise.  Can't complain about the helpfulness or cleanliness of this hotel at all.  It was everything we imagined after doing our research on-line.  Would happily stay there again but only for a couple of nights as it is very expensive.  But if you want something to cross off your ""bucket list"", the infinity pool is amazing and the sunsets over the high-rises in the afternoon is something really special.    The only negative I have is that they do not include breakfast in your nightly rate and if they do, it is an additional $40.00 per person which is just ridiculous, especially when you have kids and they are flat out eating a piece of toast on the best of days!!!!!",5,9/14/2021
"5 Star is deserved, all, with the exception of not all the facilities of making a cup of tea (coffee yes) in our suite, this was our only very minor itch that we failed to scratch despite informing the staff. Other than this hiccup, it's a fantastic hotel and treat yourself to first class luxury once in your life as far as you are able to do so, you'll not be disappointed. Restaurants exquisite and not too expensive, Singapore itself is great, especially as we used it as a stop over towards Australia. I hope this proves useful to those interested.",5,9/15/2021
The hotel is spacious...big room and high tech fridge plus jacuzzi...I like everything. But the queue during check in and check out was far too long...we waited for 1-2 hours just to check in and out...a shame on such a grand hotel. Management should look into this.,3,9/16/2021
"We stayed in the hotel for a short getaway. The room looks great, the view from the room is also great and we enjoyed the bathtub dips and the spacious room. However towards midnight suddenly water starts raining down from one of the light sockets near the AC. We called the front desk and to our surprise it took 30 minutes for a technician to come. Furthermore it was after our second call to ""expedite"" the technician. After speaking with the technician about the issue we decided to ask the technician to call the front desk to request a new room. And again it took them 30 minutes to get a room. It was out of our expectation because as a guest we were hoping for a swift response noting it was now after midnight. We managed to get a new room around 3am. Slightly smaller but with…",3,9/17/2021
"The check-in process was horrible. We were asked to reply an SMS on our room requirements and check-in time the day before. When we reached the registration counter, we were again asked the same question while queuing. Then asked the same question when checking in. And asked the same question when we collected the key card to our room. I had earlier requested for extra bed for my child and informed via email that it was complimentary. I was told that the request would be tagged to my registration but to no avail. I was also told to pay $100+ for the extra bed when I collected the key card. By then, I was super angry after all the queuing and answering the same question. Giving us juice helped but the reception staff were treating us like cattle with ""take it or leave"" attitude. …",3,9/18/2021
the stay at the hotel itself has been very pleasant as it is a fantastic hotel however the pool experience has been terrible. We couldnt believe how basically the pool area is treated like an aquapark for family with screaming kids spending their entire day there! We dont know if that is the aim of the hotel but clealry having kids screaming and jumping up and down in the main infinity pool wasnt really the experience we were expecting especially after seeing the hotel website and premises. so just be aware!,3,9/19/2021
"This is an absolutely amazing structure and worth the visit. The pool on the top floor is amazing and most of the staff are genuinely friendly. The room is not as great, a tad small and needs some upgrades, however no major issues as its high in confort. Once visit here for a couple of nights is enough to get a good look and feel. Shopping centre across the road is great..",5,9/20/2021
Beautiful building with bay front and swimming pool on the top from where you can see whole Singapore city while swimming. Amazing shops and restaurants inside. Amazing water show on weekends on top. Rooms with the beautiful view.,5,9/21/2021

Incredible property and a must for any Asian travel bucket list! I look forward to my next visit!!!",5,9/22/2021
"The hotel looks simply stunning as you arrive, the large lobby area is beautiful and the hotel staff very nice and complimentary.  The rooms were also very nice, although our air conditioner could have worked more efficiently.  The breakfast area in the lobby served a good international selection.  What drew us to the hotel was a chance to swim in the infinity pool on top of the hotel.  The views at night are breathtaking.  It is a great place to simply relax, have a cocktail and soak in the skyline of Singapore.  The location of the hotel is very convenient to get into the city as well.  Our preferred method was the water taxi - fun to ride and also informative as it provides information, over a speaker, as you travel into the city.

"I've stayed at this hotel several times here in Singapore. The hotel is connected to a mall and casino next door. The rooftop pool provides an amazing view of the city. It's also right next to the subway train, so it is very easy to get around the city. There is a grocery store and food court at the mall next door with food from around the world, in addition to celebrity chef restaurants. So food is not an issue.   The rooms themselves are well appointed. It's worth the extra money for the view with a balcony.   Some of the drawbacks:   It's a very popular hotel so expect tons of crowds in the lobby and at check in and check out.   Secondly, the hotel is very large, so prepare to do a lot of walking.   The rooms on the lower floors are off the lobby atrium, so noise can be an…",5,9/24/2021
"This hotel is unique in that the roof top is modeled after a boat. I paid for an executive room to include breakfast and evening cocktails. I found that to be very good value for money since you can eat and drink enough to fill you up for dinner! The hotel is very commercial and you are on your own from the minute you walk in. I should have been welcomed into the VIP check in service but that was no better than the regular desk. Once you get past that chaos, the hotel is lovely. Going to the roof top is quite the experience and you are walking distance to the Gardens ByThe Bay. If you get to the roof and get to the bow of the 'boat' it actually sways in the breeze!",4,9/25/2021
"Visually the hotel is quite stunning, it looks almost surreal as you see it from a distance and close up it is even more so.The  huge foyer, whilst extraordinary in many ways has the atmosphere of an  airport who large numbers of people milling around pulling hand luggage. Check in was quick and easy and the room facing the beautiful new botanical gardens was perfect in its presentation and layout. Although we were on the 10th floor I have to point out that the traffic noise was bad, ear plugs to assist sleep, bad. Also the AC fan was far too noisy and you could not leave it on overnight. I am not quite sure why or at what point a committee  of hoteliers was set up which came  to the unanimous decision to make a real effort to irritate guests by providing TV remotes that take 3…",4,9/26/2021

The bed is very comfortable and the pillows are soft that we really had a restful sleep. The wifi is faster than average. The food at the sky lounge bar tastes really good too. However, I cannot say the same thing as regards the food selection at the lunch buffet in Rise which is quite frustrating although the wait staff service is great. Perhaps the Executive Chef should also consider serving pork dishes. There's also a subway station which makes travelling around the city state so convenient.

We were on the 47 th floor in Tower 1, and it was easy to go to the gym and the infinity pool.  We stayed mostly at the hotel as there are many things to do, shopping next door, and a park nearby. We even walked to the Merlion and then on to Orchard Road, did about 10 km that day! Oh, we also received a gift of chocolate strawberries as it was our sweet sixteen wedding anniversary... thank you so much MBS.",5,9/28/2021

After check in we tried to get to our room on 46th floor,initially we took the wrong lift,as did many others. Room was great view spectacular,we were looking directly at The Fullerton that I was beginning to think I should have booked. We decided to go to the ""Club"" We had booked a club room,for afternoon Tea. We had to take a lift up to another level go through security by producing our room key,we had one between two,at this point I wondered if we were in a Hotel or airport security.

Paid over 500 SGD for their Premier City Room with internet. Was looking forward to it...  On day of arrival and during check-in, was told that I was upgraded to their club room. Very excited and thankful about it. Upon getting into the room on the 35th level, I was utterly disappointed. Other than a big room, there was totally lack of character or class in design and furniture. The room is pure plain, furniture looks pitiful in such a large room.

"Massive hotel that is very well run.  Received helpful communication through SMS which allowed me to check-in and then let the hotel that I was about to arrive. I could then join the express line, which saved a lot of time checking-in. I had an ocean side room which had a balcony. There is no outside furniture, so we carried the room furniture out. The room was large, with an excellent huge bath. My colleagues had a city side room - the view is great, but the room is smaller and has no balcony. The pool is fantastic. I love the fact that they have an ""Adults Only"" section in the pool, which is strictly controlled by the lifeguards. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. I checked out using SMS and so avoided more lines. Overall a great experience.",4,10/4/2021

The room was divine and given the chance we wouldn't  have left the hotel to go around to see the city. But the real icing in the cake was the butler services. This guys went above and beyond to make our stay special and memorable.  We were blown away by their effort to give us a special  turn in when they  discovered that we were newly weds. My wife really loved the scattered rose petal and the complementary wine and chocolates as well as the cute marina bay teddy bears. The service and efforts was really appreciated.

Check in staff are really helpful and nice as well which is important for a hotel with guests arriving/departing at all hours of the night. The buffet breakfast was nice, but if it wasn’t included in our room rate we wouldn’t have gone there as it is expensive for what it is. The pool and bar upstairs are incredible – the Pepper Pots cocktail is delicious!",5,10/7/2021
I stayed for a night on the 16th with family. It is a nice place with great views and loads of selfie opportunity. The kids had a great time at the infinity pool. Had a tough time getting them out :). The staff were generally friendly and the checkin/checkout process is quick. Special thanks to Miss Manjula (spelling!) at the gym/spa entrance who was extremely helpful in explaining the facility to my family members who were there for the first time. Great job MBS.,4,10/8/2021
"If travelling to Singapore you must stay here at least one night. Yes it's big, it's busy, it's over the top, but well worth the stay just for the view and the pool. Save money by buying your alcohol from the 7 eleven at the train station below the hotel.",5,10/9/2021
"Actually I found all Singapore expensive for what it is the value is definitely not fair. About MBS - so many people around, the luxury about it is just lost as if it were a market sale. But it is far from being a sale there. At the pool you will have to search well to get a sunbed, enormous amount of people around you, like in an aquapark should say.  Having taken few foots and seen the sunset for once, will definitely not go back.  The rooms are huge, comfortable and well equipped. The only advantage",3,10/10/2021

"It was a nice room but honestly it seems we are paying for the rooftop infinity pool rather for room. I felt the rate for the rooms at MBS are overpriced in that sense as I would expect better amenities in the room.   Room Check in time 3pm / check out time 11am Booked the premier room, twin beds which are two single beds (small double beds) Which is ok for family with 2 small kids. Stayed on the 8th floor which was a bit troublesome as you have to change lift on the 22nd floor to the rooftop infinity pool. Hence try to get higher floor rooms (22nd and above) if possible. Room was spacious but felt the balcony was a waste of a space.  There were extra pillow in cupboard so total of 5 pillows for the 4 of us.   TWG teabags were provided complimentary.

"Not a good start to our experience at Marina Bay Sands. We were checked-in half an hour late. It's weird, because they have a later check-in and earlier check-out than other hotels. Not sure what's so special about this hotel.   Oh yes, I do remember now. It's the infinity pool!!   Okay, that's about it. The price I paid was for the pool, which is crowded anyway. Excellent view nonetheless.   I'm surprised that there are repeat visitors to this property. There are other hotels that you can go to in Singapore, which offer a much better experience than Marina Bay Sands.  The only good experience I had here was the pool. Yup, I kept mentioning the pool because there's nothing else to compliment on!",2,10/14/2021
You come here so you can take a sweet photo from the infinity pool looking over the city. Guaranteed 100 likes. It's as amazing as it looks. The rooms are so comfy & the bed is like sleeping on a cloud of candy floss. If you're into selfies they offer selfie sticks. It's expensive but you're in the coolest looking building in Singapore.,5,10/15/2021
My overnight stay with aunt and uncle at Marina Bay Sands was unforgettable. The experience is superb! The staffs were very friendly and accomodating. Really a world-class and excellent hotel and service by MBS.,5,10/16/2021
"An excellent hotel to stay at. I booked a room here for my birthday, quite pricey but was definitely worth the $! From food, sight seeing, shopping to nature walks, very efficient transport...you can't go wrong sigh the Marina Bay Sands. I've had 3 business conferences here as well, fantastic service from staff, good food service, conference equipment  and venue.",5,10/17/2021
"The biggest disappointment. Huge building, no courtesy. Bellmen are unfriendly and no personalized service at all.  Of course, the view from the pool is fantastic! But it is not a reason to stay at this hotel. Ku De Ta is overpriced and again too crowded.",2,10/18/2021
"the pool!  one comes for the pool. the pool and only the pool. this includes of course: the view from the pool - the photo op's in the pool - drinks served poolside - probably the best view and distant enough to singapore - the  club poolside for brkfst, at best when SIN goes 'through carwash' and can't be seen at all due to heavy rain.  so don't go wasting 20 S$ on the sky observation desk or the ""ku de ta"" for drinks. both won't get u on the 'right' side up there.  you can  easily afford one of the wonderfully  addressed rooms by avoiding the nosense boring shopping, casino and show areas and enjoy the top of the tops instead.  sounds like i don't call this one of my fav cities - correct. but if one has to be here for work one might make the best out of it - at least for the…",5,10/19/2021
Please take the city view rooms and in the premium tower so can enjoy the laser show at 8 pm at its best . and sky park what a way to take a swim and enjoy the scene . its a fabulous resort with unlimited dining an shopping facility plus casino plus huge rooms ,5,10/20/2021
"(we're rewriting this review on a new family tripadvisor account, so please do pardon us! this review was from may, 2012.)  after reading some negative reviews on tripadvisor, we went for our staycation at mbs with lower expectations. but we were in for a pleasant surprise.  check in was a breeze, and we were given a much higher floor, the 46th floor. we booked the premier room (as the deluxe room did not come with a bathtub), and the room was very spacious with a balcony and a spectacular view. the bed was really comfortable too. they even had a qiblat arrow in one of the drawers, which we thought was a really nice gesture by the hotel for their muslim guests. one thing we learnt by mistake though, the fridge had sensors. we opened the fridge and a can of drink fell out, and it…",5,10/21/2021
"Marina Bay Sands it's an excellent hotel to stay when in Singapore. Te service is excellent.  We arrive early in the morning from our last day at a Celebrity Cruise, and the did not have available rooms, but take us to the VIP registration desk just because there were like 6 people in line in fron of us; that make you feel taken care of. They took care of our luggage and gave us key to access the rooftop pool and restaurants.   The rooms are gorgeous with very large bathrooms, incredible showers, a bathtub to enjoy a relaxing bath, and very nice amenities in the double sink area. They have a set of very comfortable sofas and chairs. It also has a desk if you want to work for a minute or two, because with the view you have, it’s difficult to concentrate. The infinite pool at the…",5,10/22/2021
We  were attracted by the panoramic pool like many others do. The pool was so congested even during weekday and almost couldn't find a place to sit down. The room is acceptably spacious and the breakfast is quite good. The best service was their valet parking service which is free of charge for hotel guest and very convenient.,4,10/23/2021
"As expats living in Singapore, a night at MBS has been on our to-do list since we landed on this island.  We are leaving soon, so we splurged and booked a room for our three teenagers as a Christmas gift.  We realized that we would most likely get 3 room keys, and only the kids would have access to the rooftop pool.  My husband and I would be disappointed, but it was for the kids.  We would survive, right?  Anyhow, I booked through Agoda, and when we arrived to check in, MBS weren't aware that we had reservations.  This was not their fault, it was a communication issue with Agoda.  But because our check-in took longer than normal, we were given five keys as a gift.  I nearly jumped for joy, I was so thrilled.  The gal at the front desk got a real kick out of my excitement, and…",4,10/24/2021

MBS's staffs are nice, friendly and so helpful, fast response/assistance to the special request or queries.. it's an excellent services for customer satisfaction ..  Beautiful view in every way.. Simply minimalis Suite's interior design and large room is so comfortable and convenience for family trip.. High rated for the cleanliness and high quality for security aspect.. One stop living concept is so spectacular .. With MBS, you don't need to go somewhere else..  Very recommended for whether short or long stay, spend all day at Marina Bay area..  ",5,10/25/2021
"I'm actually staying in Singapore and One of my dreams is to stay even just for a night in this awesome hotel. And I did before the year ends. We got the room at a very good rate, so we grabbed the deal. The hotel have 3 towers, we were booked at tower 2. It is nearby the Singapore Art museum, Casino and The shoppes if you want to go opt for shopping. Coffee stands, resto and 7/11 are just nearby. A walking distance to helix bridge and The Merlion. The best part is the infinity pool located at the skypark. It is an awesome view especially in the dawn where you will see the Singapore skylines.",5,10/26/2021
"If you want excellent service and luxury, then book a suite in this hotel  Fron the personal  meet and greet in the lobby, in room check in to the one touch priority telephone service for all your needs, everything is taken care of.  Access to the Club on the Skypark for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails left us requiring nothing else in the way of dining  Concierge servivevto confirm  airport transfers and flights coupled with video check out made the whole stay effortless  underground access to the mall and MRT was brilliant and the innroom service second to none.  This must be the only place to stay in Singapore.   They confirmed flights and airline transfers prior to departure and In room check out",5,10/27/2021
"Pros  - strategic location.  The BEST if u are visiting gardens by the bay, shopping,  etc etc around marina bay area - view is breathtaking and so is the panaromic view from the invite pool. It really is when you see it for the first time.   Cons - you only have two pros above - service is really not up to par for a 5 star hotel. There is no one to help you at the lobby. Only at the reception  and counters. I had to wade through tourists and crane my neck to find a staff. The security at skypark acted like ""bouncers"" in a club. We were rudely directed to the guest lift when we unknowingly got in queue at the skypark access lift.  They also sent an sms prior to checkin to ask about the size of bed. Smart because it was SUPPOSED to expedite the check in time. However, when I was…",2,10/28/2021
"I received a text message from Marina Bay Sands (MBS) one day before my arrival date, requesting me to reply with my preferred check-in time and choice of bed size. On the day of check in, I received another message with a mobile phone number provided, requesting me to call MBS 5 minutes before my arrival. I did. When I arrived at the registration counter, I made known to the executive on duty manning the queue that I have responded to the text messages and I was quickly ushered to a readily available counter, skipping the long queue and my check in was done within 3 minutes!  Going to the room was easy. Directional signs were everywhere. I identified the tower and floor number and went straight to my room.   The premium room was spacious and very clean. Washroom has two basins,…",4,10/29/2021
Amazing stay here at the Marina Bay Sands! A lot of hotels say the have the 'WOW' factor but this one definitely does. Stayed in a 45th floor suite in Tower 2 with city views and it was amazing. Floor to ceiling window overlooks the city skyline which is awe inspiring at either day or night. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom facilities were excellent with a stand alone bathtub and a walk in shower. The money you pay for the hotel is worth it alone for the rooftop infinity pool which is truly something you should HAVE to do when in Singapore. It is only for hotel guests so that is quite nice with food and drink service whilst you are lounging on top of Singapore. Ate at Ku De Ta that evening on top of the Skypark with views overlooking the city skyline for our anniversary…,5,10/30/2021
"Had a fantastic stay at MBS, the hotel i huge! So Make sure you know what tower you are staying in before you get in a taxi.  The reception staff were very kind and service minded, especially Vanessa! The rooms are very clean and if you can make sure you get a City View. The view of Singapore is spectacular!  A must is the Infinity pool on the top floor! There's plenty of space and there's even an area for adults only which is good if you're travelling without children or if you just want som peace and quiet!  Easy to get around as well, there is a MRT just around the corner otherwise there are taxis outside the hotel 24/7!",5,10/31/2021
"Everyone claims that you must not miss Marina Bay Sands if u visited Singapore.  I think for shopping and for dining places, they are fine.  But for the hotel itself, the staff and services really turned you off.  They are rude and helpless and they don't even know what is basic services at all.  I wonder if they have undergone any of the trainings at all.  We stayed in Mandarin and Fairmont in Singapore before and they are both cheaper than Marina but their services are lots better than Marina Bay Sands.  I really hope that they can review their staff performance as I believe visitors are just too tired to keep complaining.",2,11/1/2021
"I had some expectations, given the pricey tag of $500+/night which was not inclusive of breakfast.    The stay started out on a wrong foot almost immediately as one of the magnetic cards failed.  I eventually got into the room using the other card so I didn't make a big fuss.  The room is longish and not quite spacious. To my dismay, however, the balcony was empty. I mean, like no chairs, no table, no nothing empty. Desolate. The flooring was CONCRETE and dusty.  What a waste of real estate in a country with very little of that to go around! Whatever it was, I think the hotel was not encouraging us to go out on the balcony at all. The bathroom had no bathtub.  Not cool.  Not cool at all.   Usually, people would rave over the pool.  I suppose I probably would have done the same…",3,11/2/2021
"The room, staff and hotel are very good. Disappointing breakfast, lots of choice but hot western selection was mostly cold, who likes cold sausages and bacon for breakfast? I also asked for poached eggs and was told selection is boiled, fried or an omelette made to order.  For the price they charge I would have thought that poached eggs might be an option!! I will try elsewhere on my next visit.",4,11/3/2021
"We stayed in a suite that came with club privileges. The club was great - a small oasis of calm, on an otherwise very busy 57th floor. Even at 8am the jacuzzi were all full and the pool area was so busy. It is an amazing property and we will definitely stay again.",5,11/4/2021
"My fiancé and I stayed at MBS for one night during our recent holiday and we loved everything about it! Our corner room was magnificent - spacious and luxurious. The bed was soooo comfortable, and the bathroom and amenities were wonderful. We had also had access to The Club which I highly recommend both for breakfast (OMG) and pre-dinner drinks. The pool is obviously amazing, as is the access to the casino and shopping downstairs. The perfect place to stay in Singapore!",5,11/5/2021
"For the architectural intrigue that it was, it was disappointing that the interior design of this hotel is pretty ordinary. There are boutique hotels in Singapore that cost far less with more interesting designs. The lobby was noisy and full of tourist. The skybar was also crowded. Will not return, not worth the money.",2,11/6/2021
"Excellent service from the moment u step into the hotel. Staff was very helpful guiding us towards which tower to check in, mind you they have 3 towers. Fast check in and check out,  even with a long line of guest.  5 star pool with 5 star pool service, Pool attendance were very attentive to guest needs. Room was excellent. Near MRT station. If I have to say one negative comment, it would be the weak pressure of the shower. Definitely a must stay hotel. ",5,11/7/2021
"I have wanted to visit MBS for some time, yes to swim in THAT pool. I was not disappointed, when the elevator doors opened for the first time, I actually gasped! It is just stunning. Yes it is busy, but I agree with other reviews the hotel is not intimate. MBS seems like it has become its own tourist attraction with people everywhere, so you need to be OK with that. That said, foyers and hall on room floors are very quiet and our sleep was not disturbed. Public areas, like the check in foyer and the pool, yes you are dodging crowds! The taxi rank is organised and we never waited too long for a cab. We didn't venture too far from the hotel, and visited Sweet Spot on few occasions which was good. The hotel room itself was very large, comfortable, clean and we had a room on the…",5,11/8/2021
"This was my 2nd time staying at MBS on transit to London. We were booked into the Orchid Suites for 2 nights. I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email from their Guest Service Executives 2 weeks prior to our arrival welcoming us to their property. I didn't get this email on my first visit over a year ago staying at the Club Room, hence the surprise.   Checking in was a bit disappointed as they had changed the location to be at the corner of the large reception area. It used to be in a separate room. Majority of the 5 star hotels around the world have their club/suites guests checking-in in their executive lounges.   The Orchid Suite was spacious. We had booked the City View suite and was surprised that the bathroom has views over the gardens (Gardens by the Bay). Only have…",4,11/9/2021
"I think Marina Bay Sands management severely lacks experience in Hospitality Business. I had a plan to book a room for one night in the iconic hotel of Singapore after my presentation in Sands Expo and Convention Centre (the hotel's meeting centre). However, after visiting Sands Expo and Convention Centre, I could not convince myself to book a room in their hotel. In brief, the toilet was dirty, the floor marble lost its shininess due to lack of proper maintenance, servers were wondering around clueless during the drinks and nibbles, carpet was dirty, wooden deck was grayed out due to lack of maintenance. In my life, I never saw a five star hotel in such a poor condition.",1,11/10/2021
"Since MBS hotel opened a few years ago, many have raved about this hotel. Mostly about its casino and the famous infinity pool. The service was good though not fantastic. The 2 magnetic access cards were so intermittent. Out of every 10 tries, at least 7 cant open the door. I feedback this to the reception and all they offered was that I have to slide out s.l.o.w.l.y. I was thinking at that time....I stayed in many hotels and I have only encountered such access systems that must be activated s.l.o.w.l.y. Anyway, I tried to go as slow as possible and most of the time, it did not work. I would expect someone would come to the room and check.   The room was good with a full length window. I liked the big bathtub the best. One weird design was that the bathroom door is a sliding…",4,11/11/2021
"Between feeling like I was on a mountain top in Singapore on the South China Sea with container ships as far as the eye could see, to enjoying hours upon hours at the pool on the sky deck I had a wonderful 24 hours here. I left the hotel only to eat at the food court in the nearby shops, a jogging loop in the nearby Gardens By The Bay, and a visit to the casino on the ground level.    A friend asked me if it was worth all of the hype, and I said absolutely. I had fun just taking pictures, people watching and swimming in the infinity edge pool with the surreal views of the Singapore City Center, Marina Bay and the open ocean.   Views should be seen at sunrise to late into the evening when the laser light shows are cranking.  Treat yourselves and someone special to witness this…",5,11/12/2021
"I have been to this hotel quite few times and it is one of the best hotel that I have ever been to.  Comparing to the hotels in Europe, it is far better and cheaper.  The sky-park at the top of the hotel is just awesome.  In addition, the swimming pool and pool side bar makes it even better.  You also get to enjoy a lovely skyline view of the city drinking some fine cocktail with your partner or a ocean view which is not as good as city; sitting inside a jacuzzi.  On a plus point, its location is much more better when it comes to shopping, casino, restaurants and visit as there are some amazing places and museums nearby.",5,11/13/2021
"We stayed at this hotel in November, '14. We were in Singapore for two days and spent a night there. This is absolutely a must hotel to stay at. At $400 a night it is pretty expensive but if you are visiting Singapore you must spend at least one night there. The access to infinity pool alone is worth the price of the reservation! The world's largest rooftop pool is spanning across three hotel towers and opens a spectacular view on Singapore Skyline. My only regret is that we didn't splurge more and didn't book a Club Room that would also provide an access to the lounge by the pool area. There are also two jacuzzi style hot tubs across from the pool that came quite helpful as the weather during our first day was rather chilly and rainy. You can also access complimentary sauna…",5,11/14/2021
"3 night stay on a high floor.  Pro's: Skypool Large room Close to MRT and Gardens by the Bay The bald guy who stands inside MBS near Tower 1 is so helpful with everything, especially thorough directions.  Con's: Everything is expensive. It's $60 to buy your photo from the photographer in the skypool. Upon check out, somehow there were items missing from the mini bar. For the money you pay to stay here, I have stayed at nice places where the staff follow you around with towels by the pools and wait on your hand and foot, for less. The staff just aren't that interested considering how much money you are pumping out.",4,11/15/2021
I know about Singapore and its hotels. Singapore is also famous for variety and quality food. My desire to visit Singapore and to stay in its best hotel ie Marina bay sands. Moshey Shafdey is the architect of this hotel and this hotel belongs to world famous Vegas Sands group. First of all the greatness in its modern architecture. It is adding more value to the Singapore this hotel is like paradise for all types of people. It is setting standards for the hotel industry. All continents foods are available and service is too good. If money is not matter for you this hotel is the best in Singapore and adds more value.,4,11/16/2021
"Loved this hotel and the staff were amazing. Upon arrival we were immediately redirected to the VIP registration desk as we had a 7 month old baby so they wanted our check in to be a priority. We arrived at 12.30pm and our room was all ready for us, which was great. We were able to wind down and relax after our flight. The staff at the hotel and restaurant Rise were all very friendly and attentive. Loved the location, MRT station is right beneath the hotel so getting everywhere was simple. We stayed in a Premier City view room and it was huge. Plenty of room for our baby to crawl around. Would definitely recommend people to stay here especially if you have young children as there are restaurants and shops right within the complex. It is quite expensive but the view and the pool…",5,11/17/2021
"Most folks go up to the top (a cement cruise ship!) of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. If you are not a guest, the fee is $20 USD. When you arrive at the top the views are amazing....and there are photo ops at every turn however, on a hot day there is no where to sit. Even with a snack bar atop for drinks and hot dogs, there is NO place to sit. I feel like I was being rushed to leave.",5,11/18/2021

Marina Bay Sands recently hosted one of the major travel events of the Asian market and much to my expectations, it was an awesome stay. starting from the welcome, the impeccable customer service, the view, the bespoke architecture, Marina Bay Sands is absolutely brilliant! The review would remain incomplete without the mention of the culinary segment, which is, needless to say compliment the hotel exceptionally well. Did I mention the swimming pool? Another awesome feature of Marina Bay Sands making it completely different from the rest of the international convention centers I have visited. undoubtedly, I would love to visit Marina Bay Sands again and again!",5,11/23/2021
"This is my second stay at the Marina Bay Sands. I had a seafacing room on the 41st floor with spectacular views of the gardens by the bay and the sea. The room was wonderful in all senses of the word. The gym facilities were good enough. Working out to a view of the financial district is not bad at all. The roof top pool looks great and the pool area is well designed. However, there was no privacy up there. The Infinity pool was crowded at all times with more people taking pictures than actually swimming. The breakfast area is crowded, the lobby area is full of tourists taking pictures of the wonderful architecture. Having breakfast is like stting in a side restaurant in a mall or a busy street.

My partner and I stayed here for 1 night as part of our anniversary celebration. Check in was delayed and the lady who served us wasn't at all friendly. Room was spacious with a gorgeous view.  Breakfast was mediocre. Food was luke warm and my partner didn't enjoy it very much. The infinity pool was over crowded thus we didn't get to enjoy it as much as we would  love to. We would probably give it another shot but hope to expect better service and food next time round.,3,11/27/2021
The best thing to do in Singapore is to visit the roof top of Marina Bay Sands and the Bar at the top Coup De Tat. Access from the city end of the Enormous Lobby where an access pass is available and you can get into the dedicated lift. Better to go around 7pm and catch the light show. Shopping under the Marina Bay Sands is the best and has a tripping food court. ,5,11/28/2021
Where do you start. The view from the pool at the top is just sensational and a popular destination with the expat businessmen/women. Restaurant is very nice but really there is so much nice dining in Singapore at much lower prices you'd only eat here for a special occassion. Bar is trendy and nice. Go down to the shopping levels and be prepared to be blown away. The food cour is sensational as are the number and variety of shops in the complex and they even have a gondola and canal experience and an ice skating rink in the food court.,4,11/29/2021
"This hotel is massive. Like Las Vegas massive. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you certainly feel like just another credit card walking through the door. We booked this hotel, so we could use the pool. Let's face it, thats the main draw for most people I think. First up the rooms are quite nicely appointed, but in the end they are pretty standard high end hotel rooms. As for the pool, it is quite crowded, which I think really detracts from the overall experience. If you want some solitude at the pool, I went up every morning at opening, when there were spectacular sunrises and peace and quiet. After that, it is quite busy, until just before closing when it starts to thin out again.",4,11/30/2021
"Honestly, if you were staying for 2 or 4 or 6 nights at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, you wouldn't really have to leave this place. My brother in law and sister were staying here this past September while we stayed in the Chinatown area. We got to spend the day with them and take a tour since we knew someone that worked there. The rooms are nice and spacious. The hotel itself is overwhelming, huge and grand. The ceilings are very high. The pool area was nice as it's infinity style, but it was a little too crowded for my liking. Also since it's high up there, you have to consider the wind factor as it was a bit cold. The towels and service were nice. There are a lot of restaurants within the compound too that were good. A lot of shopping, a fashion show that took place right in the…",4,12/1/2021

"I had been wanting to stay at MBS ever since i stepped foot in Singapore. Fortunately , we got a good deal for the grand club room which has access to the sky lounge for cocktails and high tea. The room was spacious and luxurious to say the least but what stole the show was the view from the 40th floor. Not to mention, the skypark and the pool are an experience in itself. To relax in the pool while enjoying views of the merlion, floating stadium and CBD is an incredible experience. I recommend everyone to stay here atleast for one night. For tourists, do not plan any sightseeing on the day you pick for MBS. Just stay in and enjoy the pool.",5,12/3/2021
"Ah.. my second visit to The MBS. This time round, in a city-facing room - had a balcony room facing the Garden last time. The room was clean and spacious. It was comfortable, but nothing to wow about other than the spectacular view afterdark.  And then… there's the Infinity Pool. I dare say it is at least half, if not the whole point of many people's stay. Not sure if it was due to the rain and lightning (Ok, probably due to the storm)… but the crowd was a lot more civilised this time around. In fact, it was overall less crowded. The last time, I was surrounded by squawking airheads it's amazing I didn't go deaf...   And there's again the sight of tourists trotting around in hotel in-room bathrobes… My God, what a most-fetching look… I swear it is rivalled only by the loud…",4,12/4/2021
"I love this hotel and have stayed here three or four times.  The views are magnificent, the rooms are lovely and it is pretty amazing to look at.  I note many of the negative reviews comment on service being poor.  Most of these are probably correct though some folks are pretty precious when they fork out between 400-1000 for a room.    This place has 2500+ rooms (!!!!)  so I would suggest that you will only be disappointed if you want highly personalized service.   Breakfast will cost you about SGD48 and a gin and tonic about SGD27 at the bar on the top floor.  So yep, it is pricey.  I love it and will stay here again.",4,12/5/2021

We were so excited to stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel as I had heard a lot about the property.  However, I am considering cancelling the room as I have had a horrible experience to date with this property.  They seem to be so ""popular"" that hospitality has been lost on them.  I told them it was our honeymoon and no form of congrats or welcoming has been offered - in stead they are very business and money focused in their answers.  For instance, our room was booked as a high floor reservation but they advised they would note our request.

Getting to orchard road for some shopping is about 20 minutes from here! The check-in counter staff were very polite :) Major plus!  The rooms feature an amazing view of Gardens by the Bay or Singapore's central district which is calming and noise-free.

"I went to the Marina Bay Sands on 29th Nov. I checked that the building design was excellent. In the Casino, the atmosphere was easy going in the Casino. In the hotel lobby, the stmosphere was brand new. There were two big restaurants. They are serving buffets at noon.",5,12/8/2021
"I attended a dinner at the Peony Junior Suite on 4th Floor of Marina Bay Sands Convention Center  As a first time visit to Marina Bay Sands,  this was a disappointment:  1. Food was pre cooked and were cold when served The worst dish being steam fish which is entirely overcooked  2. Service was poor.  The waiters were all part time and inexperienced  3. The parking facilities were totally unfriendly.  I took 2 hours between getting into the car park and locating a parking lot  I will not recommend Marina Bay Sands to anyone planning an event",1,12/9/2021
"We had a staycation at MBS in November. We booked a Club Room but was upgraded to the Orchid Suite. It was a huge 97 sq metres rm with a queen size bed n 2 pull out queen size sofa bed. The floor to ceiling windows provided us with a bird's eye view of the city skyline.  We enjoyed free delicious breakfast n afternoon tea at the highest floor of the hotel. Quite a nice spread of food.  The facilities are definitely 5 star but not for the service at the reception. Simple queries on parking were not answered and the reception staff simply told us that she didn't know. I dont think this is an acceptable standard for a 5 star hotel - that a front line staff cannot even answer a simple query on parking and didn't even offered to help us find the solution to our query. On the whole, I…",5,12/10/2021
"Incredible hotel, beautiful rooms which are immaculate, amazing staff, jaw dropping views from 57th floor with the most amazing infinity pool.  I could moan that there were no free sun beds around the incredible pool but I'm not surprised.  So great to have an adults only section although some people clearly couldn't read the signs.  This was an item on my bucket list and it was totally amazing!",5,12/11/2021
"Though MBS is one of the landmarks of Singapore, it simply fails to deliver the quality that a true first-class 5* hotel should.   The sheer size of crowd that they are dealing with, makes it a not so attractive proposition in our eyes. Infiniti pool is only a photo-op that would pull you back by ~$350 per night. Service was pretty much non-existent and we did not feel for once that we are staying at a Landmark Hotel in one of the best cities in the world.   Furniture & fittings too were pretty okay when you compare it to the likes of Movenepick Heritage, etc.  All in all not something that I would recommend unless you want the Infiniti Pool photo-op",3,12/12/2021
Room very cozy...huge bathroom. pillows and bed are comfortable. Pool area crowded but relaxing. Check in and check out was express as before we arrive we sms our details of time of arrival desired room (king or 2 double bed). Checking out also express as you only need to fill out form and drop your key card on the box. Only not good comment from me was no free breakfast even only set meal. with the price of the room customer paying they deserve to provide free breakfast.As overall we are happy and definitely go back again.,4,12/13/2021
Stayed for one night on 49th floor. The view is stunning.. the rooftop got sky dining and pool and bar. Tried tonkotsu ramen but tasted poor.. they should learn from ikkudo/ikousha for better ramen. Haha..  Bar free for everyone to enter but i think need to buy drink.. i didn't try..  The room is clean. There are complimentary fruits and chocolate for us but unfortunately the kiwi is not edible yet..   The bathtub is nice.. but too bad don't have bubble bath amenities.. i expect more from this kind of hotel. The shower is too slippery for me.. so have to use rubber carpet provided. The toilet overall is spacious.  The aircon is perfect. Bed and pillow are nice. There is light show at 8 pm.  The hotel is so crowded even using vip membership also need to wait until 3.30 pm to…,4,12/14/2021
"Booked the Orchid Suite city views along with our travelling companions 12 months ago expecting a relaxing end to 2 weeks of up market cruising down the coast  of Vietnam from Hong Kong. Got to the MBS and while the wives were booking in via the VIP Check in counter I overheard my wife start to become worried about the room booking, I overheard my friends wife trying to settle mine after the hotel staff indicated we would all be in the one suite. She indicated the suite was an upgrade! My wife immediately fell quiet. The Premium Services Manager asked the four of us to accompany him to the suite via an elevator not generally used by the hotel guests. We arrived on the 50th floor and the entry to our suite. The Manager opened the doors, we walked in and nearly feinted. We had…",5,12/15/2021
Stayed for four nights in the lap of luxury after a gruelling trip to Vietnam/Cambodia. Upgraded to a suite with access to the Club with complimentary breakfast afternoon tea and drinks and canapés. It was a welcome luxury and unbelievable experience. Very impressive. The views are awesome. Like nothing else in the world.,5,12/16/2021
"Hotels are not of huge interest to me. When travelling I tend to use them for sleep and not a lot else and it is rare that one will constitute a highlight of my trip. For the Marina Bay Sands I make an exception.  It is a hotel I have always wanted to visit and it did not disappoint. The lobby is stunning, a huge space with courteous and professional staff. Check in was a breeze.  We were upgraded complimentarily and enjoyed a beautiful room with fantastic city views. It goes without saying that the room was spotless, quiet, and comfortable. Room service was prompt and not bank-breaking. Environment controls were effortless and produced great results.  Location is pretty good. It sits on top of a metro station, however we used taxi for all of our Singapore trips (convenient,…",5,12/17/2021

"The hotel is indeed very good and had everything I wanted and needed, however I found it to be too complex and not so straight forward as I expected it to be.   Firstly I found it very difficult to get to car park as it is huge. After parking my car, it took me a whole to locate the exit which would lead me to the reception area. While at the reception area, there were just too many people around which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Perhaps it is a personal preference of mine and expectation that a 5 star hotel at this price range should have very personalised check-in procedures. After getting my key card, I had to navigate my way to the room, ensuring I do not miss the correct lift lobby (as there are many lift lobbies leading to different buildings of the hotel).

"Obviously as the landmark of Singapore, marina bay sands will definitely be a tick box for the travel in Singapore. As a residence in Singapore, I celebrate an anniversary with my bf in that hotel and both of us feel one night stay will be enough, more than that will be a waste of money.   In all, it is a hotel you will not feel privacy, intimacy and cozy if you are outside your room. The whole hotel is crowded with tourists and it feels like walking in a shopping mall in the promotional season that you see too many people around you. I feel same every time I walked to the lobby/lounge or whatever you call but I call it a ""shopping mall"" area. The dining area in the lobby, you won't have the peaceful environment to enjoy the food or a chat as you will be watched all the time by…",3,12/21/2021
"Very nice hotel.   Sky pool is a must see.   Rooms are very spacious. Bed is very comfortable. Rooms have several USB ports. For me that is a must.   Overpriced drinks and food.   Views are amazing.   Not a very good hotel for kids. If your going with your family. Sentosa island is the place for you.

"Marina Bay Sands is a landmark in Singapore being one of Singapore's tallest  hotels. We stayed there en route to Australia just to relax by their signature infinity pool on the 55. floor. And it did not let us down! The view was excellent, the pool large enough to accommodate everybody, even with a part set aside as a no kid zone. Be sure to catch the 8 o'clock laser show both from above and below. It is quite spectacular either way. The hotel is integrated with the conference center, casino and a large mall so you need not step out of the building. But one of the next door neighbors is Garden on the Bay which is definitely worth a visit. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the service is impeccable.",5,12/23/2021
"I was so fascinated and thrilled with all those extensive advertisement until before I actually staying at this hotel. It started one day on the beginning of Nov 2014, I received an invitation from MBS for $200++/night offer with deluxe room instead of the normal rate of %400++/night. Without any further hesitation, I booked for 2 nights (then cancelled to 1 night staying only, due to a sudden occurence). As soon as I arrived at the tower 3 check in counter, a japanese lady warmly greed me and guide me to the counter check in. The receptionist is warm eventhough she made a lot of mistakes, for example, she put a 2 nights room deposit instead of 1 night, and she is not proficient enough with the use of signature pad for the payment system. Anyhow, I arrive at the hotel, the…",3,12/24/2021

"Stayed here for 2 nights, and I will defiantly NOT be returning. The hotel, although very spectacular just doesn't have any character. Upon arrival it felt like I was entering a shopping mall come train station rather than a hotel.  The room (in tower two) was large with a town view, but lots of things were very worn and it definitely need a refresh. Access to the rooftop pool was through a building zone and felt very shabby and run down. On top of this I during the reservation have arranged a late checkout and use of the club, but mysteriously this had been forgotten when we came to use them (and after we had paid).  All in all probably one of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had at a hotel in 30years of travelling.... beware of promises made at reservation and…",1,12/26/2021

We were processed like a sardine factory by the front desk. No extra hello whatsoever. I was asked if I would use my credit card to authorise payment or could wait for my husband to arrive the next day. I said we will wait for him. On 6th Dec we ordered room svc - a pizza and fries. They tell me I have to pay cash bec no credit card given. I gave the accounts dept my credit card and $2,400 deducted from my Amex ( verified by AMEX on 6th Dec).

"My wife and I chose to stay here for  1 night after our honey moon cruise. And I will not lie we chose the hotel mainly for the sky park. Also for being in the Marina Bay Area. This hotel is a new icon of Singapore. We had looked at tripadvisor prior to our visit we were a little unsettled by its rank. However when you have 11,000 reviews vs a close second to 1 or 2 thousand. Or the number one having 250 reviews. So giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt we chose to stay. The que for the fd was very crowded. As I'm sure it normally is for the size of the hotel. You may not receive the best service    At this part of the hotel.

"The only good thing about this hotel is the pool. Do not go for any other reason. The check-in process is akin to passing customs (except it takes longer and the staff are not as friendly). The staff treat you like criminals - we are a couple and only one of us had our key cards but the girl at the entrance to the pool wouldn't let us in until we virtually begged her (she huffed and said ""only this once!""). Upon check-out we told the staff that we had a late flight. We were rudely told that we would be unable to use the hotel facilities (including the pool) even though the pool area was nowhere near full. The way she handled our request was also rude and off-hand. I've been to many hotels all over the world and I can categorically say that this service was the worst by an…",1,12/29/2021

Besides that, and as many people have commented here already, the vistas from  the infinity pool is unique and breathtaking, which has a 360 degree panoramic view of the Singapore sky line, from edge to edge literally.

"For many travellers the main reason for staying at the Marina Bay Sands is for the pool and the experience truly is amazing. I arrived at the pool at about 2 PM and it was still relatively quiet. Got a 'front-row' lounger and let myself be swept away by the pool and the view. However, after a while the pool got busier and busier with camera toting guests and by about 5 PM I was no longer enjoying it as much and left (had business to attend to anyway). Still I was glad that I was able to experience what arguably is the most famous hotel pool in the world. As for the rest of the hotel, of course it is huge with over 2600 rooms in 3 towers, but considering this it still functions pretty smoothly.

"I don't know what I'd expected but given how monumental in size Marina Bay Sands is, I think I'd assumed bureaucratic service at a minimum. The truth of my experience is that everything was great, from check-in to checkout. While there was a short line at check-in, it moved rapidly and in a minute or two we were checked in by an efficient and caring person. The room itself was spacious, well maintained, and had a view to die for. When we had questions, there was always someone available to provide professional and patient advice. The concierge took a lot of time to understand the type of place we wanted to go for dinner, explain what to expect, and gave us detailed instructions on how to get there (and the dinner itself was epic) -- in other words, he did his job very well.

The gym was a decent size with new and working equipment, which an incredible view over Singapore. The rooftop infinity pool is by far the highlight. With bar service to your sunbed, and a view of a lifetime, it's hard to beat.   The area underneath the hotel is also very good. We were given a free ticket to the Venice inspired gondolas that went for a short drift thorough a man made canal through a part of the shopping centre, which we didn't get the chance to do but looked like fun.

Rooms are spacious and well set out, clean and with everything you need. Even though its a big hotel, service remains personal and friendly. I stayed here for business and pleasure and it doesn't disappoint. Not sure why they put you in tower 3 if your at the conference centre, as its the furthest tower away? Its happened to me twice on two different occasions.  Of course its expensive, but not much different than any other hotel or restaurant in Singapore.

But: the water is little cold, and at the evening, it was not nice at all to get inside the pool. Hundreds of people with cameras. I think it is way overpriced and overrated. 500 SNG dollars is a theft. Stay of Raffles. More expensive, but you get, what you pay for.",3,1/7/2022
Generally felt that this is a rooms factory.  Service all around was poor.  Room was big which was the only blessing and pool was great.

Stayed for a night as it was a little beyond our price range for anymore time than that. The room was huge with fantastic facilities throughout. The hotel itself is very impressive and a stunning place to spend 24 hours. The Skypark on the roof with the infinity pool give you the postcard panorama of Singapore that you just can't get anywhere else. Very pricey but a once in a lifetime experience enjoyed.,5,1/10/2022
The most amazing hotel in Singapore. Wished i didn't have to leave! I stayed here as a stopover to the Maldives and now wish i had stayed longer! The Sky park is truly a unique experience that everyone should see! Customer service was amazing. There is also a huge shopping centre and casino in the hotel so you don't even have to leave the hotel if you are there to relax!

We were also very impressed with the housekeeping staff who would check a number of times each day with us whether we required any extra amenities. The view from the infinity pool was amazing and we spent a number of days enjoying the pool area and hot tubs. There is definite room for improvement in terms of service. Check in and out was incredibly crowded with long wait times. In a hotel this size I can not understand why they have such small service desks with only a few staff.

"We stayed at the hotel last week, but we have never ever been asked to put down a deposit to stay in a hotel. The Marina Bay Sands hotel charges 400 Singapore dollars which is about £200 Deposit.          Yes you get the money back once you check out, but it wrong as the hotel has the money in there account which they would get interest on I think. On the plus side it's a very nice very large hotel with three towers and a ship on top which has beautiful scenery with a swimming pool and restaurants. Across the the hotel is a shopping Mall with very expensive shops where there are more staff then Customers in store.",5,1/14/2022

"I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip as it is very convenient for the convention center. I would suggest if you want to visit Singapore as a tourist this is not the place to stay. It is a typical large hotel similar to its relatives in Vegas, it has 2600 rooms and you are but a number. The staff are helpful if you can pin one down, however because of the volume of people staying and transiting through here it is very crowded constantly. My reservation did not specify what tower I was staying in so when the taxi from the airport dropped me off at tower 3 I was advised I was in tower 1 and had to walk the full distance of the property with all my luggage??

Booked one night in the Marina Bay Sands as a treat and were a bit apprehensive due to the mixed reviews. We need not have worried one bit as the hotel and staff were all fabulous. Check in took a little bit longer than usual but once we got to the desk the receptionist was very helpful and even gave us a free room upgrade and later than usual check out. The room had a great view of the city and was brilliant in every way. The highlight was of course the rooftop infinity pool which we managed to visit 3 times in 24 hours.  Overall we had a brilliant stay in the MBS and although it is expensive it's definitely the place in Singapore to spoil yourself.,5,1/20/2022
We arrived in the evening at the MBS and was asked to checking in. This is a very big 5 star hotel however there were only 3 staff on check-in which meant a long wait. Eventually got into the room which was fantastic with great views. Next morning went to enjoy the infinity pool and even though I had consulted the hotel manual AND we had talked to the front desk about going no-one mentioned that each attendee must have their own room card to get in. Another trip back to the room to pick up the 2nd key down 2 lifts. before getting in. Again the view and amenities were fantastic. Back down and made use of TV check out so as not to spend another 30 minutes in the queue to check out which was a plus. Asked for help by the concierge desk again long queue but very helpful staff.…,4,1/21/2022
"We stayed at the MBS during 2 nights. Everything went fine, apart for some confusion during the reservation (it doesn't help that you cannot have a conversation with the same person; every time it's a different employee).  Our check-in was perfect, the room was even ready before the time. Our kids loved it, and enjoyed very much the swimming pool. The only dissapointing aspect of the stay would be breakfast, quite expensive.",4,1/22/2022
"This place is certainly worth visiting as a tourist attraction, it is unique and judging by the tour groups constantly in the lobby people have gotten the word.   I stayed for nearly a week and that is too long for a hotel like this. The rooms are nice but the thing is MBS is a volume business, when you stay here you are one of thousands, there is no individual service.    The place is very crowded, you will not receive the type of service you would at similarly priced hotels and that's the thing, I don't mind the prices I do mind be treated like a passenger waiting for a bus for these prices.  The main breakfast area is the worst example of this, it's like be part of an assembly line being served by robots.  ",3,1/23/2022
"I've been here to discover the infinitive pool, and ok, the pool is amazing and great views from there, but it was plenty of Japanese doing selfies with a gopro, screaming kids, bacterias everywhere... It's was like a Disneyland resort in a rooftop!    Rooms are very very standard, no sense for decoration, poor amenities, cold atmosphere and in your room desk you have to read things like 'we recommend to go breakfast before 8:30 or after 10:00 if not you can find long queues' what!? Tops restaurant are very ugly, with white and simply furniture, standard quality food... Staff friendly. A little bit far from the city center. If you like shopping malls here you can find a big one.  The hotel main lobby architecture are breathtaking amazing! ",2,1/24/2022
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands at the end of a cruise. We may have overpaid. The posted rate is $900.  It takes a while to get oriented to the elevators and attached mall.  We hardly left the immediate area. The concierge desk was very helpful with staff of several nationalities. They gave us a booklet of restaurants in the mall and maps. There is also an information desk at the entrance to the mall from tower 3. The pool is stunning. Everyone is taking ""selfies"" and there is a professional photographer in a wet suit. They are very strict about only allowing registered guests in the pool area. We enjoyed a day at the Gardens by the Bay which we could see from our balcony. There is an easy way to get there from the MRT area of the mall.",5,1/25/2022
"The stunning vista, the views and the overall experience far out way the small negatives. I love Singapore and its people and this hotel exemplifies the Modern Singapore experience. Some bizarre features such as no fridge in the room but they will bring you one for $10, a whole fridge plonked on the desk! You are not allowed to eat peanuts by the pool? I'm nit picking here, I can get a cheap fridge to cool the wine and I can live without a peanut for a few hours of stunning city views from the infinity pool on the 57th floor! Well recommended.",4,1/26/2022

Great location near the Gardens and very easy to get around to the other attractions.  The staff were very efficient and helpful and all the ammenities were what you would expect from a five star hotel. The infinity pool on the rooftop is amazing to see and to take a dip in although the number of people taking selfies was a little off putting. We enjoyed our meals and particularly enjoyed the cheese and chocolate buffet although one night was enough for our hips! We were also able to book to see a live show at the theatre- Mumma Mia, which was great fun. On our final day we went to the Da Vinci exhibition at the…",5,1/27/2022

"Let's start from arrival. One of the longests check in time. Lobby area is huge and crowded like in airport. Breakfast is far not private, but more like a snack at a train station. Food is good there though. The rooftop place is absolutely the best we've ever seen. Looking at all MBS reviews it is clear: people are impressed by rooftop view. Agree with that. My advice about staying in Singapore: coming for vacation - book hotel near river walk (SwissHotel, etc); coming for couple of days for business - MBS is good. In any case - visit MBS rooftop.",3,1/30/2022
"Some folks don't understand or for that matter realize that the Marina Bay Sands is a ""one stop shop"" for travelers. It is of course pricey and if you are not planning on taking advantage of the immense amount of on ground things they have to offer then by all means stay somewhere more economical. If however you want a Casino, Sky Park amazing grounds of endless fascinating sights ....laser shows etc....LOL then this place can not be beat. Also you have to consider that for all practical purposes breakfast and dinner and drinks are included. You can't beat this place with a big ole stick in my opinion. Keep up the good work guys.",4,1/31/2022
"This hotel is a hotel is a city within a city. Once here  there is no need to go anywhere.  The three powerful tall towers are massive  and  hold over  400 rooms each  and together  hold  up the longest pool ever built up in the air. It is a very busy  hotel, too crowded and too  loud for my taste. Casinos, restaurants,  and a constant in and out of locals and guests . It is not a value for money but a definite tourist attraction.  Make a visit to the the 58th floor  pool  for a nice clear view of Singapore . From here  one can see  as far as the eyes can reach.  The pool up above the top of the towers is the unusual novelty of this hotel.",3,2/1/2022
this hotel i like the best for the infinite sky pool and also very continence for the casino and conversion center near by . right cross the street is big huge mall . great custom service and very close to MRT and lots of nice restaurants around. will definitely come back stay again,5,2/2/2022
"What an amazing area of Singapore.  A terrific hotel and shopping complex with a stunning rooftop infinity pool, 57 story views, good food and helpful service.  The check/in/out queues can be a little long but other than that great.  Our room was spacious and had a panoramic view of Marina Bay.  the Gardens at the back of the hotel are stunning along with the 'flower trees' and the cloud dome. It all lights up at night into a vivid laser/light sound show at the hotel and the gardens.  Try it just once in your life.",5,2/3/2022
"We, two couples stayed in MBS very recently. Everything is very nice about this premium property . The location, ambiance, rooms, services etc. everything is excellent. The night view from d edge of roof top pool is just WOW. It cant be explained in words. Somehow we had a feeling on arrival which I would like to share with d readers that Indians are being unnecessarily discriminated. Although we had prior booking thru our agent, we were told at 8-00 am that we can go to d top pool and wait for d room which may be be ready by 3-00 pm. The dealing girl was not assuring us about d floor and which room we will get and when, in spite of our repeated requests. After about half an our we contacted a gentleman with an Indian name in the reception counter and requested for a room. This…",5,2/4/2022
Stayed here for a conference. It's Singapore so it's not cheap. Casino and plenty  of high end shopping.   Food court is very affordable with great selection. Hotel is extremely comfortable with all expected amenities. Infinity pool and observation deck are a must. Conveniently located.  Nice high end digs,5,2/5/2022
"We booked a Club room and had no issue with check in. Our room was gorgeous and the Club lounge friendly and had good food. I must say the infinity pool seems too small for the hotel. Over 2500 rooms and its mayhem most of the day. If they had a second pool for you to laze around and swim in it would be perfect. The lobby reminds me of an airport check in, with long lines for check in and key collect. Surely some smart person can think of a way to improve this. In the mean time I think the hotel would win hearts if they had water and snacks delivered to the queues and perhaps a few friendly faces trouble shooting and calming down the masses. A Club room comes with express check in. Its nearly all there but needs a few tweaks. It simply isn't a good look to go to the lobby and…",4,2/6/2022
"I stayed here for a few nights earlier this year as I was attending a conference. The main entrance and facilities of the lobby were impressive. I ended up attending the circular bar near the main entrance many times during my stay for their non-alcoholic cocktails and snacks.  Access to casino and the MTR was fantastic being literally steps away. The view from their roof top infinity edge pool was unsurpassed. The view from my mid-level room was very good. However, I found the decor of the central atrium between the rooms somewhat dormitory like, rather than a five star luxury hotel. Service was attentive. Cost me about 500 AUD per night but worthwhile.",5,2/7/2022
"Great hotel! Great staff, very happy helpful and accommodating! Great view! Great everything! Great pool! Would come back here anytime I visit Singapore! I would recommend it to any of my friends family or anyone for that matter",5,2/8/2022
"Firstly,the room facilities cannot match with the 5 stars hotel. If you come for the infinity pool, you will say:""wow....hmmm...that's it?"" Sometimes there will be a party besides the pool at night, lady is free.  One more thing, if you would like to luxury shopping, it's the best place for u.",3,2/9/2022

"The lobby is stunning. Large and airy with a beautiful sculpture that dances with the light. The queue for check-in was fairly long, but we were pulled out by a staff member and asked to check-in at another, much shorter line. We were unexpectedly given an upgrade to a corner suite (not even loyalty member with their program)! The room was on the 19th floor with a beautiful view of both the marina and the bay. I'll always remember the sunrise coming up over the bay, the ships, the Gardens by the Bay casting Avatar-like shadows. It was amazing.   The hotel is busy with lots of guests and tourists roaming around. We only stayed a night (mostly to enjoy the pool -- completely worth it), so we didn't get a chance to enjoy all of the related amenities.   We had a great stay and would…",5,2/11/2022

This is  number one  from world famous  hotel  where I like  be  back again and again",5,2/12/2022
"Although a visually impressive structure, Marina Bay Sands is very overpriced and lacks the 5* service and quality of other more established hotels. The hotel lobby is very crowded and the pool is always extremely busy. The pool lounges are poorly maintained hence they are no longer white but grimy. The room itself, a suite, was very spacious with a beautiful view of the gardens however had a repugnant odor in the entranceway.   Room service was very average, took a long time and was well overpriced. Very disappointedly the food trolley and food were not removed from our room until late the next day (over 15 hours later) and the room had not been turned down until very late afternoon (after 4pm).  Checking out would have been a huge hassle if it had not been for the self-service…",3,2/13/2022
"Spent 7 nights in Singapore at the Marina bay sands hotel with my wife.   The hotel itself is certainly spectacular, impressive design and quite imposing to say the least. When we pulled into the hotel, I expected to get my car directly to the front of the hotel and a doorman would get my door while other members of staff swiftly removed my bags from the trunk of the car and whisked them off to my room. Was this what I got? NO!  Maybe I was wrong to think a 5* hotel would do the above.   My wife and I after a 17 hour trip had to get the bags ourselves and lug them into the hotel. No member of staff came over to help or even greet us.... Needless to say, I thought we had made the wrong choice of hotel for our trip.  Despite the above, the poor service stopped and the rest of our…",4,2/14/2022
"My husband and I always stay here with our little baby.  Out of all the hotels in Singapore we find this one our favourite. Probably because its connected to the shopping mall. You don't need to take a taxi just walk across. If you need food theres a lot of restaurants.   The gym in the hotel is world class...Massive...  And of course its very relaxing up top, amazing views while you swim or tan.  For us its the all rounder!",5,2/15/2022
"Great stay at the Marina Bay sands. We came mainly for the pool which was awesome. But, the pool was COLD! It didn't stop everyone from using it though. Pool was busy but we could always manage to find a seat.   The room was nice and we had a nice balcony and view of the gardens. Service was very pleasant.  It is not a boutique hotel but was fun to be staying in such a busy location with the mall right there for convenience. Had free wifi (a hotel must for me)  Check in was a bit slow but it was busy. Make sure to do the self-checkout for speed. We would stay again.",5,2/16/2022
"We were really looking forward to our stay in MBS even if we live in Singapore, booking a room is the only way to access the famous infinity pool ! We decided to go there for our son 10th birthday and book a premium room with city views. The feeling you get as soon as you walk in is to be in a busy airport terminal. LOTS  of people everywhere. After a queue to check in, the very nice lady behind the counter said she could upgrade us to a suite on 48th floor if we were willing to wait 1hour, we did and went for a drink at the bar. Tables and sofas were quite dirty and service was slow. After 1h we queued again to get our key card. No one to tell you where to go or help you with the luggages. Room was very nice, huge with stunning views. Then we rushed  to the pool;)  ok the views…",3,2/17/2022
Marina Bay Sands is probably one of my favourite hotels to stay in. The rooms have beautiful bathrooms and the pool is breathtaking. One of the best things about the pool is that there is an Adults only section which is much less noisy. Evening Canapés and the breakfast at the Club is a must. The breakfast has a superb and wide selection of all types of food and the afternoon Canapés ensures free flow of any type of alcohol you choose.. The hotel is also conveniently linked to the shopping arcade where theres a food court if you are looking for cheap meal options. The MRT Bayfront is just below the hotel itself (don't get off at the Marina Bay MRT!). The lobby of the hotel is almost always crowded though!  I've stayed here twice and will most definitely go back !,5,2/18/2022
"I was impressed with the fit and finish - everything looked new, everything was high end, there were no false touches.  The view onto the port was fabulous. The park outside the hotel was very pleasant. Be aware that hotel is very large and full of people - a real high volume operation.",5,2/19/2022
"The Hotel is very nice but very big, the service in the Hotel is also very good. Sometimes there are VERY long queues at checkin and checkout but the hotel took  measures to make it convenient and fast. Nevertheless, the hotel is not very exclusive. The main attraction is definitely the rooftop pool, which is very crowded and besides the excellent view and the mandatory selfie, there is no reason to use it. The restaurants on the top are nice, but the service is lousy. As I have seen it and been there, I will pick a different one next time in SIN.",3,2/20/2022
"Marina Bay Sands  Singapore  - Except for the Club restaurant areas and the lounge and restaurant Sky on 57,  service is abysmal , and the premium rate that you are going to fork for your stay is in no way related to the subpar service that you ll receive, whatever Suite or room you might have chosen.  If you re very lucky (and very deep pocketed) you may try your luck at the VIP Checkin facility at your own risk  - Check In may easily take up to an hour and a half , due to large groups  Most people come here for one basic thing , have a selfie in the 57th pool with Sin in the background ; You must be a hotel guest to have access to the pool hence the thunder crowds  The only way to lower the crowd pressure is to get a room/suite with CLUB Access the afternoon tea , evening…",1,2/21/2022
My wife and I stayed 3 nights in a City View room and we found it breathtaking. The hotel is an iconic building of Singapore and the pool enjoys outstanding views. The hotel is a big property with 3 towers so quiet crowded and busy. The service is very good and the staff helpful and polite. The gym is also well equipped and you can have a jog while admiring the city view. Breakfast is served on the 57th and is quiet delicious: you can also order 2 items from the menu and it's included in the breakfast so everything is served fresh and warm. Needless to say: the hotel is connected to the MRT station although taxis are quiet cheap in Singapore and distances are usually short. ,4,2/22/2022
I stayed there for new years a few years back The hotel was a complete chaos It took them one hour yo get the luggage to the room Half an hour for check in The hotel is so big you literally take ten mins to reach the restaurant for breakfast from your room with all the waiting for the lift I would think twice The hotel and staff were good bit so are some of the other hotels in singapore,3,2/23/2022
"The whole purpose of going to this hotel wasn't really the hotel (although the service has been great). it was the pool thats the main attraction. We spent the whole day out at sentosa island with all those rides and everything. By the time we got to the hotel the first thing was the infinity pool. Must say, worth every cent. Though i suggest you go at night if you intend to actually want to swim or chill. less kids, less annoying people on the balcony taking pics of you swmming. On a minor note, just be aware that there are plenty of idiots taking their selfies standing right in the middle of the pool blocking your way thinking they're top notch models. Then they'll complain you're getting them wet coz you're swimming. word of advice, ignore them and splash harder XD",5,2/24/2022
"It is well located - near the garden and a train station. Below is a shopping centre and of course there is a casino, restaurants etc all available in this massive building. Our room was nice, and luckily we were up quite high facing the gardens. To get good views, you would want a room up high.   But it was not really worth the price. The room was simple, and clean, but not overly spacious for that price. And there were no extras included in that price. And the pool, of course. We went up around 9pm at night, and it was so busy. There were no places to put our things, and really, I didn't want to jump in a pool with that may people. Especially since most people were just posing for selfies in the pool and not really enjoying it anyway. But we decided to set an alarm for when…",3,2/25/2022
"After travelling for a month we wanted to stay somewhere special to end out travels. It has got to be said the views and pool area is very special and an experience in its self. Putting this aside there was a couple of things that did disappoint us about this hotel. Firstly, check out is 11am this we do not have a problem with but with our flight only being at 8pm we asked if we could stil use the hotel facilities due to our late flight. We was told that this was a against the hotel rules but we could store our baggage. I have never been to a hotel before where you are not allowed to use the facilities after check out. So we had a day to waste and with there being nowhere to sit in the lobby unless we payed for a meal and drinks spending more money in the hotel seemed the only…",4,2/26/2022
"We stopped here for 1 night at the end of an Asian trip, and a thoroughly enjoyable stay was had.  Upon arrival, the bell boy collects your luggage and provides a receipt which is then scanned as part of the check in process, and your bags taken up to your room.  Check in was quick (not much of a line) and we were seen more or less straight away. We had booked a superior room, but asked if we could upgrade to a club room. After a couple of minutes of checking the computer, we were advised that we could, for a charge of S$180. After we agreed to pay this charge, we wanted to check that this would be a city view. Wrong! A city view took the charge up to S$240! Nontheless, as it was our last night of our trip, we agreed to pay.  The room was on the 42nd floor, and was very spacious…",5,2/27/2022
"Great views, expensive drinks yet well worth the visit. A group of us entered the third tower to get a card to get up to the bar in the elevator. The views of Singapore are spectacular from the bar and the drinks are gorgeous, if not a tad expensive.  Well worth a visit at least once, maybe twice but not three times.",4,2/28/2022
Stayed here with my family.  Excellent facilities.  The gym is located on the 56th floor with spectacular view of the city skyline.  The room is rather spacious and faced the harbor.  Very scenic. A lot of choices of restaurants including a really good food court at the shopping mall.  The casino seems crowded but looks organized.,5,3/1/2022
Checked in this hotel few hours ago and already feel like checking out now!! Power cut off twice ! Although it was only 15 mins but not expecting this to happen at a 5 star hotel! Service was bad and too crowded.,1,3/2/2022
"Now don't get me wrong, I'm a budget traveller so yes the hotel was grand compared to some of the places I've stopped in. But for what you pay i think certain areas are a let down and could be improved. We booked two nights here simply because we loved the look of the pool, shopping area and simply for some luxury while we travelled.  Checking in was fine, 5-10 mins all in, the girl was a bit vague with the on goings of the hotel and offers....but got a free upgrade as the room wasn't ready so we got a higher floor, bigger room and a bathtub. Very pleased with the room clean, quiet, tidy, spacious, tv great, view of the gardens great. The only let down was the internet. Don't get me wrong theres free wifi by the pool which is good ( the free one around the concierge was poor)…",4,3/3/2022
"The check in is chaotic, the staff are hit n miss & most are unable to assist (or have better things to do). Mostly inflexible and repetitive good to apologise (even for waiting when there was hardly a wait) so that says a lot! Electrical breakdown spoilt out first night AND we were stuck with no electricity for an hour on our last lay! So I am now wondering what to do for breakfast before we check out! Too many people and too little care for guests - and oh the Sky pool is overcrowded at all times and much smaller (very narrow) - only offers good views and photo opportunity. If you are looking for a 5 star stay there are much better hotels that are far better run than this one! Be warned!",4,3/4/2022
"Stayed here for 3 nights recently for a romantic stay.  The very comfortable room had a lovely city view but the bathroom was a disappointment. The toiletries were by no means luxurious and in short supply. The stand-alone bath had no shelf near at hand for toiletries etc when we decider to swim, there were no loungers available. Four had been reserved for VIPs according to the pool attendant. For the premium price we paid, I wondered how much more it could possibly cost to reserve a lounge chair!! I found this distasteful for a hotel of this standard. The exorbitant room rates do not include breakfast or even a commentary fruit basket. Service was overall very good but if you are willing to spend on a break in which to feel special and pampered this is not the place. ",4,3/5/2022
"stayed here for 3 nights, I had read a few reviews saying it was overcrowded and took ages to get checked in but there was no problems at all. I can imagine the rooftop pool would be busy as you would expect but the hotel and shopping centres are that big it doesn't seem overcrowded. we had a city view room on floor 46, what an amazing view. the rooms were spotless and cleaned every day, comfy beds and a massive tv! its across the river from the Singapore flyer so don't bother spending $35 on the flyer as you can see everything from the top level and walk right the way around, although you have to be staying in the hotel to get up there. the hop on hop off bus was good, along with a trip to raffles for a Singapore sling and eating my weight in peanuts and throwing the shells on…",5,3/6/2022
"There is no doubt Marina Bay Sands or MBS as the locals would popularly call it, that it is an amazing landmark. Word class design and facility are just few if the praises however, the whole area can get too busy you don't have much privacy other than being in your hotel room. The rooms facing the park is what u should choose when booking, not only can u see the fabulous night view of it but also the ocean breeze to kiss your face when u come out of your balcony.

"I have great expectations for this hotel, due to its price, but its disappointing that my expectations were not equalled by the hotel. We got the premiere city room view and was given the 42nd floor. The room is big but very basic. It lacks the warm feel of home, I'm not sure why? Or maybe it's because of the cold and fast-paced nature of Singapore and Singaporeans that I felt the room and the whole hotel cold. The room was a huge space with a king-size bed in white linens, accentuated with a cream sofa and a square glass table to fill up the space then basically it's everything that you see in the room. There was no welcome note under my name. Something that any old hotels, like Shangri-la, would always do to make its customers welcomed. It's expensive because the rate only…",3,3/8/2022
"Everything is great except the price. With this price my room doesn't have a bath tub. Compare to the other hotels with the same price range they do! So for me it just a little bit pricey. Anyway, Amazing view even though a view from my room is facing Garden by the bay. Prime location. Great and helpful service even though there were hundred of people waiting to be served at a period of time. Great Sky park and infinity pool (but too many people). It's like you come to visit an attraction of Singapore. Lot's of people and hard to find your own space in public area.

Hotel Location: Right in the heart of things at the Marina with great views and easy access to rest of city. The actual hotel is massive and easy to spot but some information should be gathered before arrival to make sure you know which tower you are staying in and even better you can arrange the VIP check in.   Check in: It was fast and efficient as I had contacted the hotel in advance and therefore managed to slide past the huge crowds of hotel residents and visitors for a quick check in.  Room: This was large and had everything you expect from a 5 star hotel. The views were amazing as well.  Room Service: Extensive menu and fast delivery. Good delicious food.

We booked the club rooms which meant our rooms should have been between the 39th - 49th floor, and we had club access on the 57th floor where the infinity pool is.  On checkin I noticed the queue was huge for the normal rooms, and I was pretty happy that we had booked the club rooms! Whilst the guests including us waited around there wasn't any staff presence or welcome of any kind! Which I thought was a little weird. I felt like I was checking in to a flight and not to a hotel!.

We stayed here purely because this was the conference venue.  Overly priced to start with.  The hotel consists of three towers and the distance between tower one and three is very far especially when you have to dodge 1000 people. We were not told which tower we were staying so had to walk the other end after check in. But I overheard another staff telling the guests behind us that they came to the wrong reception and had to walk to the other end to check in. Chinese restaurant we dined was good but nothing outstanding.  Everything else is so plastic including the Shoppes adjacent to the hotel.

Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a conference.  It's a monster of a property with amazing views...BUT (isn't there always a but...) it's so large that as an individual traveler you get lost in the shuffle.  Head to the pool area on the 57th floor for incredible views of the city.  (I believe there is a fee for those not staying in the hotel).  Had some extra time my first day there and went to sit by the pool...never once was approached by a waitress for any type of beverage.  That was a turn off.  Had a cocktail at the outdoor bar on the 57th floor and it cost $24 Singaporean.  INSANE ... for a little bitty cocktail.  Prices for food and beverage within the hotel are quite expensive.

"Of course our main reason to stay in the hotel was the infinity pool. And I think it is totally worth it to stay here for at least one night, because the infinity pool is breathtaking!!   We stayed here for 3 nights and had a room with cityview. I highly recommend this to everyone. It is just stunning to open the door of the hotel room and then the curtains open automatically so that you immediately see over Singapore!   The room offered enough space. We had a room with twin beds. I really liked the bathroom which is also quite big.   Of course you do also have a perfect view over Singapore from the gym and the Skypark bar.

Naturally it was pretty pricey but I expected the rooms to be better than they were.  They were nice but nothing over-the-top special. The pool area was fantastic, as were the views, but it was VERY crowded and hard to find loungers near the pool. It was nice to be in the pool at night and to see the light shows etc on the harbour below. The shopping centre attached to the hotel has some very high-end labels and I didn't see many people in the actual shops....more window shopping!

"The Marina Bay Sands is a fully integrated Resort and Casino, and whilst it hits a lot of high notes there are a few things that can impact on the enjoyment of the hotel.  The obvious highs, both physically and metaphorically is the pool and entertainment areas on the roof top deck. The pool area is amazing and the views really set the atmosphere.  The rooms are very comfortable and cater for all requirements of a  5 star hotel. The key issue that I had with MSB is that the size of the place makes it very impersonal. If staying in tower 3 it is around 10 to 15 minutes to get to the lobby lounge where breakfast is served. The check in area feels like an airport, so you don't feel like you are checking into a resort. We also used the convention centre and the free wifi was woeful…",4,3/22/2022

It can get a bit crowded, especially at check in and out. But we didn't wait long.  French Champagne on the Poolbar was good value for money at 18 SGD per glass. The pool wasn't as crowded as i expected, but it can take a while to find a sunbed next to the pool. We'll be back! ",5,3/25/2022
"My husband and I had such a wonderful stay! A little tip - We got the Club Room and I highly recommend you opt for this too! Situated on the 35th to 49th floors, you get a 62-square metre room and access to The Club at Marina Bay Sands which comes complete with Afternoon Tea and Cocktail & Canapé Hour.

"Experience the infinite pool on marina baysands, alot of chinese girls at night :) and families at morning thru afternoon. Great place to relaxin room, big! They offer free baby coat which is awesome! Checkin are great. You have a complete package if you stay here. But it is very pricey. But worth it to stay for a night. Stay more lower priced hotel with the same services will be great. ",5,3/27/2022
"10--12nov was our 3rd visit to Marinabay n as usual everything was just perfect . Service was great especially when checking in..efficient n fast. To top this,the hotel is ideally located with a splendid view n easy access to tourist attractions. For shoppers,casino /gourmet enthusiats,children anyone can find  something of interest here.

"The hotel is beautiful. It is a landmark in Singapore. The room is good and clean. The view is amazing but some problems happened. In the second day, when I left my room, I put the sign to clean on. When I arrived at 3:30pm, the room had not been done. I called the clerk who sent someone immediatly to clean my room. The day after, before I left my room I called the room service to make my room.  The same thing happened when I arrived. The room had not been done. The same thing I did, called the clerk, etc. After that I went to the reception and talked to the manager and the problem qas definitly solved. The breakfast is good but there are too many people.  The swiming pool, the highlight in the hotel, is totally crowded. The first time that I arrived at the pool, I just had my…",3,3/29/2022
"The hotel has a kerbside WOW factor, and the 'reception' area is huge. However booking in is slow, even when you are the only one in the queue. We were upgraded - which was nice, but when you see that the room was Sin$900 a night you do wonder what you are paying for.  The view was incredible, a beautiful view of the gardens and the sea, but the room was 'nice' - it was sleek and clean but generic.  The pool is what really sells this hotel and it doesn't disappoint. At times we were the only people there and it was serene. However when it gets a bit busier - which thankfully wasn't very busy - everyone was just taking photos and selfies! It is a place to pose!  One very useful feature is the subway/ underground station under the hotel which makes getting most places very easy,…",4,3/30/2022
"Having read some previous reviews after I had booked the hotel I was a bit anxious about our forthcoming stay at this hotel. However we had nothing to worry about. We arrived at the hotel at around 11am. We were allowed to store our bags and were told to return around 12 when the check counters would be open. We returned at 12 expecting to be told that a room would not be ready at 3pm. The queue was long but we were whisked away to the VIP counter and was checked in very quickly and allocated a room immediately. The room was spacious , clean and had all the facilities you would expect. During our stay the staff were friendly and were able to help us. Check out was again easy as we used the express check out machine and we were able to store our luggage until we had to leave to…",4,3/31/2022
"I don't think I want to stay this hotel again... I think no one doubt the view from the swimming pool on 57/F is magnificent and offer us extraordinary experiences. I actually also think so, but only just the view and “Infinity Pool”… The most thing I anxious about was the water in that pool may be definitely not be kept clean because they don’t have shower facilities we can use before getting into the pool even so flooded with people every time. The water was not spoiled fortunately but smelling chlorine. Morning buffet at “RISE” on 1/F was totally satisfied me with several kind of cuisine. They have egg centre and noodle centre, so we can enjoy it fleshly. But I think that is not special among luxury hotel. In fact, I think morning buffet at Pan Pacific Singapore is same grade…",3,4/1/2022
"My husband had a work event at the expo and so I got to stay at MBS for 4 nights. It was quite a treat as we normally would not have paid as much for a hotel. Check in and check out was quick and easy for me even though many people said they had to queue for a long time. The room was spacious and comes with an amazing view. I got the view of gardens by the bay and it was a stunning sight when it's all lit up at night. Housekeeping was fantastic, keeping our rooms clean and well stocked with drinking water, TWG teas and bedroom slippers laid out. The infinity pool is not to be missed of course and is probably the best part of the stay. The Banyan Tree gym has great views too but is rather small with not enough floor space for freestyle floor work. This is not a typical hotel with…",4,4/2/2022
"We arrived early in the morning around 7 am, so naturally no room was ready for us. However, the efficient and polite check-in staff provided us key cards to access the pool area and had our luggage stowed with the bellman. The infinity pool on Marina Bay Sand's roof  was our main reason to stay there so we were happy we already got pool access. Unfortunately, when we arrived, a photo shooting was still in progress and herds of people were already waiting to hit the pool. Even more annoying was that they kept moving the opening time back and back (from 8:30 to 9 to 9:30). However, once we were let in, the area was absolutely stunning and amazing.  The rooms were large and luxuriously fitted with all amenities you can think of. Everything was spotlessly clean and we slept like…",4,4/3/2022
"I checked in at around 5pm on a Sunday and the lines were terribly long. At check in the information was wrong and inconsistent with my reservation, had to wait for a room to be cleaned when check in time is 3pm and the flight details was provided.    Check out was even worse.  They charged me for breakfast which was included in the room and had resolve this again.  I had asked to use a different credit card for check out and the machine had an issue which I had to call my bank and spent 30 minutes at the check in counter to resolve the issue.  When I returned I got 2 bills and duplicate credit card charges and realized I was double charged.  I spent 2 hours trying to resolve the issue with their finance and still not resolved and they need another day.    The rooms were fine…",1,4/4/2022
"As other reviews have indicated, the hotel is enormous and so lacks the sense of luxury you might expect for the rate. The lobby in particular has an airport feeling, with dozens and dozens of people busily moving around or just waiting with their luggage.  The staff were very good, we were on our honeymoon and were granted an upgrade to a club room, which was great. The room was huge, though lacked charm. We were only on the 7th floor unfortunately, but the sea/gardens view was still good.  The main benefit to MBS is of course the sky park, and this is truly fantastic, though perhaps without a real sense of luxury or exclusivity. We had a rainy and very overcast day, unfortunately. it was very busy, but there is an adults-only section.  Would I go back? No, but I'm glad I…",4,4/5/2022
Stayed over for 1 night in MBS. Have a wonderful time over there. My little girl loves the sky park pool. Only setback is I can't use the float for my girl in the pool. Overall experience is fantastic!!! I would like to come back again........,5,4/6/2022
Nice view from the balcony. Wi-fi's everywhere and the staffs are helpful. It is worth the money spent for staying at this hotel. In addition the hotel has infinity edge pool that is so beautiful to see the night city view ,5,4/7/2022
"We stayed here as a ""treat"" before going backpacking for 6 months around Asia. We checked in early and the reception staff were very accommodating in booking us in and making the room available.  The room we had on 43rd floor was large with a stunning view over the gardens by the bay. The bathroom was also luxuriously sized. Unfortunately for me the bed wasn't made to the highest of standards as part of the linen wasn't tucked in, some of the frosting on the glass in the bathroom had come away. Finally the air-con unit seemed overly loud during the night which stopped me from sleeping well (not something I've had an issue in any of the subsequent hostels or hotels). These aren't big niggles and didn't report it, but things I would have expected to be picked up in a 5* hotel…",4,4/8/2022
"Finally made it to MBS this year for our 24 wedding anniversary, would like to say thank you to all the staff for making it a memorable one! the receptionist at the check in counter was very helpful as check out time was 11.am she help us extend it till 1.pm when i told her that it was our anniversary and we would like to spent more time at the pool cause it was raining the day we check in...  and we ask to upgrade our room which was at a reasonable price. When it came to make payment...she could not make transaction on my credit card but she reassure me that it may have been some error on the machine and smile and i thank her for going an extra mile as we took a lot of her time. We love every moment of our stay though it was a short one.all the staff are very polite and…",5,4/9/2022
"With more than 2,500 rooms, the MBS is among the largest hotels in the world and is part of an integrated resorts including casino, restaurants, shopping center, theater... Keeping that in mind, you cannot expect the same kind of feeling as the one you would get in smaller luxury hotels, nonetheless the service was faultless and the staff attentive, always very helpful and kind.  The lobby is gigantic, giving the impression of entering in a shopping center rather than in a hotel, an army of staff ensures that you get the help you need (luggage sent directly to you room while you are checking in - or queueing to check in) and my experience has shown particularly pleasant persons, helping with real attention and care.  I booked a Premier room, it was  approx. 47sqm, in Tower 1 and…",4,4/10/2022
"We chosen a bay view which was really beautiful on the 40th floor. Was told that bay view starts from 19th floor.   The room is very spacious with a king bed as well as a double sofa bed. The deco is nice too. Would prefer a firmer bed as it was too soft for us.   Really love the set up except it doesn't come with a bath.  For local, there isn't self car parking except valet at S$6.  The mini bar is also well stock.  Good complimentary tea/coffee brands too.  ",4,4/11/2022
"My husband and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands from November 7th until November 9th in a Club Room. We got to the hotel quite early and they kindly gave us a room prior to check in time. Our room was situated on the 46th floor offering fantastic views of the city and a nice lightning show each night enhanced by the floor to ceiling windows (it felt like we could simply step off the side of the building!). The room itself was huge, After having stayed at another hotel prior to this one with a room significantly smaller, it was a bit of a shock. The bathroom was also large and the double door entrance gave it a very opulent feel. The pool is fantastic and thankfully provided plenty of room for guests so there was no over-crowding, as it was very busy. Once again, a fantastic way to…",5,4/12/2022
Have a fun time at MBS hotel with so many places to walk around. Pls be prepare that this place is huge and it be a long walk from even the carpark.  Room itself is wonderfully clean n comfortable. Huge bath room for kids to stay in the tub. Separate shower with a close door for number 2.  Hotel provided all the things u need for a short stay so u don't even have to bring anything for your bath.  Food are expensive in food court as compare to other places. Must well eat in the restaurants which have so so many around.  Need a drink?? I will Suggest the open carpark next to the conversation hall that holds a small corner bistro.  ,5,4/13/2022

"Came here with friends for a staycation in August. The pool has cool views, but enjoyed the Jacuzzi most of all since the main pool tends to be a little too overcrowded. We also loved to chill on their nice lounge chairs beside the pools. This is the life! We managed to get discounted rate for the stay and our room overlooks the Gardens by the Bay area. You could see the magical changing of lights and hear a little of the Songs of the Sea coming from the Supertree Grove at night. Beds are comfortable, and the toilet is huge. It is indeed a luxurious experience to stay in a hotel at such a great location with great views, and big spacious rooms, especially in the land-scarce Singapore.

I was prepared for the train terminal check in experience but while there was a line - it was not as bad as I was expecting. Shortly after joining the queue we were approached to wait in another checkin area where other families were also waiting and the little one could run around and stretch. Upon check in we were upgraded to a suite so our little one ""had more room to run around"" and also given a comp late checkout of 1pm  Service and staff were exemplary and FAST!

"Full disclosure, we weren't staying there, we were at the Shangri-La Valley Wing but thought we would check it out for next time. Upon arrival, we were herded and told we had to pay to go up which was factually wrong. We went up to the top and were told abruptly that the bar was closed for a private function. So the guys at the bottom didn't know that. We were sent to the other end after descending, Tower One. I asked a very unhappy concierge if we could buy a cocktail up there? To which he replied 'I think so'. We then went up the other tower and were greeted by a sour faced individual who sat us outside with no view. After waiting ten minutes we decided it was just a lousy tourist trap and all they had to offer was a view and we left. Now, as a potential new customer, the top…",2,4/18/2022
"This is a new chapter of our experiences in Singapore. Attractive design of the hotel, and large size of room, with a mall, a casino, with .. Well. It's a town. The services are impressive considering that this is a Casino hotel; far better services than those we normally got in Las Vegas Casino-Hotel.  On the 57th floor, it's a must visit. Breakfast on the 57th can not compare with breakfast in the lobby, but who cares. Look out for the great view of the long swimming pool on the rooftop with Singapore skyline as the backdrop. That is the real experience.  Unlike what you see in 007 Casino-Royale movie, no tux gamblers in the Casino. Plenty of T shirts, polo shirts and half length trousers here.

This suite had both a full bathroom & a powder room while the lounge area had a desk.  Well appointed, but the decor will probably need re doing soon if they want to keep charging the current prices. The rooftop pool is great with fabulous views but try KU DE TA Restaurant too. Great food & fabulous panoramic views of Singapore, partiicularly at night, when Singapore comes alive!",5,4/22/2022
Stayed at Marina Bay with my partner and a little one over the weekend. We were greeted on arrival by Stephanie who gave us exceptional customer service.

Many thanks. Jennifer,5,4/23/2022
May be I choose the wrong days to check in when the hotel was at its max occupancy ..... My checkin took two hours (yes they offered refreshments while standing in queue but having a kid with me didn't comfort us one bit) then the room service was taking eternity and the morning breakfast too had a waiting to be seated. The hotel is awesome so is the roof top experience and the pool but rooms are pretty normal. Casino and shopping all helps . This is a landmark in Singapore which you can and must try once but just pick the season when it's not to full occupancy. ,3,4/24/2022

Connectable throughout the hotel and shopping mall complex  The Cons: - Not sure what the 10% service charge was for. The bell boy delivered a wrong bag the first attempt. Other than that not much hotel services were performed  - Mistakenly charged a bottle of champagne from the minibar when nothing was consumed. It was a hassle having to email back and forth to request bill statement and arrange refund.  - No doorman at the front door was disappointing  - Queuing for check-in/check-out was a nightmare - Traffic at the front door can be chaotic.

I highly recommend room 2161 - totally loved it.  The views was great, the room was great and the bath tub was heaven!!!  The Infinity Pool was awesome.  Spectacular views of the city.  Whilst staying at the hotel, I didn't feel the need to go on the ferris wheel or do the bridge walk at Gardens by the Bay.  The views from the hotel allowed me to see everything so no need to pay to see something which was the same.  Service is top notch.

Some of the lobby signage could be improved, but once you get used to the lay out getting around is no problem. We arrived and checked in no issue got an upgrade to a garden view deluxe room on 36th floor.  The only thing I can say, which I have not seen in any other view, is the city view rooms don't have a balcony, only the garden view rooms do.

That is why we decided to book the The Club room and it was a very clever idea! The room was just great, clean, large and with an outstanding view over the city. Our breakfasts were served at The Club 57th floor and the choice was excellent as well as the food quality. I can'd but admire of the staff, which was always friendly and helpful. The Club at the 57th floor also offers afternoon tea and evening coctails, which could be like a light dinner, we took that advantage several times and enjoyed it pretty much.

Staff were curt but courteous as they were precise in instructions and directions. The breakfast spread is definitely something to boast of. The infinity pool can get quite crowded several times a day, but for a leisure traveler, waiting for the perfect moment to take a dip is no issue. The fact that the hotel is adjacent to one of the premier malls in the country is a sure advantage. And did I mention the view of the city is simply divine at any given time of the day? Definitely worth another stop in the near future!",5,5/2/2022

I think this is nicer than the city view - especially since you can see the city from the pool. Also you can watch the Gardens by the Bay light show from our room (the music is a little hard to hear).   The room was very large with small balcony and large bathroom with a stand alone tub. The staff were very good - we got complimentary fruit plate and 40% at the buffet (buffet was ok, plenty of fresh seafood). Honestly, its all about the pool - its truly an amazing view although it can get very busy. Just find a spot on the edge, take a selfie and watch the city below!

My non-smoking room smelled of cigarettes, even though there was a balcony where one could easily smoke without causing a stink (precisely the reason it was put there, I guess).  People rave about the views from the 57th floor but... Singapore is a totally flat and very small island. Those skyscrapers you can see from downstairs?

If you expect 5 star service then this is a bit of a hit and miss. Some staff members have exceptional customer service and others, appear to be very robotic. As soon as you enter the lobby, it feels like you are in a busy shopping centre. The rooms are extremely comfortable, clean & well designed with brilliant views - one of the bonuses was that we could get a smoking room (which is rare these days in 5 star hotels).

"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one of my three nights in Singapore on a stopover to Australia and found this hotel to be pretty poor experience.  Firstly, you are struck by the almost theme park theatrics on approach to the hotel - ""which tower are you in Sir"" with an array of vast numbers of tourists spilling out of the buildings entrances and exits as you try to navigate your way to the lobby.  When you walk in you feel like you've entered the Museum of Modern Art - big open spaces when you look up but at ground level there is just am endless swarm of tourists and visitors all shifting around and getting pin your way.

No one said that to us before we traipsed all the way up to the top floor with lifts that are always too busy and super slow. When I complained, all I got was this is policy. For a better stay in Singapore I think the nearby Westin hotel is way, way better and much more reasonably priced. I will never stay here again!!  This whole experience at MBS is distinctly mass market despite the very high room rates. The facilities on the 57th floor are teaming with tourist visitors making it feel more like Disney than…",1,5/19/2022
"I booked a suite containing from two spacious rooms. I paid for this the biggest amount of money I ever spend on 1 night in hotel and im not dissapointed. If I would pick up one more time I would choose just the regular room for the half of price because the most amazing in this hotel is the view from the window and the pool on the roof.  Food was great, service excellent, pool breathtaking.",5,5/20/2022
Yes the pool is awesome.  And if you only pick the place for the pool then you should stay here.   As for the rooms?   It was just ok and some very not ok parts.   The sheets had holes in them.  I asked them to change the sheets ALL 5 days I was there.  They never did.  The room accompaniments?   We're lacking as well.    The maids did an ok-- not great job.   It is a complete cluster when you check in.  It also took me 25 minutes to check out at 4:30 in the morning!   It's not like there was a long line.    The food here is a bit more than it should be.... But I'm ok with that if its good food.  It wasn't.    ,1,5/21/2022
"I find that Marina Bay Sand is not as good as it seems on the advertisement.  The pool is large and infinite, but seriously you could smell the strong chlorine from all the available pool (main pool, kids pool, and jacuzzi)..   I stayed for 5 days in the hotel, And I found out that the fitness centre was quite comfortable. Food choice was ok, nothing so extraordinary in my taste.  Honestly, I think it is a bit pricey and  I am not going to stay there in my next visit to Singapore.",2,5/22/2022
There is no doubt that the Marina Bay Sands is an outstanding architectural marvel in an up and coming area in Singapore. First impressions however were extremely poor with a 25 minute wait to check in. This was like standing in a bus queue with obviously over stretched staff. The receptionist was very helpful but she seemed to have to input an awful lot into the computer even though I had booked online. The room on the 40th floor was spectacular with jaw dropping views. The pool on the roof is one of a kind- it was so busy and there was no obvious input from the staff to ensure the adults only section of the pool and jacuzzi were without children. Ku De Ta restaurant on the roof was extremely poor service. Many waiters were standing about chatting to each other and were very…,4,5/23/2022
As you would expect this hotel is an incredible sight and an amazing place to stay.  I would definetly reccommed that anyone travelling to Singapore stay here just for the infinity pool alone. I can't wait to go back.,4,5/24/2022
"One of the reaons for staying in this hotel must be to swim at the rooftop pool - which is one of the largest and tallest pool in the world - it is on the 57th floor and offers a fantastic view of Singapore.  Now back to the basics: - Check in at 3pm, quite long queue but quite fast - The room itself is nicely furnished, with the usual amenities, sufficient lighting and a comfortable bed. - Now the bathroom   - The body wash/shampoo could have  been better   - The room we had does not have a bath tub - The room faces the garden, but that means the road as well, but fortunately, the sound-proofing was good, can hardly hear the traffic  Try to get a room with city view as it would be quieter and nicer. - The room comes with the usual amenities; but the fridge is those that is…",5,5/25/2022
"MBS's specialty in providing some of the worst hotel standards   The only real difference between this hotel and the casino across the road is that the casino  would probably give you better odds! A picture in the pool costs; in the range of 60 - 80 Sing per photo, a club/ bar that is 38 Sing to get in (for guests), sorry and includes one badly poured drink! And for what? being cramped into some corner, no visible view, as the place was too crowded. A fridge that cannot be used, if you want a fridge it will cost extra! A TV that broke, a shower which me and my girl friend struggled to change the temperate with, and basic bathroom amenities that would be of a low stand even on a AirAsia flight! Sorry, resulting in me leaving a ""redneck"" from the hotel - due to its corrosive…",1,5/26/2022
"This hotel is great if you set your expectations properly. It is not Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton, it is not 5-star luxury, personalized service. It is Marina Bay Sands, 2000+ rooms, it is madness, it is a resort. Know what to expect. We got an upgrade, the room was impressively spacious, so was the toilet. The staff were smiling, especially at the reception. Even though it was packed and they were supposed to be stressed, they smiled and treated us well. The  gave us directions and suggestions. What else to expect? We loved the pool, we took wonderful pics. Drinks and food there were good too. We went to the casino, and it was not like in las vegas, but still, it was a good pass time. Our best spot, CUT! Pricey but worth the price, without doubts.",5,5/27/2022
"This is maybe the best hotel I have ever stayed in my 25 years of life.  Singapore should be proud of this hotel.  Eventough I only stay for a night, but I have tried every facility of this hotel.  The room, pool, restaurant and bar was so mesmerizing..  The room and bathroom was so good and clen.  I love the ambience of pool, i can see all of singapore city from the rooftop pool.  The staff soo friendly and helpful.  Everything was so perfect!  I want to stay it again for a long time but for me it was to pricey :(  But i really love this hotel!!!",5,5/28/2022
"I recently returned from a 5 night stay here and the entire experience was simply amazing. Checkin was super fast and efficient, and the concierge was happy to provide me with a high floor room and later checkout on request. Room was spotlessly cleaned daily, with water bottles, toiletries and plenty of towels replenished. The hotel complex itself is massive!! Endless high end designer stores,retail stores, food courts, casino and direct access to the MRT train system. You can also take a gondola ride if you're feeling a bit lazy. Service was faultless throughout and there was always a member of staff available to assist with queries and direction. I managed to spend quite a bit of time relaxing in the infinity pool which is something you have to experience. The city skyline…",5,5/29/2022
"I had 3 rooms booked (since May 2014) for 30th October 2014 to have a special treat for the family to complete a fantastic family holiday which we had in Phuket.  We arrived at Marina Bay Sands at approx.6.45pm -7pm . Yes, the main reason for our stay was for everyone to experience the Skypark especially swimming at night. ( My husband and I had stayed previously).  When the booking was made it was specified we needed rooms to accommodate 2 adults + 2 childrens,  3 adults and 2 adults. ( hence 3 rooms booked.) Upon booking in, there were no long queues and again I had to clarify the breakup of people in each room. Rooms were allocated - excitedly we planned to quickly refresh, have dinner and then of course go to the skypark before 11pm for the special night swim (this was to be…",3,5/30/2022
"Simply amazing location, great transport options, well appointed.  Singapore's mass rapid transport is world class - clean, fast and efficient - with some great shopping (and authentic food) and possibly one of the fastest char kwai teou you will ever see cooked, and for  $4 - everything's only minutes away, as the Marina Bay Sands sits right atop the station.  There's a 7/11 downstairs if you need supplies, and every luxury shop you could think of, located within the ""Shoppes""  * You must have your passport with you if you want to get into the casino.  And then there's the ultimate infinity pool and a great little nightclub right there on the roof - P.S if you want too play in the nightclub, bring plenty of $$.   Overall - totally awesome experience.",5,5/31/2022

We had the most amazing young lady who upgraded our room because it was my birthday. To our cleaner in our room who did an exceptional job. Alway's replenishing our towel's & keeping our room clean & beautiful. Also putting little rose petals & creating little animals with the towels. The staff around the pool were also great and all the ladies in the infinity pool cafe. There was one lady there who made me a lemon/honey tea due to myself having a sore throat. Breakfast was the best we have ever had, yummy omelettes. Concierge staff also great with money changing & any questions we got answered. Fantastic to get a late check out & check out staff also top…",5,6/2/2022
"Okay so, hands up, I'm not a 5* (or 7* or whatever) hotel sort of a person.  I simply don't understand why i would pay $$$ for a bed when the same thing costs $ elsewhere.    So why on earth did we stay here, you ask?  Well, for the Sky Park and the pool of course.  We stayed here for one night (keep an eye on bookings.com, they do good room rates periodically).  We'd also had, in the previous few days, afternoon tea at the Fullerton and Singapore Slings in Raffles' Long Bar - in both the service was excellent.  But don't expect that at Marina Bay Sands.  The hotel foyer is chaotic - somebody else here describes it as like a railway station, and that's not a bad description.  Check-in is also chaotic - there simply aren't enough staff or desks to deal with the volume of people,…",4,6/3/2022
"Stayed here for a conference at the Sands Convention Centre.   Rooms comfortable and a photo taken in the swimming pool is a must for the album. What you would expect from a 5 star hotel with one exception.  For in tea/coffe in the room they provide powdered coffee creamer - no longlife or fresh milk.  How can a hotel of this standard not provide proper milk?  Very disappointed. Otherwise very large hotel with casino, shopping mall and casino attached.",4,6/4/2022
"Had the opportunity to put up a night at the hotel this week (for a night) while attending a business award ceremony held at the ballroom. The room is actually quite spacious, especially the bathroom, and I would rate it as comfortable. Check-In was a breeze despite the throngs of people in the lobby area which stretches from Tower 1 to Tower 3. Despite staying at a low floor (Level 5) at Tower 1, the room was quiet. I am mentioning this because some of my associates have commented that lower floor rooms facing the ""expressway"" tends to be noisy. My personal experience was OK and I consider myself a light sleeper.  Marina Bay Sands is a good hotel to stay in and it possess a good environment for those who are on holiday. High-end shopping is plentiful and for those who prefer to…",4,6/5/2022
"I booked the MBS because I wanted the rooftop-pool experience. But never in my life have I stayed at a hotel this big. And I was seriously concerned that the experience would be somewhat like spending a night in a busy airport terminal. This is also why I chose to book a club room...just to get away from the anticipated crowds.  Well...as you walk into the lobby of the MBS, it is somewhat like an airport terminal...a huge indoor space with people swarming all over.  The wait at check-in was quite long, but my patience was rewarded with the fact that my room was ready two hours ahead of the official check-in time. And the experience improved from then on. Because once you get into the elevator and away from the busy lobby, it does not feel like you are staying at a hotel with…",4,6/6/2022
"Stayed here for 2 days last month. The design of the hotel with its 3 towers and the 'ironing board' at the top is amazing. The rooms were modern clean well appointed and a good size. We had a bay view on the 42nd floor and the view day and night was amazing. The main attraction is of course the Skypark pool area, this did not disappoint it is a great pool again beautifully designed and with stunning views of the city skyline. The only thing I would say and it is not the only hotel in Singapore that I found this is a lack of umbrellas on the loungers and lack of shaded area. We had breakfast one morning at the Sky infinity which would have been nice but for a very rushed almost to the point of rude service and then another morning at the Alfresco cafe which was lovely. We had…",5,6/7/2022

I visited here as a family trip and we wasn't meant to stay in this hotel with the tour guide. But I'm glad we did.....The breakfast was 5* freshly cooked and live cooking stations... I pretty much ate myself back to sleep.   The roof top view was just out of this world with a pool that is just an eye opener. Although Singapore is still developing the scenery was beautiful.... hands down the top notch hotel there ,5,6/9/2022
The moment you enter the lobby it feels like you are entering the railway station with no proper arrangement for the guest. House keeping staff is good view is also good but you don't feel like you are staying in a Best property of Singapore...... :-(,3,6/10/2022
Most photographed building and.probably the biggest venue for conferences and conventions now in Singapore. Everyone wants to take a peek of this hotel because of its unique design. MBS has its infinity swimming pool and Ku de ta bar on the 51st floor. Fantastic view up there. Was also lucky to have the view of Gardens by the Bay in my room!,4,6/11/2022
Stayed here for the f1. Awesome.  Very pricey but the pool and view to gardens by the Bay was great.  Having the shopping mall and mrt so close was awesome as well.   Central as well and taxis were dirt cheap,5,6/12/2022
Spectacular location but the hotel faces inwards rather outwards. Collection of international names but could be in any city or location. Exception for me was the Dragonfly bridge that connected with Gardens by the Bay (surreal tree structures and gardens). Pool deck ontop of structure may be worthwhile but unable to access during GP. Luxury hotel but felt shallow,3,6/13/2022
"As a treat for my wife's birthday I arranged for my family to stay here for a couple of nights before we returned to UK. So I ordered two premier rooms with garden views one for my wife and I and one for my two sons. We arrived from Borneo that morning at the hotel around mid day and of course we had hoped to check in early but was told that the rooms will not be ready until the allowed check in time of 3.00 pm. But they gave us a free pass to the sky park and they have a lounge right beside the reception area for waiting guests offering free hot drinks and water, which was nice. We had a look round and came back at 3.00pm to go to our rooms only to find that our room was ready but my sons room would be about another half hour.

Yep. raw sewage in the bathroom.  In another tower, at the same time our friends bathroom flooded out too. See my user pictures for proof.

You cant miss out on seeing that building that you have seen in photos.  We take visitors on a boat down the river from Robertson Quay and finish at Marina Bay Sands.  Along the way you see a whole lot of sights and then get to see an extraordinary architectural feat.  The Shoppes are worth a look because of their opulence but you dont have to buy anything.  Go down to the basement food court for reasonably priced  food. Or have a coffee in one of the cafes and just people watch for a while in the nice air conditioning.  It is a nice respite from the heat.  If you want to go up the top to the lookout it costs $20. Better to go to top floor bar which is outside and you can get a great cocktail for $23 and same view as observation deck. Beers are cheaper.   They have a great light…,4,6/17/2022
"After my first visit to Singapore I said I would love to stay in the Marina Bay Sands if I ever visited again. As luck would have it I managed to visit again on my way back from Bali and booked into the hotel for three nights. If I'm honest it wasn't as nice as what I thought it was going to be, the hotel rooms are lovely and very clean but I just felt for the amount it costs to stay in the hotel the staff were not bothered about the customers it felt very impersonal. The best parts of the hotel has to be the infinity pool, if you can get up early (7am) and go for a swim it's well worth it before it starts getting busy at around 8am and the food hall downstairs. We had some great meals and they are very reasonably priced. Overall I wouldn't stay at this hotel again but to say…",4,6/18/2022
Attended a global conference for over 1200 people - so it seems this was the only venue that could supply enough accommodation so close to a large conference hall.  My room was on the 32nd floor of Tower 3 and it was fantastic - the decor was great and the finishing was classy. The pool was just spectacular and I enjoyed it a few times but only at night. It got very busy up there and is the place to be after hours enjoying a drink whilst looking at mesmerizing view. Is on the pricey side and probably would not have stayed there if work hadn't been paying but at any case it is worth a visit and there is a full shopping mall adjacent to this hotel.,4,6/19/2022

The hotel rooms are stunning we had a Premier room with city views and it was gorgeous. Amazing floor to ceiling windows with awesome views of the city. Size of room was large - definitely enough for the four of us. we requested a sofa that turned into a bed and got this - perfect for the kids thanks! The skypark is breathtakingly beautiful.

My wife and I stayed for only two nights en-route to Sydney and the Marina Bay Sands was therefore the 'must do' hotel of choice.  The entrance way and lobby areas are stunning and seemingly always busy. The rooms were nice and spacious; we opted for a deluxe room with city views and the views, especially at night were stunning whilst also providing a magnificent vantage point for the twice nightly light-show.  The Skypark and infinity pool were great and the real unique feature of the hotel.

I was told by some locals that you could pay to go up & swim in the infinity pool, but didn't see any evidence of this. I bought the photo as for once I looked ok. But paid big $$$ for it ($50).

The room was of good quality and bed very comfortable. Our room faced the gardens and the lights were very pretty at night.

Arriving the hotel on a Monday afternoon, I had to queue up for 25min to check in.

This place is not cheap, and the rates we got were not even considered high (S$380/night incl. tax and charge). So obviously you will have high expectations.  Staff were nice and attentive but it puzzled me when a hotel of this size would have only three counters open for check-in and check-out? Invariably there was always a line.

Would be great if the pool was heated too. Service was great, all the requests were attended to promptly, with a large baby cot for our bub and a mini cake to celebrate the special occasion. Rooms are huge and clean and i loooovee the bathroom! Front desk also great (think her name was Miki?), very polite and warm,  really made us feel welcome. The only thing i thought it lacked was halal food options in the hotel! What a pity, had to go over to MBS for food. Other than that, loved the stay and hope to be back soon! :)",4,7/11/2022
"As my little , 1and half year daughter said when she saw the city view "" wow wow wow !! "". what a place to stay in, To sleep in and to have such a beautiful view in.   This hotel is one of the hotels that you want to just stay in and enjoy it!   We enjoyed the beautiful pool on the roof .. This hotel is a MUST if you're visiting Singapore for the first time.   I recommend it for all types of visitors.",5,7/12/2022
"Hello!  A friend and I re-visited Singapore for 5 days in early November 2014.  We bit the bullet for $705AUD ($785SGD) for our last nights' stay in a Club Room.  We considered this to be the ""main attraction' of our Singapore visit, like going to Universal Studios and getting the Express ticket!  For anyone considering this, the only way to justify paying this much is to take advantage of the FULL MBS experience - this means not leaving MBS from check in to check out and using all the services available. The service you get here will be comparable to any other 5star but you pay the price for the infinity pool and the reputation.    We arrived at 10:30am and check in queues in the main lobby was very long. A hostess soon escorted us to the VIP check in foyer which fast tracked…",4,7/13/2022
We visited the marina to see the dragon spurting out the fountain of water from its mouth the went up to the 57 floor bar ku de ta views were amazing this is also a night club at night it's in the marina sands hotel well worth a visit as it has a casino as we'll but you must take you're passport to get in,5,7/14/2022
"I stayed at the MBS Singapore in September 2014 for work.  I wouldn't need to talk much since the numerous reviews. I shall highlight the best of this stay at the MBS.  - service: compared to an earlier visit years ago, this hotel's service appeared to have improved. The check-in process was prompt and orderly. - in-room dining: The food was okay. They delivered as what was promised so kudos to that. - Gym: The views from the gym is probably one of the best ever. Having a run and watching the city skyline is not an everyday experience, unless you are staying in MBS everyday. - Infinity Pool: It is a large pool broken up into three parts or so. It is a pool not for swimming but everyone just gets into it to soak the water, splash some water. So if one is an avid or serious…",5,7/15/2022
"What can I say, as you approach the hotel, you look up and are completely gobsmacked, the awesome sight in front of you is so impressive you can hardly stop looking at it, we walked into the check in reception, and was immediately whisked away to the VIP check in, we arrived early and they did their best to accommodate us as we had a lunch date at raffles hotel. The room was beautiful, tastefully decorated, lots of room, and the best mini bar I ever did see, even though it was the most expensive to, but you even had a drawer that was full of every glass you may have needed for them drinks, the bathroom was lovely, and full of great toiletries, everything that you needed. The bed was the most comfortable I ever slept in, and I couldn't wait to sleep. we had a park view, and what…",5,7/16/2022
"The Marina Bay Sands has become one of those places that people like to have on their 'been their list', and whilst it is a stunning building I am afraid that my impression was that it falls short of being a great 5* hotel. Whilst ours service at the front desk was good we meet other who had to wait over 30 minutes to check-in, there are some beautiful bits of artwork on display but if you use the washrooms they have manual taps, and although you cannot fault the view from the SkyPark the pool was crowded and there were people in the pool in their clothes. I will not be rushing back.",3,7/17/2022
"We planned a one night stay here at the end of our stay in Singapore purely because it was a hotel on our bucket list.  This hotel is huge! We had to check in at Tower 3 but ended up in Tower 2 because we got lost! Check in was remarkably easy, the gentleman who checked us in was very pleasant and asked us lots of questions about our stay in Singapore. As this was our first stay at the hotel, he upgraded us to the next room type  up from ours free of charge.  The room was fabulous, huge bed and lots of space. The bathroom was probably as big as my lounge and had a free standing bath, his and hers sinks, toilet and shower cubicle. The room had a balcony and overlooked the south china sea. We were able to watch the light show on the super trees from our room before we went out. …",4,7/18/2022
"An amazing hotelgiving the best views over the financial district in Singapore.The rooms are of a good size and very comfortable.The infinity pool on the top flooris absolutely incredible,taking a bit of nerve to swim to the edge.The restaurant on the top floor has some of the best views of the city",5,7/19/2022
"The view is amazing the swimming pool fabulous. I would definitely stay there again. The prices are a little bit high and the services not the greatest in the world, even though there are very good, but I assume the expectations are just enormous.  You just can get enough of the view and of the pool itself! We visited Singapore far more less than we have expected too, as we stood almost the entire days at the pool.  If you are lucky to also get a room with a fabulous view, than everything should be just great",5,7/20/2022
"If you want to experience the best view in your life. so, definitely you should reach at this hotel and get stunned by watching that outer view and its interior. Room service is fast and location is best.",5,7/21/2022
Stunning is the word for it.Casinos with all the shopping outlets fill the lower floors of the mall and the top floor infinity pool is in itself worth a major attraction.,5,7/22/2022
"The infinity pool is really fantastic.  The staff are all very professional, helpful and very very polite. For me and my husband  was the second time that we stay at the Marina Bay and May will not be the last...we hope to come back with our son and his girlfriend, very soon!!!!",5,7/23/2022
"Had a great stay at Marina Bay Sands. Stayed here for two nights at the end of a six-week European holiday and got to relax and enjoy the pool. Staff were lovely, room was huge and view was amazing. Can't wait to go back. Ku de Ta was a great night out as well.",4,7/24/2022
"Rated as a 5 or maybe even 6 star hotel, I would expect that the check-in would be smooth. However, to our dismay, checking into the hotel already took us an hour. Lobby was huge and super crowded but the check in counters and staff are insufficient for such huge crowds/ huge batches of tourists.  My husband and I decided to spend our wedding anniversary at MBS but turns out to be a little disappointed. At our 2nd, which is also our last night stay, there was a blackout just when we were about to turn in. We tried calling the concierge umpteen times but to no avail. My husband had no choice but to make a trip down to the lobby to check it out but half way through, the electricity came back. Not sure if the hotel is aware of the temporary black out as there were no calls to our…",3,7/25/2022
"We decided to book our last night here, stay, relax and just enjoy the amenities. We had so much fun since MBS is inter connected to shops, mall and even the MRT. We enjoyed swimming in the infinity pool.",5,7/26/2022
If you go to singapore you should visit marine bay and you should go to sky bar it s amazing. View s fantastic priceses re not too expensive. There s a shopping mall under the hotel and if you wanna buy something you can just go downstairs. Also you must visit casino vooovvvv amazing. ,5,7/27/2022
A stunning piece of architecture.  Like no building I have ever seen. You have to go to the Skypark (deck 56 floors up) as the view is just amazing and incredible at night. Fabulous shopping malls below. Gardens By The Bay right next door.,5,7/28/2022
Best hotel i have seen in the world. The swiming pool is awesome. You have to visit marina bay sands not singapore. The hotel is better than singapore. Awesome view from room and no words for the swiming pool. The rooms are very beautiful and very good designed.,5,7/29/2022
"If you can afford paying more than 300 euro per one night it is a must. The hotel is amazing, incredible building in a beautiful place. It is the only way to have a swim at the infinity pool, which itself it is the nicest visit in Singapore. Pricy?? Yes, but it worths having a swim with Singapore under your feet",5,7/30/2022
"Whilst it's very American in feel, and consequently not our normal first choice, we decided on a few days at MBS. Our suite was beautiful. Massive rooms, glass wall offering a spectacular view of the city, spotlessly clean, but a coffee machine rather oddly positioned with nowhere to plug it in. Breakfasts on the 'roof' were excellent and the infinity pool spectacular. My only gripe, if you can call it that, was that as we'd booked a suite we were moved from the ordinary check in queue, where there were 3 people in front of us, to the executive check in, where the whole world was in front of us.",4,7/31/2022
"You come here to have your YOLO moment and that's exactly what we did. Ever since I laid eyes on the infinity pool at MBS I knew that when we went to Singapore we had to stay here. The views are impeccable, with the city on one side and the bay on the other side. Of course we spent our days at the pool, although overcast, still provided us with endless entertainment with, ""OMGI I'm falling!"" pictures. This hotel is a resort since it is self-contained with plenty of eateries, shops and a casino. We had plenty of meals in that mall just a few steps away! A couple of small negatives was that the rooms, although nice, were a bit plain. I've stayed in nicer hotel rooms in Vegas that have automatic everything and all the bells and whistles. For the price you pay you expect to be blown…",4,8/1/2022
"When you are in Singapore, this landmark is a must go to. Take at least two nights! Then you have time to enjoy the rooftop pool and all the other amenities the hotel has to offer. We had our 6month old baby with us. They have a separate pool for kids/babys so there is fun for everyone. We had a city view room but I would take the garden view for sure next time. Reasons: City view has windows only and they are not always washed! Garden view rooms have balcony and also a superb view! You can enjoy city view from the rooftop pool with you champagne :)",5,8/2/2022
"The best hotel for travelers seeking class, luxury and expensive comfort. The place is a treat to the eyes. Though the casino was boring. The mall has excellent shopping brands to choose from. The swimming area with the infini pool was awesome.",5,8/3/2022
"Personally I am not a fan of megalithic hotels although having said that, there are aspects to the Marina Bay Sands which are impressive. The room sizes are excellent, the views are spectacular, the roof top infinity pool is swimmingly attractive and the overall service standards I experienced we're truly excellent, especially for such a huge property. But and with hotels this size there is always a BUT, some of the staff I encountered need further training, although they were helpful; my room was not cleaned until 1700 on two consecutive days....when I complained and asked for it to be cleaned before noon, it was done so for the rest of my stay. Signage within the hotel, especially for some of their featured restaurants which are located in the adjacent shopping mall are poor…",4,8/4/2022
"We are a family of 2 adults & 2 teenagers.  Singapore is a very safe city to visit and stop over in on your travels through Asia or to and from Europe, one of our favorite places.  Lots of tucked away things to do.  The MBS is the latest in what could be called a 'Statement' 5 Star Hotel.  You of course have the science centre just across the road which is linked.  Visiting both will be an all day affair, if you have time left and like a walk you can walk across the causeway to the giant Ferris wheel which takes about 30 to 40 minutes for a rotation.  The view is spectacular.  Its a 15 minute walk from the MBS's. Light refreshments are available on ground as are the Singapore double deck bus tours, as this is one of their staging points. We did it all.  The hotel is one of a…",4,8/5/2022
"Such a shame that this iconic hotel didn't deliver a 5* experience expected.  Check in was so slow, despite no queue. There was no communication from the receptionist to inform me why... And after 10 minutes, I was told he was looking for the best room for me, but the delay felt like there wasn't a room for me. At this point there was no introduction on breakfast options, where to take the lift or other hotel facilities eg wifi/gym.   Room smelt of stale cigarettes despite being a non smoking room. Changed room and 'upgraded' to a room which was dark. The rooms are dull and unimaginative which is a shame because from the outside the hotel had potential.  The next day I got back to my room which hadn't been cleaned. It was like it was left off the list. Not impressed.  Food makes…",4,8/6/2022

"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands in December 2013 around Christmas. From the check in point, staff were really helpful. We were waiting in a long queue about 10 seconds and the staff introduced us to go the other reception where we didn't have to wait at all.  We were staying at Premier room that has a nice bath tub and views looking over Gardens by the Bay. Staff who brought our bags was also helpful in that he kindly explained what things we can do around the bay.  Breakfast was good with a range of selection (Western, Asian and Indian) though it could get quite crowded in the mornings. Thought it would be nice if food could be categorised as vegetarian or not.  The pool at the top of the building was the highlight of this stay. Somehow the pool was not full whenever we visited…",5,8/8/2022
I stayed here for one night. It was very clean and modern. I enjoyed the Sky Pool and casino. While rather expensive it has all the services one would expect for such a price. The only issue I had was waiting to check-in took some time. The buffet was also rather expensive for what it was.,4,8/9/2022
"Great hotel. My previous visit was about 2 years ago for part of my honeymoon, and it's just as amazing as I remember, maybe even better. The location, service and facilities are just excellent. The views are very nice whether it's bay view or the park view. ",5,8/10/2022
"The Marina Bay Sands is as iconic to the Singapore skyline as the Harbour Bridge and Opera House are to Sydney, the PETRONAS Twin Towers to KL, Big Ben to London...you get the picture! An amazing feat in architectural and engineering excellence that is one of the very few examples of modern architecture that I like. The check in was smooth and the suite we were allotted....WOW!!! I can not speak highly enough of how large and beautiful it was! The rooftop pool is incredible and the large shopping centre across the street is a bonus for those of you who have a wife like mine who loves to shop! All up, you must stay in this marvellous hotel at least once in your life.",5,8/11/2022
"We recently stayed at the MBS in Singapore.  Quite apart from being currently the world's most expensive building complex ($4.2Billion) the experience was great from beginning to end.  Gor upgraded to a Club room on Level 41 of centre tower. Not good if you suffer from vertigo as the gals slopes outwards  but fantastic if you like heights, which we certainly do.  Rooms large, bathrooms brilliant but frankly the whole point of staying here is the SkyPark and the infinity pool. It is 57 floors up and it is a resort in the sky. Perched on top of the three hotel towers it is really a modern wonder of the world.  Restaurants, gradens, pool, cafes the lot. Not too crowded as only hotel guests allowed and, as in the whole hotel, service and customer care were brilliant.  It is worth…",5,8/12/2022
"We just stayed for 2 nights, It was expensive. But just to go to the pool it is worth it every dime. Yes, the queue line at check in is long, but we were done in 15 minutes. The hotel and its hall are huge, and you will have to walk and take elevators a lot to move from your room to anywhere. But the rooms and services are what you expect from that kind of money. Expect to pay upwards of $18-20 for basic cocktails. Again, you do not mind about it with that view from the top. The adjacent Shoppes at Marina Bay are also spectacular, although I did not dare venture into any of the stores for fear of having cardiac arrest with the prices. But in the whole It had to be done if you go to Singapore for the first time. You do not even have to go to the flyer once you see the view from…",5,8/13/2022
"Stayed 4 days last week during the ITB Asia event.   I have plenty to say, which is a summary from what I wrote in the guest survey.   COACH BAY Pro: Tower 1 basement, near to check-in area. Con: Dim and crowded. No sitting area, and everyone stands around with their piles of luggages making movements across the area (from hotel to convention centre) a nightmare.   ROOM:  Pro: Bed is ok. Room size is ok.  Con: Nothing great. Actually, below expectations. No bathtub. Lousy in-room wifi (lobby wifi is stronger in my 2nd floor room).Lousy room airconditioning (still warm at the lowest 18-deg), no refills of shower amenities but toothbrush was changed everyday. Automated billing minibar and to request for a fridge will set you back S$10.  Tower 3 2nd floor rooms are actually at…",3,8/14/2022

Long que at check in is not surpirse or even breakfast, yes this is more than a thousand rooms hotel. Even this hotel is always busy but I do appreciate their maintenance, room, public area, they keep everything look new! View from the room is wonderful looking the ocean where you can see traffic of ships. Pool is fantastic but it looks smaller than the pictures and it is crowd. Breakfast selection is great from western to asian. I love their Chinese breakfast.

"We checked into the hotel really just to have a swim in the famous pool overlooking the Grand Singapore Skyline - it did not dissapoint.  The hotel is lovely, rooms are spacious, extremely well equipped and comfortable - but then you would expect this from any five star hotel.  The highlight of this hotel is without doubt the wonderful pool - however, this hotel is far from delivering consistent value for money: No turndown service, limited breakfast options and a very long wait to check in.  However, having said all that, a dip in the pool makes it all worthwhile.  If you planning a trip to Singapore and have a few days, this is definitely a must (for a night anyway).",4,8/16/2022
"Pool and the views from the sky deck are amazing, but thats about it. Be advised - even with a large amount of lounge chairs, pool area will be crowded and hardly any seats left. Arrive early to claim a lounge chair and leave your stuff there all day to hold your place. Seems to be what all the guests do.  Staff were friendly, courteous and tried, but clearly the place is in need of help.  Check in took 30 mins. At their Venetian property its done in 5 minutes. Here the layout is terrible and the line snakes around the lobby. Staff try hard, but again the whole process is inefficient. Similar waiting time for checkout.  Breakfast time it is the same issue. Huge crowds, and in general to be avoided.  Rooms are not bad, but have a tired look.  I wanted to go to the casino, but the…",2,8/17/2022

"We were lucky enough to stay at MBS for 2 nights at the end of our Far East tour. Checking in at 9am, we were not surprised that our rooms weren't ready...however, what a way to while away the time at the Skypark! Super views and it wasn't crowded at all. Excellent food on the Skypark for lunch and Rise buffet was superb, both for breakfast and dinner on the ground floor. Sipping our Singapore Slings overlooking the city below was epic! Rooms were huge on the 38th floor and a city view was perfect as we watched the laser show from our floor to ceiling window. I'm still not sure if I should describe the building as beautiful or a monstrosity as it dominates the skyline in Singapore. Don't think twice about staying there, how can you go to Singapore and not experience MBS?",5,8/21/2022

On our last visit to MBS we were able to book a fantastic club room which had 2 double beds but on booking this year we were told that the hotel no longer did rooms for 3, we either had to book another room or have a put you up bed in our room.  We opted for the put you up bed which my daughter slept on.  I felt this was really poor given that the room we had was again a Club room and on the same level as before.  Our room was massive but appeared even larger as they had got rid of the 2nd double bed – it made the room look as if someone had stolen the furniture!!    That said, the room was lovely and…",4,8/24/2022
"The Marina Bay Sands hotel experience can be summarised with a terrible metaphor I thought of while looking at my suite’s room service menu and spotted mi goreng on there priced at S$28. It’s probably pretty good mi goreng, and I’m sure the presentation would be exquisite — but it is really worth it? Probably not. Same with the Marina Bay Sands (MBS).  I stayed in the Orchid Suite at the MBS for three nights while I was on a quick vacation in Singapore, and while I was definitely amazed with the incredible architecture of the building, that’s about as far as my amazement went. If you want a high society personalised experience, or you are used to boutique hotels, regardless of how much you pay the MBS will *not* deliver. You most definitely feel like a sheep in the pack at the…",3,8/25/2022

"We stayed on 5th floor. There are only 3 lifts to the floor and sometimes we have to wait more than 10minutes just to go down.  The infinity pool was nice, we enjoyed the swim. It's good that only hotel guest can access the pool, they have strict policy to check the room keycard and each card is only 1 adult.  We stayed in Premium room but it was not like what we expected. Maybe because of the lower floor room, we only get the view of the shopping centre opposite us and no nice view at all. The carpet was stained and the bed was facing the window and not facing the tv.  Staff was friendly.

The infinity pool was spectacular and breathtaking, and it is packed and there are so many freaking kids! I though this was a very nice hotel for adults, I didn't expect to be surrounding by children running, screaming, crying, splashing and swimming from every direction. It was the best birth control I could imagine!  The room itself was spectacular, huge ceilings, windows, very spacious, wonderful bathroom and bathtub - just not for $700 a night.  Maybe next time we'll upgrade to the $17,000/night Chairman Suite and hopefully get our own  private infinity pool to avoid ALL THE PEOPLE AND KIDS!",4,8/31/2022
well this is one hotel where you can easily get lost quite regularly.....this just doesn't seem to finish and i was amazed how do they manage a property of this scale..it took 10-15 minutes after we checked in to just find our room.....the best part is the infinity pool with an amazing view of the merlion down below and a commanding view of the singapore skyline....one can spend quite a few hours there....God knows how many restaurants this property has but we only managed to have food at only one of them which was the Punjab Grill by Jiggs Kalra and the food there was amazing..... insanely big property,4,9/1/2022

"The hotel is one of the iconic places in Singapore due to design ,casino ,breathtaking views and the infinity pool at the 57th floor . We stayed at the 53rd floor with the city view , the view from here is breath taking . The hotel rooms are very big compared to other hotels of similar standard . The swimming pool @ 57th floor is always crowded and cannot accommodate the entire guests  . Plenty of restaurants to dine in the mall in front of the hotel , hotel  connected to metro station . Even though the rooms are very comfortable it lacks  richness - may be due to the quality of furnishing . The staff is also friendly  .

We had a stop over in Singapore and decided to take this opportunity to visit the city and stay for 2 nights. Therefore what more fantastic than this incredible hotel? The Marina Bay is impressive by all means. We had booked 2 connecting rooms in tower no3 one with a king bed very large room with dressing and the second room had 2 queen beds for our kids. But of course the most amazing part of this hotel is definitely their Skyparc with this infinity pool absolutely fantastic. For us it was once in a lifetime experience as we probably will not visit anytime soon this part of the world so we decided to make the most of it by choosing this hotel and we do not regret our choice! The only shock was at check-out on the bill they charged us SG$ 8.97 for the in-room coffee which means…,5,9/4/2022

Then several things did not work out like too noisy due to being only at the 6th floor and the highway, keys did not work, and coffeemachine did not work properly. We complained and got a really nice room. The skypark is amazing with the swimming pool and the view. All is fine but the hotel is just very big and unpersonal.

The pool is to die for and quite stunning with awesome views ... night lights of the city are fabulous.  The location is fantastic and easy to get around the city.  Only reason the one star is deducted is that we are a family of 4 and the rooms (as we found out at check-in) are 2 king singles.  I had emailed the hotel before making a reservation and I was advised that the rooms could accommodate 2 adults and 2 children.  I then booked and requested that we be allocated two doubles - of which they said this could not be guaranteed - understandable.  A King Single is really not acceptable to sleep…",4,9/9/2022
"Marina Bay Sands touts itself as “the most spectacular hotel in Singapore” and, on that front, there is little argument that they are (check out their infinity pool on the 57th floor with spectacular views of the city)…  However, my three day stay there left a lot to be desired on the hygiene and service front, particularly when considering the $500+/night price tag.  In the middle of my first night staying there I went to the bathroom where I found a cockroach crawling around the bathroom counter, right next to my toothbrush… In the morning I went to the check in desk squished cockroach in hand (wrapped in toiled paper, of course) and asked to switch room (I assume they would be fumigating the room and certainly did not want to stay in a freshly sprayed room or have my stuff…",2,9/10/2022
"I highly recommend Marina Bay  Sands Hotel if you are going to be visiting Singapore, the extra cost of staying here is well worth the experience and memories you will take home with you. The infinity pool & rooftoop bars are amazing, they give a 360 view of the beautiful city which are absolutely breathtaking. If you love to shop, there is mall which offers luxury brands, cafes & even a canal running through the centre just to add a bit of Italian architecture. There are many more highlights to this hotel, you may just have to see for yourself ;) . I would definitely stay here again- without hesitation :)",5,9/11/2022
"Amazing structure, architecture. We were proud that the architect is a Canadain.would have liked to go to the top but costly at SGN 20.00 p/p",5,9/12/2022
"This place feel just like another normal hotel stay. The room I got is facing gardens by the bay, and the room is quite small compared to those I see in the photos. To get food, you need to walk quite a far bit out to the mall. This hotel just feels like a business transaction. ",3,9/13/2022
I have been here 3 times. This is an amazing place. Probably the best place to stay in South-East Asia. An early morning swim at the pool on 57th floor is a must have experience. you can checkin your luggage and take boarding card for Singapore airlines directly at the hotel itself. there are free ferries which take you from Hotel to Airport.,5,9/14/2022
"If you're going to Singapore, I myself can see no reason why you would not stay at this hotel. Yes, it's huge, yes, you likeley only meet some staff one, but that's about the only negative thing I can come up with. When we arrived at tower 1 we counted 23 staff whos only task it was to handle arriving/departing cars and guests. Our bags were taken care of before all four of us had even left the cab. Check in, was fast. A lot of staff, and almost no wait time. The time I spent waiting in line was used to just take in the amazing settings. Our room (premium twin bed, floor 28 facing the city) was great. Large bathroom, comfy beds.  We had breakfast included, and I read a few reviews that pointed out that those breakfasts was extremely crowded. Also when we arrived there was a note…",5,9/15/2022
"We had a truly memorable time at MBS. Such a great hotel. Easy to get to, we took the metro to Bayfront and the hotel is connected to the MRT via underground walkway and shops. Check in was quick and easy, and our room, wow! Huge room with a separate home theatre, large lounge area and view across Gardens by the Bay. We had Club access, and the evening drinks on Level 57 were super cool. The pool was stunning, both during the day and night, looking out onto the Singapore skyline. The staff were friendly and attentive. It's expensive, so we only stayed one night, but really enjoyable experience. Would love to stay again sometime.",5,9/16/2022
The marina bay sands one of the world best construction work.beautiful place also.casino locating below at hotel.                                 lot of people loved this place......   Near locating Singapore flyer....     room service is excellent... I give 7* speciality hotel grade......             they have good feature.......,5,9/17/2022
"I was greeted by a cheerful staff at the counter & that brightens up my day.  The hotel is clean and spacious with a wonderful bath tub. I should have booked with a city view/ garden view. The view is beautiful & breath taking.  It's a must to visit the infinity pool and observation deck. The view is awesome!! Refer to pictures. Overall, the experience was enjoyable & memorable.",4,9/18/2022
The roof top provides great view of the bay and the city. The chilled beer and warm winds added to the experience,4,9/19/2022
"Finally took the time to visit the MBS hotel complex. A quick ride from City Hall MRT to Marina Bay MRT, drops you in the underground mall area, below the hotel.  The mall area is extensive with multiple levels, a casino, and every type of retail store.  The hotel 'lobby' is large as there are 3 room towers spaced along the length of the ground floor.    There is an observation area that can be accessed by the public for a fee.  The view during the day was impressive.  A restaurant and bar (Ku De Ta) provides the same view at no add'l charge, other than the meal and drink.  The rest of the top deck is accessible to hotel guests only, including the hotel pool.",4,9/20/2022
"The hotel was very beautiful. We stayed on the eighteenth floor in the middle tower facing the Marina. the room was huge and even had a bath,can you imagine the view of Singapore from up   there, GREAT. The staff were fantastic and very helpful .The infinity pool at five thirty in the morning was really impressive . What a GREAT hotel.",5,9/21/2022
"You cant help but be amazed by the 3 skyscrapers of Marina Bay that have a boat straddling the top of them.  Looks beautiful from below.  Saying that, if you intend to go shopping in the mall there, make sure you have won the lottery first.  All designer European and US designer shops selling things for prices affordable only by the wealthy.  We didn't realise but apparently it's possible to get to the top - there is a bar/restaurant up there - I would recommend doing this.  I imagine the views would be spectacular.",4,9/22/2022
"We paid a lot of money to go to the top, was expecting a lot, but its not so great, you do get good view of Garden by the bay and the city but nothing too great. Maybe we went at night that why we didn't like it much. You can also get free entry in a bar which is located at the center of the roof but they won't let you go till the edge.",3,9/23/2022
This hotel is just fantastic. We stayed here for 5 nights in 2011. Everything at this hotel was perfect. If you have the chance enjoy a week here 😊 Many nice restaurants. Pool area is beyond belief and very relaxing.,5,9/24/2022
"My wife and I intended to stay for the first time at Marina Bay Sands just for one night following our business trip in Singapore. We simply wanted to explore Marina Bay Sands without any particular expectations.  We were however very impressed from the first step out of the taxi. Taxi stand is very well organized and staff were very attentive and efficient particularly staff at the reception who was a young and very pleasant girl. Sky pool is spectacular and it is something we ever experienced.  We really enjoyed like kids just went to Universal Studio.  We did have a great time and wished to had stayed longer. Definitely, we will be back again very soon.",5,9/25/2022
Me and my partner stayed here for 2 nights- can't stress enough how amazing this hotel is. Service was perfect and the food was 5star. Pool was amazing and views were outstanding. Only couple downsides were not many seats at pool available at certain times and breakfast was quite busy- but nothing to crazy. Enjoyable stay,5,9/26/2022
Amazing 5 star hotel. The pool is stunning.  Great restaurants and window shopping at the Marina.  We booked a baby sitter through the hotel so we could go out for dinner.  Kids had room service and watched a movie.  Also saw fireworks from the hotel and watched a laser show on the harbour.  We had a great time.,5,9/27/2022
"Checked in on 26 October in mind to celebrate our 1st year anniversary, was served by concierge staff Miki. Very polite and helpful staff constantly looking out for the occupants and ensuring that they will enjoy their stay. She's truly an asset to MBS. View from our clubroom with garden view was magnificent, night lightings at gardens by the bay was great and romantic as well. Room is clean, club services are professional and of good quality. Overall, our 1st anniversary was fulfilling and well spent here. ",5,9/28/2022
"We went with our kids ages 9 and 11.  The only reason I would go again is for the pool and the view.  The rooms are nice, good size, lovely bathroom.  However for this caliber of hotel I would of expected better in room coffee, extras such as toothpaste and more than 2 bath towels.  The pool is truly spectacular.  However, it was a bit dirty with wrappers etc floating by.  Nobody ever came by to offer a drink, but I did go up to order and they were brought right away.  There were lines at check in but a staff member noticed someone cut us so he ushered us right to the front.  Our bags were delivered to the room pretty quickly.  Overall a good experience but because of its size, there is no personal service and the cleanliness is not perfect.  But....go for the pool!",4,9/29/2022
"This motel was a once in a lifetime experience.  My husband & I stayed in a deluxe room on the 39th floor of tower 3, with views of the Gardens by the Bay. The room was spacious & clean. It provided all that we would need to stay there for the one night. Be aware of the mini bar fridge as it is charged when items are removed. So, if you take out a bottle to look at, then replace it without drinking it, you will be charged for that item. This information was provided by our check-in attendant, though our family staying in another room were not advised of this.  With our room facing the gardens & bay side, we were able to experience the Gardens by the Bay light & music show from our balcony. It was absolutely beautiful. Also the next morning provided an amazing sunrise over the…",4,9/30/2022
"By far the best hotel infrastructure  I have ever visited  but honestly  is too big   to have a personalized  attention,  lines for checkout  and concierge  service are looooong  but in any case the experience  was incredible  and unique   so the rest just needs a little  of improvement. ",4,10/1/2022
"I stayed here for WTA Finals last week and I agree with what most say about its facilities: AMAZING, especially its infinity pool.   The establishment itself is very big. Be prepared to walk. Do not stay here if one of your party have difficulties walking.   Room facilities are average in comparison to other new 5 stars hotels that I have visited. Nothing is free. They have a refrigerator that automatically bills you when you took out something, no matter if you actually consumed it or not. We made a mistake doing that, and kudos to the billing dept that they took out the charges when we noticed. So, do not bring too much perishable food, because you will not be able to keep them in the fridge.  The Shoppes (mall adjacent to the hotel) is also humongous. Everything is there,…",3,10/2/2022
"The rooftop pool alone is worth spending a few nights here. I also stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia when in Singapore and although the service and rooms were not as good, the Marina Bay Sands has something very few hotels in the world can beat and that is that rooftop. Don't get me wrong, the hotel was still fantastic and everything was above board. It was just that I was spoilt having just come from the Millenia.",4,10/3/2022
Mainly booked Marina for the infinity pool and it was well worth it. The rooms were big with very large bathrooms considering I booked the cheapest room available. Was able to check in an hour early and received some juice upon check in. Room was located on the 17th floor in tower 3 with view facing garden by the bay. ,4,10/4/2022
"Stayed here for one night in September with my husband.  Our first impressions were not great. We lined up in the check in line for about 15-20 mins. In this space of time, a check in attendant pulled people from the line who were behind us and took them to an express check in area. This happened with about 3-4 sets of people before I asked the staff member why these people were taken to an express area. His answer was I'm sorry and then he tried to get us to a check in asap. Not sure why there was preferential treatment to the people behind us in the line. 5 mins later we had an attendant check us in. We were in the line at 10.30am with the intention of leaving our bags with the hotels until after 2pm when we would check in. I think because I was irritated at waiting so long in…",4,10/5/2022
"it is the hotel to be for few days. The highlight is the 57th floor, amazing view for breakfast, dinner, parties and just a drink. The swimming is fantastic, a unique experience! But.....be ready to queue for everything, check in, check out (even more than 30 min. At peak times). The lobby is a touristic place and it is visited by groups and individuals......very crowded. Staff not enough for guests, not a personalized service, especially for this level of hotel. Rooms are very nice, quite big , light colors. Nice bath and shower , and also a small terrace. Better to order room service if you do not want to spend time in line for a seat, especially at breakfast. Recommended the 57th floor than the lobby level. But it is the hotel you have to stay....at least once!",4,10/6/2022
"This is my 5th time at the hotel and sadly with each visit, the quality of stay is less than the occasion before.  It is clear that maintenance and upkeep of the hotel has problems. I don't blame them, the building is colossal. The one room we had, had a very strange smell in the bathroom which they could not address. The tiles on the floor of the shower in the other room were warped and caused water to leak out into the bathroom.  The elevators were also a bit noisy upon opening and closing of the doors - not the mention very stuffy inside.  On the plus side, the pool is amazing and the view never gets old. They have also forced 1 room card per person at the Skypark which I feel made a big difference. It always used to get way too crowded. The hotel should also make this clear…",4,10/7/2022
"I stayed in this hotel for 5 days during last May 2014. The room was comfortable but quite impersonal for the price of accommodation. The positive points is the location of the hotel, the supper cool open pool on the roof top and the views from the rooms. Nevertheless there seems not to be enough staff as there is long waiting for everything: check-in, to be seated in a restaurant, room service, check-out.",2,10/8/2022
I would go again- Just go to the restaurant on 55th floor - Ak for a coffee-This way you get here for free    What an amazing place,5,10/9/2022
"i stayed in this hotel with my family (5 members) on August 2013. Not much to say, that i found this hotel is the best one i've ever stayed at, with huge swimming pool on the top of the building, good view from the room (my room was on 41st floor), nice room also, helpful staffs, and good location. The only problem that i found was in the fridge. i didn't have any idea about the price of the beverage in the fridge will be counted when replaced, even if we don't drink it! at that time, we confirmed to the hotel and they said it would be okay because they would do double check when i checked out. But on the next month, my credit card (used to open the status of the room) was billed around 70 SG$. This was so annoying, that we didn't take or use anything payable in the hotel, but…",5,10/10/2022
As I was relocating to USA I decided that I wanted to have my final night at MBS.  I wanted to take a swim in the pool on the 52 floor.  Many other guest have complained about the long check in lines.  I did not experience this and was waiting no more than 5 minutes.  I was also lucky as they upgraded m to a suite - I mentioned it was my last night in Singapore.  The room was magnificent with great views from Tower 1.  I found it a little hard to make way to top of hotel as you have to go to certain floors for cross over.  We had dinner in Ku De Ta which was also excellent - great service and enjoye the food immensley.,5,10/11/2022
"Marina Bay is total perfection if you seek relaxation on your holiday. The infinity pool has definitely got most of the guests stunned from 6am - 11pm. We didn't get bored going up to the pool again and again. Food were amazing. Room boy staff was really nice, I don't remember his name but I asked for his advice and he was so friendly and even gave more than we needed to know. Reception area is a little bit bad for us if you're not VIP. Staff speak so fast but so low-volume and it's not very comfy, not very 5 star for the check-in and check-out process for MBS. The room is just ok, if there's no view, there's nothing special. The mall in MBS is gigantic!! Casino is even more entertaining. Everything is exciting and amazing. Oh, and VERY FAST wifi!  Overall, we got our hearts…",5,10/12/2022
"There are many positives and a few negatives about the hotel and I suppose my negatives are based more on personal preferences.   The positives: The staff were generally good, especially in the club lounge on the 57th floor (breakfast service was better than the evening service – evening staff were mostly slow and unfriendly). The food and drinks offered were of a good quality, variety and standard, but no cocktails. Hence, I would recommend anyone who can afford the exorbitant price to give the club rooms a try, as breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks with canapés are included. The infinity pool on the 57th floor, looks great, but can get overcrowded at times and becomes more like a school swimming pool, definitely not serene. It is worth a quick dip and a few photos, as…",3,10/13/2022
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and had views over the Singapore Gardens by the bay. Great hotel, of course the outstanding feature is the rooftop pool which i felt was a bit cool (temperature). We happened to be there while they were practicing for the Singapore national day with the low fly over of the Singapore's air force. Easy to get around with the metro just across the street.",5,10/14/2022
"This Hotel is really nice. The shear size of it and the pool make it what it is though as they are out of this world. Definitely a tick off the bucket list in terms of visiting this hotel for it's pool. Only problem was the jacuzzi was pretty scolding and could be cooler. The pool aside, this hotel is just nice in terms of room quality. Nothing exceptional to warrant paying silly money for. Also the rooftop bar is a let down too, overpriced and underwhelming. I would recommend this just for it's pool but I would also only go if you get a deal, as paying over £200 a night is not worth it.",4,10/15/2022
"Had a family staycation at MBS in 1 of the club room on 3 Oct - 5 Oct.  Room was big and spacious with a beautiful view of the Gardens by The Bay. The room comes with a sofa bed which makes it perfect for my kids. The bathroom comes with a nice bathtub that lets you enjoy the view of the Marina Floating Platform if you intend to soak in the tub.  But the downside is that people along the corridor will be able to see you in the tub! So you will have to bring down the blind which defeats the whole purpose.    The pool at the Skypark is a MUST GO and MUST DO thing in Singapore.  Water is usually icy cold since it is high up.  But you get to enjoy spectacular view of Singapore's city skyline as you swim.  Standby your selfie stick!! :)  However, there is 1 thing which I need to…",5,10/16/2022
"Marina bay sands was literally fabulous for it's room size, hotel facilities like swimming pool, club lounge, shopping mall and the exterior of the hotel itself. The room and shopping mall was amazing. But service was not like a 5 star hotel. Employees of vip lounge seemed they don't care about giving sincere service to their guests. It might be because they were too busy to treat too many guests, but their businesslike cold attitude was unpleasant enough. I'm pretty satisfied enough to spend 1 night here, and also I would recommend this fabulous hotel in Singapore, but I have to say that 1 night is enough. The poor service cannot explain what they charge for.",3,10/17/2022
"We stayed at Tower 3 during our visit. The lobby area felt like a busy and frustrating transit center with a long line of people waiting at the porter stand + a long line of people at the check in /out stands + a cafe that nearly has no tables and chairs + can't find a sitting area at the lobby. My tired husband and my little boy sat down on the bare floor and waited for 15 minus for me to pick up the keys.  There is no concierge stand, so you need to wait in line with the transistors just to ask the porters a question.   The room was comfortable, and had lovely views over the Garden in the City and the bay. The balcony was spacious.  The bathroom was nice and new.  The roof top pool as nice but a bit  crowded. Drink services at the pool was good (speedy).  Iced water is…",4,10/18/2022

The location is great, there are cassinos, theater, park and shoppings around, besides the metro. The pool is some of the greatest i ever seen. Infinite border at the rooftop. Unique experience.

Room is huge with a nice view to the city. I am very happy with the room, but also the girl who checked me in.  She looks professional, polite and helpful. She works at tower 3 counter and unfortunately i forgot her name.  Another reason to stay is for the rooftop pool. Nice view overlooking the city. Good for taking pics. Luckily wasnt many people there. And i prefer day view more than the night view.  Overall, efficient checkin and checkout. Staff are mostly friendly. Pool is a must visit. Did not use any other facilities or the resraurants. Its worth paying so much money for staying.",5,10/21/2022
Hi I have booked an 3 nights trough an agent from india. While booking we have requested the management to do an early check in cuz my flight arrival was at 6AM Once i reached the hotel standing on the queue for an nearly half an hour then they say we can't do it so the rooms will be ready by noon only  My whole vacation mood has gone down i felt to catch a flight back to home. what a worst service if they can't organize early check in then they could have said no at the time of booking.

"I stayed here for two nights for a treat at the end of a holiday and what a wonderful two nights they were. Slight confusion upon arrival with someone trying to put our bags into storage (still no idea why) and issues with payment but a free upgrade compensated for that!  We had a room on the 47th floor with views over the gardens which was just stunning, day and night. Of course it's fantastic to also be able to go and look across the city, too. There was a thunderstorm one evening which made for some outstanding photos.   The room was big and clean with lots of amenities. My only criticism was that we could have had some room in the fridge for storing our own drinks instead of it being full from the mini bar.   Being able to go in the pool at night made for an unforgettable…",5,10/23/2022

"Huge hotel with dozens of shops, bars and restaurants to spend some time in before heading to the famous swimming pool on the 57th floor with the breathtaking view - worth every penny! Aim for the highest floor available or spend some extra bucks for a Club Room (from 45th floor upwards) - the view is truly amazing!",5,10/25/2022

The view from the room (45th floor) is outstanding! The service is very good and I even got a cake to my room because I had my Birthday. The hotel is huge, the lobby is too crowded and the infinity pool can be super busy with so many people you can't feel so much you are in so special hotel. The view from the pool is amaizing and worth the stay at this hotel. The hotel location is perfect. Below is the Marina gardens which are wonderful, especially at night when they are all illuminated.

We were so impressed and surprised when we arrived at the hotel as there were 2-3 staffs awaiting us at the lobby.Even we werent seemed as much as those VIP or business traveler, the service was still outstanding.

Great view and great swimming pool !  Checking in was relatively fast (though VIP check in was closed) and the receptionist really tried to allocate a nice room.

"There has already been plenty written about Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and my recent visit certainly met my expectations. The hotel is spectacular with the highlight being the Skypark  and infinity edge pool on level 57.  Only hotel guests or patrons of the restaurants can access the Skypark and room keys are required to gain access. The pool can be very crowded in the afternoon, but still remains a highlight of your stay at this hotel. The club lounge on level 57 serves a free breakfast to guests staying in club rooms as well as refreshments throughout the day. It is located overlooking the pool and is well worth the extra cost if stay at MBS. In summary, choose a club room or premier room with a balcony overlooking the beautiful Gardens by the Bay.

I held my wedding banquet at Marina Bay Sands and it was an unforgettable experience because it was much better than I expected. The service was impeccable and top notch. Here is why:  1. Coordinator Euphie was always quick to respond throughout the past 5 months whenever I had queries and changes. Up till to the last day when I had sudden increase in no. guests.   2. Provided me with a bridal changing room that is just opposite the ballroom so its easier for me to change my gowns and do my makeup- this was really useful. Bellboy also brought my things over here and there so we didn't even have to leave a finger.   3. Food was portioned and also brought to our changing room thus we did managed to have the full 8 course meal despite not being in the ballroom like the guests.   4.…,5,10/31/2022

The view across the city was spectacular, and the pool was incredible. Singapore is an expensive city, compared to other parts of Asia, but quality always comes at a price. At MBS you know what you are getting, so no regrets whatsoever. If you're wondering if you should stay there, just do it, and enjoy your stay.",5,11/1/2022
"We stayed last August 2014 with the whole family.  We enjoyed the Infinity pool though it gets crowded in the afternoon.  We had premiere room; it’s nice, same with any other luxury hotel except for its bar.  The rest room is huge but no bidet.  We love the spectacular view from our room. Queue for check in took a little time but check out was fast.  Some staff are friendly some are arrogant. Since we stayed with our 2 kids we were looking for other activities or area for them but found nothing.  Hope they can have more facilities for the kids to enjoy.   Good to have experience this once, the infinity pool is yes… amazing but the 5 star hotel experience is nothing compared with other 5 star hotels considering it’s price.",4,11/2/2022
"This is one of the WORST hotels I have ever been to (I blame the over-rated reviews of this hotel.)  To get to the point, I told the hotel 2 or 3 weeks in advance that TWIN-BED room is mandatory for my stay, and they replied that they noted my request. When I arrived for check-in, the agent said that only king-size bedrooms are available, and that all rooms are fully booked (what a bunch of crappy lies she told us!) We refused and insisted on a twin-bed room and that she would upgrade us to better room if they didn't have twin-bed room. After insisting that the hotel was fully booked we continued to argue with her until the supervisor came by. We asked the supervisor for a twin-bed room and he upgraded us from normal premier room to city-view premier room (despite all of this I…",1,11/3/2022
We stayed the first few nights of our honeymoon here as we favoured the rooftop pool over the old school elegance of Raffles. We had a beautiful room with views out over the gardens and had fabulous service most of the stay. Have access to the executive breakfast on the roof was lovely but we were too busy exploring Singapore to make use of the cocktail hour. The bar and club were excellent fun and worth a visit even if you're not staying there. One sour note was the buffet restaurant who were rather rude and kept challenging the voucher given as part of our stay. I had to try to produce email evidence. Not what you want on your honeymoon. Perhaps eat elsewhere. Aside from that it's well worth considering.,4,11/4/2022
"Service:  Had low expectations bec of the reviews but we personally experienced good service.  Not spectacular but not as awful as experienced by others.  As soon as we stepped out of the car, our luggage was cared for.  We arrived around 11am and was checked in immediately.  The receptionist also suggested that we take the room with the King bed bec it has a better view (36th floor).  Everything that we asked for was done.  Im not giving it a perfect 5 bec considering the hefty price tag you would expect to be treated like royalty.  Amenities:  Room was huge but the furnishings and beds are just the same with other 5-star hotels (cheaper ones).  But the view was spectacular!    Skypark:  Now I guess this was what we paid for.  Its wasnt too crowded when we visited but it surely…",4,11/5/2022
"We arrived at 8am for check in. Staff was very polite. Completed all the formalities and advise room will be available by 1pm, till then we can use swimming pool and other facilities. When rooms our ready he will give us a call. He also told us that MBS is open till 11 pm. We went for some sightseeing, he indeed did call us at 1pm. We returned and took our key cards.  Views from the room were mind-blowing. Everything was top-notch. After few minutes we received half of our bags. We waited 30 minutes, but did not receive rest. We had to remind them twice before we could get them.  Then we went to MBS to enjoy the day views and finally took dip into their infinity pool. I had heard so much about it, that this was the reason we paid such exorbitant price to stay here for a night.…",3,11/6/2022
"We booked to stay here as wanted to be able to visit the rooftop infinity pool which can only be accessed as a guest. The rooftop pool area and view really is a great experience and it is worth staying here for that. We stayed in a city view room and if you are staying in this hotel it really is worth paying the extra for that view as that really is the only reason to stay here - for the view of Singapore from the rooftop and the rooms! The room was huge with a lounge area, big bathroom and huge king bed, everything was really comfortable and the hotel amenities were also excellent - make sure you go to the gym - running on a running machine that high up with the view over the city is an experience I won't forget - make sure you don't look down though!!  The service at the hotel…",4,11/7/2022
"What can I say? THANK YOU FOR A GREAT MEMORY!  I stayed here with my woman and we really love this hotel and we will always remember this - a great hotel in a great city! And the staff was very friendly, nice and helpful too! We got a room at level 49 and our view over the city was really nice! I could not sleep in the night, I just sit in the sofa with a cup of coffee and watching the great skyline! Thank you Marina bay sands and the staff for a nice memory!",5,11/8/2022
"Given the reputation, I was expecting something magnificent.  What I found instead was a solid hotel, but below the level of its Vegas and Macau peers (e.g. Wynn, Cosmopolitan and LVS).  The room was large and had nice views, but was furnished in a way that made it feel half-finished.  Main walkways in the lobby were nice, but the way the restaurants and reception encroached on the space made it feel cheap.  The elevators were a nightmare with so much traffic to the sky garden that you often stopped at half the floors on your way up or down.  The sky garden is breathtaking, but overcrowded and finding seating can be a real burden.  Overall, I would stay one night just to see access the sky garden once, but then stay elsewhere for the remainder of the trip.",3,11/9/2022
"Arrived at hotel, went to check in, was charged to get an upgrade despite being a member. Got to our room to find what may have been food (hopefully it was food and not vomit) in the sink, dirty foot prints in the shower, cigarette ash on the painting in the bathroom and just general untidiness. Went down to reception to ask for a different room where I was basically called a liar by the first staff member I spoke to. The manager then stepped in, and I was told that the only room available had twin beds rather than the king I had not only paid a fortune for, but had been charged EXTRA for. This was a huge waste of money and I am left extremely disappointed by a hotel that is supposed to be of such high standard.",1,11/10/2022
"We stayed here as part of a month long trip to Asia. Drawn by the infinity pool we figured we needed at least one night here!  On the whole the stay was good. The room we stayed in faced the gardens and had a balcony. A large room with chaise longe, desk, and Queen size bed. We also had a freestanding bath and shower. Our room was near the middle so had excellent views, I believe the more expensive rooms get the higher floors.  We loved the sky park. Of course the infinity pool and its views are great, but the additions of being served drinks in the pool and having a photographer to help you take your pictures were big pluses.  It was fairly busy the first time we came (6-7pm) and at those times don't expect to do much actual swimming. However, you do get to see the city turn on…",4,11/11/2022
"I was in Marina bay Sands attending a conference. the location is perfect just across the street (with underground crozzing) of the exhibition, casino and shops. The room was fantastic, amenities abound and nice view of the Bay. Restaurants on the grund floor gives you options and you have in the shopping mall a douzen more. Breakfast is somehow expensive and crowded but you have options from chinese, international and indian food. The star of the hotel is the infinity pool on the terrace. Not only spacious, with a view but also children free in one side. Jacuzzi is also available at the terrace and it is reserved for guests. I did not find difficult to find a chair. I will return.",4,11/12/2022
"Marina bay sands with its imposing edifice & world renowned infinity pool is a major draw for tourists to pick as their preferred choice for accommodation while in Singapore but completely falls short of all expectations. We chose it to celebrate a family member's 60th b'day but right from check-in to check-out the entire experience felt cold, impersonal & indifferent. You feel that your up against an arrogant system that doesn't care to change. We checked-in at 5:30 way past the normal check-in time of 3 but were told that one of our rooms were not ready and that they could not provide us or guarantee one with a king bed. Imagine this from a hotel with 2500+ rooms!! The entire check-in procedure took us 1 hour while my entire family waited on a stone bench in the lobby!! On…",1,11/13/2022
We are Singaporean and we wanted to experience the Infinity pool. We checked in 18 Oct and out 19 Oct.  It was awesome !  Room. I wasn't expecting room to be so spacious. I didn't check the m2 though.   But ww had 2 double beds and one roll out bed and perfect for family of 4. Teabags were from TWG !   Toilet Big!  2 basins. 2 cubicles - one shower and one WC. Bath tub was nice and big too.  Bed and pillows Great.   Location  Central and well connected to public transport. Big shopping mall but mostly luxurious and upmarket merchandise.   Laser shows Evening.  8pm. 930pm. 11pm. Better than HK's A Symphony of Lights   57th floor Is a must to visit with the Infinity pool.  Strict access to pool which was good so it ruled out public and gave privacy.  But this pool was always…,5,11/14/2022
"On arrival at this iconic hotel we found ourselves carrying the luggage from the car and getting in to reception. No one greeted us so we made our way to the desk which we were lucky only took 30 minutes. I say lucky as we witnessed queues so long it would take hours to check in or out and we were told a two our wait was not unusual. Given that this hotel has 2,500 bedrooms it's easy to understand and on looking at the amount of lights that were not working and the dirt on the windows it's easy to see the staff are undermanned. Our room was clean but nothing great. Going back down to the lobby to go out is a new experience where hundreds of Chinese tourist cannon ball through the hallway between the three towers which is something like the first day of the Harrods sale. The pool…",3,11/15/2022

"Stayed in this hotel twice, in 2011 (when they just opened) and in May 2014.  Both stays were satisfying.  Stayed at Tower 1 with the view of Gardens By The Bay.  Enjoyed every minute of the stay.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Would not hesitate recommending.",5,11/17/2022
We stayed 2 nights. Swimming pool gives you the best shots of the city but very crowded. Staff in the pool were friendly. We were disappointed we were not allowed to use swimming pool after check.out. They could give access only for a couple of hours until we had to leave for airport. I believe hotel should review and manage their policy to satisfy customers. We were told NO as if we were no longer customers at checkout. The hotel is well served by metro and has a huge mall. It takes less than 10 minutes to city's centre. ,4,11/18/2022
"Location is superb, rooms are spacious and clean with wonderful views and you are right at the MTR. BUT thus a huge complex with three linked hotels so every facility is jam packed. they even have six staff on the concierge desk. The buffet is massive but too packed for us - we took the MRT to the Fullerton each day for breakfast just for the ambience.  AND this hotel wanted $225 for an airport transfer - got an identical limo through a colleague for just $50.  Come on!!!",4,11/19/2022
"we've actually been to this hotel for a couple of times, and the recent one is our trip to Singapore last week, The place is usual very attractive to us by its conveniet to the mall and the outdoor greenery like the ""Garden by the bay"". For this trip we choose the view facing the Merlion, and the manmade lake, stunning view at nite.  For the room itself, they're really clean and fresh, I guess the cleaners must have a really proper training in cleaning up all the rooms and the bathroom. Everytime we enter the room they always smells great. Pity for this time we dont have the time to swim on their infinity pool on their rooftop as the swimming pool was used for a shooting location or something last week.  The breakfast on the lobby is really massive and a lot of varieties to…",5,11/20/2022
"I found this hotel really nice. Rooms are very nice - and service is great. The views from the top floor - and the infinity pool are fantastic, no less. the fitness center is also very high quality - and I found that no matter what time, I visited, there was room enough - and the view from the rooms is quite motivating as well.  The underground train makes travelling to the center from the hotel quite easy.",5,11/21/2022

"Even though for me Singapore is the most beautiful country and you need to see allot, make sure that you allocate at least one entire day to enjoy MBS. You will not feel like leaving the hotel, the breathtaking view from the Infinity pool and Jacuzzi on the other side will make you stay. Do not miss the bar right next to the pool on the 57th floor during the night !! Staying in MBS is definitely worth the money :) Enjoy !!",5,11/25/2022
"We spent a night here before heading to Malaysia. The hotel is spectacular: from the infinity pool (the hotel's signature attraction) to every other detail. Rooms are big and spotless, staff responds promptly to any request and breakfast on rooftop (Sky57) is breathtaking. Speaking of which... I was served, together with all sorts of buffet food, the best poached egg of my life. Lunch at the AlFresco bar at the pool, on the other hand, did not live up to expectations, that are obviously high for a place like this. A must if you are visiting Singapore!",5,11/26/2022
I went to Singapore for a 4-day Vacation but I checked-in at a different hotel for my first 2 nights and I booked my last night at Marina Bay Sands to experience it and to relax after a very tiring tour for 3 days. I booked online through Agoda but maybe next time I'll book directly to them. We took a cab from our hotel to MBS and upon arrival the bellman greeted us and assisted us with our luggage. He politely asked me to write my name in the tag so he can keep our luggage. We arrived during the peak of check-out and there are lots of people at the lobby but since I read some reviews about MBS I already expected the scenario and it's quite manageable especially they are offering a very hassle-free express and video check-out to avoid the queue but for check-in of course we have…,5,11/27/2022

I have stayed at hotels- small and large -throughout Europe, Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa, & the USA.  I've observed that when gueests treat the staff with respect they receive cordial and attentive service in return.  . My suite was well appointed . Everything was clean and in good order.

Staff not as helpful or friendly.  Took 3 attempts to get our room serviced.

"It's a nice hotel, Most rooms are big and with quality finishes. The pool is the icon of the hotel sitting at 57 floors it have excellent view of the Singapore City skyline. Everything is in good and working condition..  Only thing is crowd.. with 2500 rooms you can expect easily over 3,000 guest so service can take a while and waiting for check in and check out can be long. Taxi Q are also long at peak periods. Pool is always crowded (Dont expect to do laps) even at 7am in the morning. Restaurant Q for BF can take a while especially between 7-9am Peak period.  Overall a good place to stay for the novelty if you have to stay in Singapore for a few nights.. Great shopping just beside the hotel. Train station just below.. Tons of Amazing Resturant nearby....  Must try at least…",4,11/30/2022
"I have stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on two occasions.  The hotel rooms are average and not outstanding at all. They are just like any other hotel room.   The service of the hotel is where it loses a lot of marks. The hotel is so busy and run like a casino that when you want to check in and check out you have to queue up like some sort of government office.  When you want to reach reception or room service from the telephone you are put on hold for 10 minutes.  The only saving grace is the infinity pool which is the most famous plus point of the hotel.  If you want to swim in the infinity pool stay at this hotel. If you want a hotel with service, great rooms and a total 5 star experience I recommend staying at other hotels in Singapore. Please remember this building is geared…",3,12/1/2022
I stayed here for a magical 3 night stay for a Girl's weekend away to celebrate a friend's birthday! It was sensational. The food was superb and that view from the infinity pool at the top was breathtaking. The view of the Gardens by the Bay from our room was magnificent and by staying here it was so convenient to visit this attraction as well. Staying here was close to everything. Unfortunately it is just so expensive but by sharing the costs with my girlfriends it wasn't so bad. A stay I will never forget. It was hard to leave! ,5,12/2/2022
We visited Singapore because I lived there for one year and wanted to show this nice place to my friend. We booked 2 nights in a room with view to the marina bay. The hotel is very nice and clean. I don't understand why people say there is poor customer service. In my case we were treated very well and friendly. We ordered room breakfirst in the morning and it was so delicious and the room service was so nice. The only thing about to complain is from my point of view the somehow overcrowed infinity pool deck. Although only hotel guests may stay on the deck and in the pool it is so crowded and all the nice places are occupied by groups of people. It's hard to have some calm moments there and enjoy the view on the financial district or take some pictures. The deck restaurant is…,4,12/3/2022
"This was the second time , i was staying in this hotel ! Although its hyped to all extent but the kind of service they provide was below expectations. The Room had a smell and even the phones weren't working properly! The first day when we checked in , we were given a handicapped room, which wasn't necessary for us ! Neways the only good thing about this hotel is you have everything beneath it !",2,12/4/2022

Initially we wanted to book a premium room with city view but its all sold out! We booked a duluxe room with city view & Breakfast instead. Costs about $860++ per night. Stunning view of the city!  My advise is that if you want a room with better view, book a room with city view (19th floor and above).  The room is big. A king size bed, Sofa, desk and coffee tables. And there's a lot of floor to ceiling mirror!!  When you enter your room and you slot in your room card, the curtain will automatically open and show you the stunning view of the city!.

"We were booked to spend our 5th wedding anniversary and the end of a 2 week Singapore holiday at Marina Bay Sands. During our holiday, we sent an email asking about a late check out, given we were already paying $600 for a 3pm check in, 11am check out (which actually worked out to a $720 per day room). The responding email was cold, impersonal and said that if we wanted a late check out (which we wanted to use the pool for the afternoon, as we had a 1040pm flight) we would have to pay a fee. When I enquired about the fee, I was told it would be $300 for an extra 7 hours, so to pay $900 for a 26 hour access (effectively making the room $820) per day. Well, no pool is worth $300 for 7 hours, so we cancelled our booking altogether, and upgraded our room at our current hotel. After…",1,12/6/2022
The city view high floors has better view than the garden view rooms. Been here a couple of times but until now im still confused with their elevators so many times you have to transfer specially if you're coming from their infinity pool down to tower 2. There's nothing special with their rooms except for the views and huge elegant bathroom. The infinity pool was amazing and the view was spectacular but no tranquility.

For starters - - not elderly not child friendly.  Walk miles from the taxi drop off and car park - no security at all. 2 parcels left in the middle of the foyer outside lift lobby in plain sight Had to get the restaurant cleaner to look for security guard or staff to clear it After 5minutes still none to be seen - in the 10minute trek from lobby to room door NOT A SINGLE SERVICE STAFF TO BE SEEN Thats just for starters  Room is plain dowdy and sparsely furnished Amenities are 3 to 4 star only Only saving grace is the bathroom: westin standard Only 2 power points: one used for kettle leaves one for laptop and mobile and everything else to share Room thermostat doesnt work Hot as anything  Need i say more?

Our deluxe room was on the third floor in tower three. Room was spotlessly clean and comfortable as you would expect for a five star hotel with all the amenities that you require however the shower was not very powerful at all which is a shame. The wifi was very fast though! The pool is obviously the focal selling point for this hotel and it was great to relax and take in the breath taking views from the pool deck however some of staff on the pool bar were not very friendly and would often ignore you whilst you wait for ten minutes to be served.

For me, it is very important that i can relax and enjoy a nice pool and grounds and this place is absolutely fantastic for that. I could not stop raving about the Skypark for days. I visited the pool in the afternoon and in the early morning and was blown away by the magnificence of the building. I never experienced any kind of queues at check in or out and was satisfied with all service aspects of my stay. This is a great place and i will return.",5,12/10/2022

The premier room was spotless, large, quiet and very comfortable.  We had a great view from the 31st floor of the Gardens by the Bay although it may have been better without the haze that was present over the city during our visit.  The view from the SkyPark was spectacular as expected, although we didn't have much time to spend up there and available seats looked to be quite limited.

This hotel is really not that great value. Nonetheless, as mentioned by some reviewers before, I was also sufficiently impressed by the view from the Skypark, especially the night view from the infinity pool, and enjoyed using the uncrowded 55th floor gym, which also faced the skyline, albeit unclear on a hazy day.

The rooms are very nice and the even view from our sixth floor room over to the Gardens By The Bay was fantastic.  And of course the view from the 57th floor bar and pool is something you won't forget. There are some downers like the sensor pad bar fridge that calculates automatically if a drink is taken out, so you can't even take out their beers and put in your own '7 eleven' purchases! And the drink prices on the 57th floor like lots of Singapore are very expensive.  But that's just being picky.

The rooms are basic and very bland, apart from better toiletries, and coffee making services you could be staying at any huge chain/branded hotel. Bit of a disappointment for the price.   The pool is also, beautiful, however its too busy, even if you get up super early to find a spot/lounger it's impossible. And it's full of screaming kids and people leave their stuff everywhere, - it's just not relaxing at all. Like most people I'm sure, we booked it for the pool. Didn't end up using it.

"We stay in this hotel because we wanted to go to the casino. BIG SURPRISE!!! When we tried to go in they didn't let us in because some nationalities are forbidden to access!! Nothing mention when we booked the hotel. Big disappointment!!!! Even the Rooms disappoint us, everything new but with a very very bad taste! Definitively with this amount you can get much better hotel. NEVER AGAIN!!!!! ",1,12/25/2022
"I stayed in this hotel with my friend in the month of February. And at once I loved the hotel. BEAUTY, LUXURY and HOSPITALITY define it. Being into construction myself I could do nothing but marvel and the architecture of the property.   We stayed in the suite room at the 35th floor which had a marvelous view. On one side was the beautiful sea and on the other was a captivating view of the city. We had a great time sitting in the balcony and sipping coffee. The room was very comfortable and had all luxurious amenities one could think of. However, I was not very happy with the housekeeping staff baring which I loved the room and its feel.  The hotel it itself is a beauty and has all things one can think of. The hotel even houses a casino. The most attractive element to the place…",5,12/26/2022
Stayed there 2 nights with my family during the formula 1 race. It was stunning. The pool is courgeous. The casino is fantastic. The skyline from the 54th floor is amazing. We had a wondderful getaway in singapore.,5,12/27/2022
"One of the most spectacular hotels we have ever visited. The swimming pool on the 57th floor is absolutely wonderful! Amazing food with great choice of cuisines. The hotel has everything for all types of guests be it couples, with kids, business, casino lovers, etc",5,12/28/2022
"This amazing piece of architecture  and landmark of Singapore  is definitely  worth a visit.  It's a massive hotel ,so your  intimate  boutique  hotel experience  will be elsewhere , maybe as we did for a 6 night stay, which started  with 2 nights here  then  4 nights at the Quincy.  Totally different  but fantastic hotels. I realise this is sounding more like a short stay  itinerary  suggestion, but there are already so many reviews posted  that tell you that the rooms  are large and clean and have great views in either  direction, the bathrooms are marble and magnificent,  and of course, THAT POOL.!  Some tips if you stay here.....      Check-in isn't as  bad as some reviews  claim . Took us 10 mins. on a busy day.      Mini bar is motion  activated,  toy with it at your …",5,12/29/2022
"After friends highly recommended Marina Bay Sands we decided to spend the final nights of our trip there and we are so glad we did!  It is simply wonderful in every way.  It has left us with very special memories.  We upgraded to Club status which we felt was worthwhile, though expensive.  It ensured us a very large, luxurious room on a high floor with spectacular views over Singapore, a delicious breakfast, afternoon tea (lunch for us) and snacks and drinks between 5 & 7 pm (dinner for us), as well as access to the simply breathtaking Skypark on the rooftop which features the most sensational infinity pool you could find.  The staff were the best we found in any of the ten countries we visited.  They remembered our names and welcomed us warmly at every breakfast, lunch and…",5,12/30/2022
"Would rate as 4.5 stars :) Spent 6 nights in a Club City View room. An absolute deluxe holiday. From the first phone contact, MBS was impressive. Booking via phone went smoothly.  Arrival at hotel, Check-in needs a little polishing. We were given NO information about room or Club privileges, we had to ask questions about things I believe should be readily available, either given at check-in or as a letter in room, as we receive this at other hotels when receiving club benefits.  The information I got was different from each contact so maybe some extra training is required to get all employees on the same page.  Had a issue at check-in with credit card verses cash payment. Turned into a big drama for us as we paid cash but my credit card was also debited.  On to the great parts!!…",4,12/31/2022
"I had stayed in MBS for 2 nights and it was an amazing experience. The views from the hotel rooms are amazing- during day time you can clearly see the Merlion on the other side of the bay. It gets all the more beautiful at night :) There are shopping arcades, casinos and so many other escapades within the resort. The food and the hotel service were impeccable. Had a wonderful experience over the two days of my stay.",5,1/1/2023
"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel has all the accolades of a 5 Star Hotel. If you are planning to stay here, I recommend that you set aside adequate time to explore and enjoy the hotel facilities. The Sky Park, pool, restaurants and dance clubs on level 57 are marvelous. You can enjoy the park day and night. the dance clubs are intimate and play international music. The hotel is accessible via two subway stations and is linked to a mall and casino. There is also a link with  the Bay Gardens.  We were luck to watch the F1 from the hotel window and TV at the same time.",5,1/2/2023
"We stayed in a great high level room facing the gardens. Hotel was very clean, staff very friendly and helpful, loved the infinity pool. Only slight comment is a great balcony area but with no patio furniture.",4,1/3/2023
"This is a fantastic area to visit day or night with a multitude of restaurants and a casino if you're so inclined. The bar/restaurant on the top of the boat ( Marina Bay Sands)  on the  57th floor, has fabulous views particularly at night. There is normally a charge but somehow as pensioners we got in free ( our daughter is going to hire some every time she goes) The boast is the highest swimming pool in the world The only downside is the drinks prices ( 2 cocktails and a pint of Tiger £42)",4,1/4/2023
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for one night at the end of our honeymoon. We got upgraded to a room with an amazing view. When checking in, instead of having to wait in a long line, one of the hotel staff took us to a VIP check in area where the line was much shorter (we weren't VIP at all). Close to subway and easy to get around. Lots to do around the hotel as well, such as the mall, and the beautiful Gardens at the Bay. Very satisfied with the service.",5,1/5/2023
"Enjoyed each night of stay with fun and drinks at the Infinity pool...""ate to death"" during the much awaited buffet breakfast with all kinds of cuisines, name it and you'll have it! No boredom for a day is not even enough to explore the hotel, its shopping arcade and the like.",5,1/6/2023
"Impressive hotel, with rooms in 3 different towers. Do try to get high level room, facing the Gardens by the Bay. Curtains automatically slid open when you enter the room, very spacious and nice fittings. USB ports on both sides of the king size bed, very convenient. Was staying there for a night for conference so wished had more time to explore the hotel, the sky terrace, infinity pool and restaurants. Lovely evening walk to the Gardens by the Bay would also be a highlight of your stay.",4,1/7/2023
"Things I liked: Location. Connected to MRT, beside shopping mall and restaurants, beside Gardens by the Bay Lots of taxis waiting outside  Free wi-fi in rooms Excellent service from reception to housekeeping to room service and hotel restaurants. All staff are polite, friendly, helpful and speedy Clean and big room and bathroom, comfortable pillows and bed Fantastic view of the city  Things I didn’t like: PRICE! Too expensive. Fridge is not free. There’s a fridge but it is full of mini bar items. Even 1 bottle of mineral water will no longer fit inside. If you want another fridge you have to pay for it. For the price we paid for the room, the fridge should be free already. Too much people at lobby and swimming pool   But overall, I still love this hotel. This is my second stay…",4,1/8/2023
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 1 night after checked out from Conrad Hotel.  We approached counter at 0900hrs to register before start our journey to UBS..we was shocked early check in given to us for this visit.  Our room located on 27th floor at Tower 1 and faces the Gardens by the bay. It was such a nice view especially at night.  The hotel room is spacious and attached with balcony, which can see F1 track too. The room was very comfortable and I really admire with the bathroom. The bathroom divided by two shower room and ""poo poo"" room and bathtub at near to dressing marble cabinet.   The Sky Park Pool on 57th floor was crowded with people enjoying the panaromic view of the city.  Average buffet breakfast was served in Rise restaurant and was crowded.

"What an architectural masterpiece, Its a gorgeous building in a beautiful city. The grounds are nice. We enjoyed a drink at the top and a walk through the casino and shopping center. It's more impressive from a distance. Worth a short visit even it you are not into casino's and shopping centers.",4,1/11/2023
Architecture impressive but too much crowds. The swimming pool was too crowded. We had to walk the whole stretch of pool deck to find only one empty pool chair to put our things at the third rows. We had to queue for 15 minutes for a table for breakfast. There were no decent sofa to sit down at the lobby but everyone just sat at the edge of a glass sculpture.   We do not feel it is value for money since it is quite pricy.   The staff are friendly and helpful!  There were a good variety of food selection for buffet breakfast. ,3,1/12/2023
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands on 28 September 2014.    We did the pre-registration check-in at 12pm and were given our room cards which allow us to visit the Sky Park while waiting for the room to be ready.  Around 1pm while having our lunch at Rise restaurant, we received a call from the hotel that our room is ready.  This, I must say, is considered quite a short waiting time given the number of rooms that the housekeeping team need to turn over after the each guest had checked out.  It was truly a pleasant surprise when we arrived at our room on level 27 at Tower 3.  The spaciousness of the room has exceeded our expectation, it was a big room compared to the hotels we had stayed at our previous staycations in Singapore.  Our room faces the Gardens by the Bay.  It was such a…",4,1/13/2023

"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino is a must-see if you find yourself in Singapore. Consisting of three high-rise hotel buildings, a ground-level casino, and luxury shops adjacent to both the casino and the underground parking facility, this complex is a first-rate attraction. The hotel buildings are hundreds of feet high--possibly the highest  structures in Singapore, and topped by a platform that contains a full-service bar and an infinity swimming pool with inspirational views of the city and the harbor. My wife and I couldn't resist ordering classic Singapore Slings (sorry!) while viewing the city from the top of the hotel!  If you are of a mind to shop, you will find many of the same luxury stores as line the sidewalks of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hillls (come well-heeled).…",5,1/17/2023
Family holiday with 13 for my 50th Birthday.  Hassles with the booking process. They booked one more room than we needed.  One of the adjoining rooms was smoking and tried to tell us initially it was not..Erica in Premier services was brilliant at check in despite the problems with rooms and reservation. We paid over $500 per night per room and the same rooms were over $900 when I tried to book the following week for my sister (apparently the increase their prices double when Chinese Golden Week is on).    Pool was a brilliant experience but it was packed and getting a sun lounge was a joke.  So many Tourist taking selfies it was impossible to relax.   My father has a premier rooms but it was nothing special - to quote my daugther - it just had a bigger bathroom and bath...they…,2,1/18/2023
Amazing hotel. A city iconic building which changed Singapore skyline offers luxury and huge rooms full equipped with a wide range of details and facilities.  I strongly recommend a visit to the infinity pool in the top of the building and a walk throughout the sky-park.   Luxury commercial hall as part of the hotel facilities.   Friendly staff.  Key point to improve -> the room's minibar. Sensors system to charge products directly to the customer does't work properly!!.  Highly recommendable as long as you have your wallet ready 😉  ,5,1/19/2023
"All around place to be in Singapore. From the entrance, the people, the rooms, the pool and the bar at the roof, the view, the view of the city and the bay, the food.   If you can afford it try it.It is all new Singapore in one place",5,1/20/2023

"I recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to enjoy a nice escape from the hectic workplace. There's a brilliant skyview from Level 57 from the 150m pool (open 6am - 11pm) so plenty of time to lap up the atmosphere. We really enjoyed spending a few days there, dining, shopping, gymming and relaxing in the Pool, hot pool and sauna.  The staff are friendly when checking in and out.  Only thing is the mini fridge in the room are packed with goodies but are electronically controlled, so anything taken out will be automatically charged to your account. There's no room for your own storage of drinks/food. A mini bar fridge can be requested at the cost of $10, which I thought should already come with all other amenities with the room.   Overall, love this hotel and definitely…",5,1/22/2023
"Pool is great. Rest is lacking. Much better hotels everywhere in Singapore, stay in one of those and pay to visit the pool; you'll get the best of both worlds then.  Check in was painful, checkout fasical (and billed for the wrong room!).  Hotel is a long way from anywhere so more a resort; taxi queues are long. Better staying more central if you plan to go anywhere other than the hotel in Singapore. Feels like a budget Vegas hotel.        ",1,1/23/2023
Fantastic stay. A bit crowded in parts. Wonderful views spectacular light show. This is one hotel you must visit in a lifetime. Don't bother with breakfast at Rise you'll have to line up to get in. Go upstairs for breakfast or across to the shops. The restaurants are wonderful and if you've got money to splash then hit the shops. Wonderful beds comfortable huge bathrooms - get a room with a city view as it's worth it.,4,1/24/2023
"My wife and I had just attended the F1 Grand Prix and had a spare day in Singapore. Our grandstand seats faced the Marina Bay Resort and the spectacular looking ship shaped roof structure atop it. We watched a continuous laser light show projected onto the end of the building. Moving F1 cars, fighter planes, etc. Therefore, we decided to visit the building after the race as we assumed the views would be spectacular from there. It was well worth it. We took a taxi there and then an elevator to the open viewing area. There is quite a lot of room up there and the views are indeed, spectacular. The hotel end of the roof is closed to all but residents, as is the pool area. It was quite warm in the sun and seeing the hotel residents in the pool only about one hundred metres away was a…",5,1/25/2023
"I spent 4 nights at the hotel and I'll not go back!  The price is exceptionally high but the service it is not as high as the service. For example the fridge of the room is looked and if you want to have something you have to call the room service and... Only for the call you have to pay 10 dollars.  I had a special deal with additional services included and private check in and one free pressing included so I asked to wash and iron a shirt, but I got invoiced.  I went to the private check in and the answer was ""there is the name of the person that cleaned the shirt on the invoice, you just have to call her.""  At the second attempt to understand (at the normal desk)  I discovered why I was invoiced.  Only the ironing was free,  but not the washing... COME ON!  THIS IS A JOKE FOR…",2,1/26/2023
We had booked the cheapest room as they were all quite expensive. We arrived at about 11 and we were instantly checked in and upgraded to a huge room with amazing water views on the 48th floor.

From the stunning rooftop infinity pool which takes in the surrounding Singapore skyline (as the lift opens to the poo area the view takes your breath away) to the smorgasbord of food on offer in the lobby, rooftop area and casino and it's surrounds, our first night of our honeymoon could not have been in a more beautiful place. I highly recommend anyone to stay in this magical place. It's also well located with a train and bus station at doorstep. The gym has the best view I've ever seen in any gym and the gym itself also some better facilities and equipment then many normal gyms back home in Australia.

Great for a nice little walk and gander if you fancy it, feels way too chilled out to be in the centre of a massive city! There some comfy beach style chairs you can have a lounge & a nap on with suberb city views, far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city streets",4,2/1/2023
Shocked when stepped in to lobby. Very noisy. Like a mall to me than felt like in 5star hotel reception. Checked in with my partner for 2 nights in Premiere Suite. Were given room above 35th Floor with city/marina view. Room were clean but whole layout Im not impressed due to maybe I have high expectation. Skypark infinity pool water not so clean. Very crowded & noisy. Its like walking on the beach. Personally I felt this hotel the WOW thing its only the view. Overall were average.,3,2/2/2023
"My last stay was not really satisfying. It was my second time staying here, but this was my first time taking my son. I did understand if they're always very busy in any hour. However, I didn't expect that whole big crowd waiting in their lobby. They practically didn't provide any proper seats for the guests to wait while their relatives were checking in/out or while themselves waited to check-in/out. In fact, the guests should sit on the two marble blocks with glass ornaments. If it's impossible to place some comfy couch, then maybe they should consider to provide more waiting lounges. Moreover, on my previous visit, they have a shuttle bus to the airport and it was very helpful since I was pregnant at that time. On our last visit, they told us that they didn't have that…",3,2/3/2023
"This is our 4th time to this property, and every stay we love it more, yes I have read the reviews about the crowded pool , lobby et.... but what do you expect from a landmark building people want to have a look and use the facilities just like we do. Grand Club room was fantastic, clean, bright and just what we expected. We come her every year for the GP and always treat ourselves afterwards. The staff at The Club are great and very friendly. Keep up the good work we will be back. Treated like VIP's everyday loved it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2/4/2023

"After looking forward to our stay we finally arrived to what can only be described as the biggest let down ever. On entering this supposedly 5* hotel ,you find yourself in a large queue to register, reminiscent of an airport check in. Also having stayed in many 5* as a rule usually doormen are there as soon as you exit a taxi and luggage is taken off your hands and deposited later in your room . Not here ,it's all DIY. Unless you want a long wait. Once checked in it's like walking through a shopping mall and train station that have amalgamated with a holiday camp. The rooftop pool apart from the view is overcrowded,noisy, tacky and decidedly uninviting. We didn't even unpack even though we had been upgraded to a magnificent suite. We just left... If you want to stay in a truly…",2,2/6/2023

We were taken to the VIP check-in for some reason.. not complaining about that :) All the staff have gone beyond the standard of all the other 5 star hotels I have stayed in. The gym was amazing!!! we had doors opened for us, towels handed to us, the staff were constantly cleaning the equipment keeping it to the perfect standard! the view was amazing! there were also refrigerated face towels for after working out, and chilled apples :) the rooftop pool was the most beautiful pool I have ever seen!! there was a towel concierge, free iced water... and there were staff walking around constantly collecting towels and taking drink orders :)…",5,2/8/2023

"Definitely a place which you should add at least once on your trip Singapore. No need to comment the pool, the architecture - this is unique and everyone knows it. Positively surprising was the warm welcome at the reception and the mostly very friendly staff; one roomservice even overdid it a bit by coming in and saying ""Hi Boss, how are you today?"".  Location is great too of course, overall yes, expensive but definitely worth the money you spend.",5,2/13/2023

There was a long queue at reception but we were quickly whisked off by a staff member to the VIP check in as they were less busy. We were given a room on floor 49, with everything explained to us about the lifts, swimming pool access etc. We couldn't fault this hotel, it's very big and noisy on the ground level, but once away from this area, much quieter. We had little need of any help, but certainly feel that had we done we would have been seen quickly. Every staff member we came across was polite, friendly and ready to help if necessary.

"went to just look around and decided that since we didn't use our spending money up we would go all out and book a room at one of the fanciest places in Singapore. BEST DECISION EVER. it was amazing. The rooms were massive and our balcony overlooked the light show in the gardens and the water. The roof top is definitely the highlight, amazing views, massive pool and super comfortable lounges, so comfortable i accidentally fell asleep on one. Food and drinks a bit pricey but to be expected, there is a mall below which has a cheap food eatery with a wide selection. Only down point would be that the power our room went off twice, but was fixed. Would recommend to everyone, worth a stay as a once off or to round off a trip in Singapore.",5,2/16/2023
"2nd time to Marina Bay Sands, this time 5 days with the girlfriend (06/09/2014 - 10/09/2014) as opposed to 1 night on my way home from a 6 week Eurotrip with a mate a few years ago.  We booked 3 nights in a Deluxe (basic) room and 1 night in a Club room to keep costs down, but on arrival were given 4 nights in a Club room at no extra cost. Service at all points, from reception to rooms service to pool side was top notch.    On arriving at the airport to head back home to Perth on an evening flight, our flight was cancelled due to forecast fog in Perth.

The only disadvantage is that breakfast is not included in the price, and there are limited and expensive options for breakfast inside the 3 towers.",5,2/18/2023

Although was only on 6 th floor so not such an impressive view. Lobby area was very noisy at all times, more like a shopping centre...not really the ambience I,d of expected. Thought we got a great price deal through booking.com but once there and taxes were added it turned out to be a very expensive swim. Been done it and got the t shirt but wouldn't return.",3,2/20/2023

"Check in was long and tedious and we had requested, in advance for our children's room to be next to ours, they were not which upset me a lot.  This for me is a safety issue, should there be a fire or any other emergency in the hotel. Our room overlooked 'gardens by the bay', the views were beautiful day and night!   The hotel is large and architecturally beautiful, although it is bit of a trek to get to breakfast it is well worth it.  Location is good for the gardens and the local mall but the main shopping area and restaurants of Singapore are a taxi drive away. The infinity pool was beautiful and the views absolutely stunning but maybe a little on the small side for a hotel of this size.",4,2/22/2023
"What a pitty that this hotel does not deserve 5 stars. It is not worth to pay that price for such crowded place, even if the swimmingpool has a stunning view. The room was very noisy, like a motel on the motorway. We changed the room but it doesn't make any difference. The cleaning is not very efficient, when you have a look on the sofa in the room. The swimmingpool is crowded,on the top of that childrens are jumping into it from the sides, in front of the eyes of the pool guard. Check in took 30 minutes, and we waited another 30 minutes to get our luggage to the room. I have never exprienced such a low-level service, not even in a 1 star hotel.

I expected the facilities to be magnificent and – of course - they didn’t disappoint. Plenty of others have gone on about that, so I won’t.   What motivated me to write this review is that I was really impressed with the attitude of the staff toward us “normal people.” Keeping in mind that there are guests here who are paying over $25,000/night (and you could be swimming right next to them!) my friend and I showed up in shorts and backpacks, knowing full-well that our money would buy us the space, but that the service could go either way. After all, there are some places where your very presence just brings down the prestige of it, and…",5,2/24/2023
"Room is very clear and comfortable, the space is widely, the beds make us a good sleep, the view outside the window is memorable, even the request of ice bucket is soon to be completed. The infinity swimming pool is the spotlight, and we enjoy it every day.   房間非常乾淨與舒適，寬敞的空間，一覺好眠的床，窗外動人的風景，都讓人難忘。請櫃檯送上冰桶及冰塊速度也非常快。最佳亮點是無邊際泳池，每天都去游，令人難忘。",5,2/25/2023
"This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel but feels like a marketplace in the lobby. Shouting and people mountain, people sea. The infinity pool was packed but this was expected and there should really be a rule for kids not to splash water around especially when people go there specifically to take photos. I stayed at many other hotels with memorable experience in singapore, for example the mandarin oriental sg. Beautiful and great service, the ambience was amazing and whats better? The price was way more worth what i paid at MBS! $350 for a similar room (incl) + buffet breakfast. Definitely mbs was not worth $500 without any breakfast or whatsoever. Never wasting my money again!",2,2/26/2023
"We stayed here for a night at room 2887(non smoking).We like the room single bed, bathtub, balcony, and harbor view. The infinity pool is amazing!!! The view is spectacular especially at night although its only up to 11pm.  Definitely worth the price but breakfast not included paid for 399sgd.",5,2/27/2023
My wife and I just finished up another annual visit here for the F1's and to be very honest we are very undecided if we will return. We are in the process of re booking for the next Singapore F1's and we are starting to look at different hotels this time around to see what their reviews are like etc. We just found that this time around the personal attention was lacking in a few areas.   The payment system is confusing and not very efficient even the staff checking in/out don't understand it.  Your site should allow guests to prepay in advance. It was such an inconvenience to have to guess when your staff are going to process payment for some of the nights (the f1 nights) like a week Or so before our stay and then take payment for the some nights a day before we checked out. We…,3,2/28/2023
"Having previously stayed in a smaller hotel during our stay in Singapore, it was a relief to move to a larger, more luxurious hotel. We chose Marina Bay based on the advice from a friend and for that money shot of the city from the infinity pool. We stayed two nights at Marina and only wished we could have stayed there all week! Fantastic hotel!",5,3/1/2023
"I was traveling with my husband on business.  He was speaking at a conference in the adjacent Convention Center.  This is truly a one of a kind hotel.  We were there early on a Saturday morning and I had been warned of the crowds, but check-in was a very smooth process.  We were on the 48th floor with a sea view/Garden's by the Bay.  It was lovely.  The room was nice, nothing special for this caliber of hotel, but plenty of room, comfortable bed and nice bathroom.  Of course we took the requisite infinity pool picture!!!  I had the opportunity to lounge in the pool area a bit.  I never found it over-crowded and was always able to get a nice spot on a lounge chair.  We did quite a bit of walking in Singapore and found that the hotel was a great location to use as a locator.  Just…",5,3/2/2023
"We booked a deluxe room with City view and guarantee 19th floor and above. We arrived at 2pm one hour before the official check-in time but were lucky because the room was ready. The view from the room (24th floor) as well as from sky park is great. There was enough space in the pool area although the Hotel was quite full. In the afternoon it was even better than in the evening, more crowded. Only Access to pool area for Hotel guests, same for the sky park (except with ticket for sky park which costs you 23.-SGD). One reason why it is not excellent: the reception area is too small, if you arrive around 3pm, there are Long waiting lines.",4,3/3/2023
Nohing much to stay as my wife and i were more than satisfied. I will recommend to my business associates and family friends. This is amazing experienced we ever had.

"Stayed two nights in this hotel during my latest trip to Singapore. The check in line was long but it cleared quite fast and I managed to get a room within 20 minutes. The room allocated to me was on the 38 floor. It had a beautiful and un-obstructive view of the gardens and the sea! Good size room with all the fittings of a 5 star. Electronic powered curtains as well. Since I am on business trip, quickly settled down to organizing my table for work. This is where I find that it needs some improvements. The chair is not ergonomic and an hour with the laptop, my back is already aching! The water pressure in the shower cubicle is not strong at all. Its not weak either, but as a guest, one of the common expectations are a strong water pressure for the shower. The hairdryer is not…",3,3/5/2023
"Stayed here for four nights with a friend in Sept.  We loved the hotel.  Upon stepping inside we were greeted with a live band playing music.  The hotel is huge and seems to be in the center of all the beautiful places of Singapore.  The MRT and botanical gardens are just a short walk away and everything is very accessible.  The room was awesome.  We had a premier city view room and the view did not disappoint.  The beds were very soft and the bathroom was giant.  I will say that 41 dollars for continental breakfast is a bit high, but it's easy enough to find more affordable restaurants elsewhere.    The skypark was amazing.  The pool overlooking the city takes your breath away and they have a few Jacuzzis as well.  I thought it was a bit silly that they had restaurants but most…",5,3/6/2023
"While visiting friends in Singapore we checked into a ""triple"" room for us and our friend who's birthday it was while we were there.   We basically checked in so that we could all go up to the infinity pool which had been a bucket-list item for our friend since she moved to Singapore 2 years ago.  The ""triple"" room was just a standard king room with an extra camp bed in! So it was a huge price premium for a camp bed and extra person.  The extra bed was plenty comfortable enough though.  However, they did send us a lovely piece of cake as a Happy Birthday for her and upgraded us to a higher floor (41) which was very well received.  The check-in process was stupidly slow! They had all our details from the booking and just needed to enter identity details so I have no idea what…",4,3/7/2023

"Stayed here during a major conference in May, and could not find fault! Absolutely magnificent place to stay. Check in was very smooth and reasonably quick, as was check out. Started with a room facing the sea, but changed to one with a city view which is far preferable, and is slightly larger. The roof pool is most obviously the highlight, and I used it many times, swimming, lounging, reading, eating and drinking. Fantastic views in all directions. Breakfast on the ground floor was well run despite the numbers, with minimal queues, and great food. For the unique pool and views and prestige, would definitely recommend this hotel and will return myself. If not staying here, or full, my second best choice would be one of the Fullerton Hotels, whose main advantage is closeness by…",5,3/11/2023
"It provides probably the best pool at the world, but there is a bad thing there - the wind that you can't really hide from. The club on top is boring, if you're sober. The rooms are clean and good looking. Awesome for rich young couples! And one thing is really amazing is that you don't have to exit the building to get to the mall or subway!",5,3/12/2023
"This time is my fourth time staying in this hotel. I remember the first time I was here, I was so impressed by this hotel, the service is above average!  But now, this hotel still a good hotel, but way too crowded, and it seems like their staffs were overwhelmed, the check-in queue was too long, lobby area so noisy and crowded, even they dont have shuttle to airport anymore.  It just a pity watching this fantastic hotel slowly going down. But I cant lie, it still a good hotel, only in the future will I stay here? Consider the price and their service right now...

The staff at Sands is top notch and very friendly, the service level is up to the hotels category. The Marina Bay Sands complex includes a huge shopping arcade with flagship stores of all important brands worldwide. Singapore offers plenty of sightseeing options which can be reached easily by public transport (MRT).",5,3/15/2023

"We have stayed at MBS many times, whilst it is a large hotel the service levels are excellent with the staff making you feel very welcome. The hotel has an array of facilities but the pool on the roof is just amazing with spectacular views of Singapore the best in the region, you can swim during the day or you can go up at night and enjoy a drink whilst enjoying the skyline at night whilst still relaxing in the pool, you can also sit in one of the many jacuzzis on the roof which again have spectacular views of the gardens and the sea.  The hotel has many restaurants all of which are excellent, and the location of the hotel is excellent for getting to and from the touristy sites.  ",5,3/17/2023

However there's too many people and lacks the personal touch but you can't blame the hotel as one of the front agent told us that they have over 2,000 rooms so it's not bad at all! The hotel is very good for shopping and they have a light show at night. The view is just amazing and of course no body can beat their swimming pool! i would recommend this place if you're first time in Singapore and want to be close in the Marina.",4,3/20/2023

As soon as we arrived into the vast lobby of this hotel, we were greeted by very frendly and helpful staff,seeing as we had arrived on a late flight from Sydney,was expecting trouble getting food at 10.30 pm but the staff pointed us to an eatery located within the the Skypark.we ordered a couple of dishes which were superb.i have seen lots of photos of the infinity pool but to see it in the flesh was mind blowing.located on the 57th floor the veiws are spectacular the room that was allocated to us had veiws over the Harbour and was clean and crisp as expected.

I and my BF had very romanic dinner @ Sky on 57, and food was fresh, beautifully presented, and simply devine. The Infinity Pool located on 57 floor and in the middle of the boat is the must-visit, only accessible by hotel guests. Best time to see the view will be at night with all the lights on.

In fact all places were easily accessible in this superbly designed hotel - restaurants, shops and even the casino.

The hotel entrance is immense and although there is lots of people in the reception, there is also plenty of helpful staff milling about eager to assist you.  We booked the deluxe room with the large bath and a view of the garden. we enjoyed the fabulous view from the balcony with a glass of champagne as the sunset and the gardens giant trees were illuminated. The rooftop pool, bars and restaurants were the highlight of the stay. It even has an adult only section. It was a unique experience not to be missed! The food and service was an excellent standard, though a little pricey! The evening meal, wine and a few drinks afterwards cost nearly £250 GBP.

Last year we had impeccable service all round, this time around we got to see aspects where it is lacking personal touches/services or attention to detail. I rated this hotel exceptional last year - what has happened ! :(  On arrival here our limo driver was surprised to learn that we are returning guests advising us how busy this hotel gets and suggesting that there are a lot more hotels providing more personal service. We advised him how good it has been for us previously and how we wouldn't have a problem - well it didn't quite pan out that way completely.

Unfortunately I was told that it is a non-smoking room which I felt very funny. I explained that I was told it is a smoking room and I asked her to recheck with the receptionist. After 10 minutes she called to confirm it is a non-smoking room. This is so not professional and such a waste of time.

Then, across the bay, stop at the Fullerton Hotel, for a tea or coffee while people watching.    Stop by the Merlion area, you will have the wonderful almost 360 degree view of the Marina Bay.  A side-view picture of the larger Merlion statue is iconic, with or without you in it.  The fruit ice bowl at the coffee shop beside the Merlin Statue is a delightful surprise that I had this year.

Stayed here for the F1 for 4 nights.  The lobby is sooo huge that it looked like an airport.  Lots of people in the area.  Shops and restaurants are everywhere and food court is open 24 hrs which was a good thing coz after the race we got at the hotel around 1am and we need food and glad we found the place still open though about 3 or 4 stalls were open but still okay with us.  The pool area was also crowded but the water was good and the view was amazing!  The price during our stay was also very high maybe because of the F1 event.

"MBS is a gorgeous, modern hotel with some amazing amenities and a well-deserved reputation in Singapore.  The pool and recreation area on the Skydeck are understandably lauded and admired - try the Chocolate Bar (now with Cheese & Wine!) for an amazing late night, sweet experience.  I also love the Marina Bay location - the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands have everything you could want and some great restaurants including (two!) TWGs and an Osteria Mozza. My only concern with MBS is how busy and overwhelmingly huge it is.   Checking in and Checking out are reminiscent of Changi Airport with people milling everywhere. Consequently a little of the hospitality is missing. If you can get a private Check in/Check out on the Executive floors then go for it!",5,4/14/2023

"The MBS is stunning - that's undeniable. There is nothing quite like sitting in that Infinity pool overlooking the beautiful lights and skyline of the city. It's sensational. And the rooms are lovely and big, very clean and the bed is quite comfy however overall I would say the MBS lacks that personal level touch that you'd find at a smaller hotel - and that's probably why... the hotel is massive and with a lot going on besides just hotel accommodation. Its fantastic that's it's on top of the shopping mall where you can grabs food as well as some new clothes but most of the shops are the very expensive designer brand kinds.

"Great hotel, but hotel has an atrocious practice of letting you book one room, and then forcing you to upgrade upon arrival, because the room you booked is either in the worst possible location (2 floor out of 47( and if you want a different better location, you must wait, because they do not know what else is available.   I refuse to believe that with checkout time at noon, MBS does not know what rooms are available at 2PM. This is a predatory practice to force you to pay additional fees on check-in and this happened to me three times in a row.

First year check in was slow, suite was nice but balcony doors wouldn't close properly but above all else we had three breakfast's at MBS and they were all bad.  Food was cold, bland and just unpleasant.  If it wasn't for the bar at Ku De Ta and the pool on the 57th floor we wouldn't have rebooked for this year.  As MBS is in a great position to get to the track we thought we would give it a second chance.  Once again the customer service was poor.  Staff seem unwilling to help and overrun.

"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights mainly for the infinity pool! It did not disappoint. The pool is huge, the water temperature perfect. The only negative is that there is not enough sun-loungers for the amount of guests that stay, also people leave dirty towels on sun-loungers so you are unsure whether the lounger is free or taken. There are photographers in the pool, which is a nice touch but make sure you haggle when it comes to getting the photos and cd, we did and got it down by more than half!!  The room was a nice size. The room was very clean and we had a view of 'Gardens by the Bay' and some of the F1 racecourse which was awesome. We did not use in-room dining as we found the prices somewhat dear.  Due to the nature of the hotel, the lobby is very very busy…",4,4/26/2023
"We booked a suite for our family holiday in Marina Bay Sands during the month of September just after F1.  When we reached the hotel for check in,  we were greeted by Narae.  She was very polite and accommodating despite our large group.  She was patient and pleasant, in no way rushing to get her job done.  We appreciate her service and attitude and it is one of the best we have encountered so far.   When we entered our rooms,  we were blown away by the unblock view of Garden by the Bays and the sea.  The size and quality of the rooms were top notch.  We were very impressed with our time spent here.   Well done Narae and Mbs.  Thank you for such a memorable holiday.",5,4/27/2023
"What can I say about the Marina Bay Sands that have not been said?   - The pool is as amazing as they say - Sky on 57 has good breakfast selections - The Club lounge was underwhelming and mediocre at best - The Sands Suite was big, but not worth the extra upgrade - Get a room with the city view - Worth it to stay once.    All in all, I loved Singapore!  I am glad that we splurged and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on our first visit.  I'm very happy we experienced an amazing city view, stayed in the spacious Sands Suite, got access to the club lounge, ate breakfast that was included at the Sky on 57 restaurant, and relaxed at the infinity pool.    If I were to come back, I would look across the bay for more lush accommodations.  But this hotel is worth it for the pool access…",5,4/28/2023

"We stayed here like most people probably do because it is iconic and the infinity pool is world famous.  The hotel is huge, bigger even than some of the big Vegas hotels.. almost like a self contained city.  We had a city view room which was huge, well appointed, luxurious in a modern styled sort of way and  had magnificent city views from its wall of floor to ceiling windows.  The infinity  pool (open only to guests) is as spectacular as the photos suggest and wasn't too crowded during our visit.  We didn't experience any check in or check out delays that some reviewers reported and were allowed to check in a few hours early.  We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food.  At the price we paid it wasn't hugely more expensive than comparable city hotels so in our…",5,4/30/2023
The best thing of this hotel is the infinity edge pool mmm enjoyed lot. Always i wanted to experience that and it was like a dream to me. Food is delicious and the service was  stellar. wanna go again to experience the beauty,4,5/1/2023
My room smelled of damp and had water trickling sounds from air conditioner for my entire stay. This made it very difficult to sleep and as so it was not a very relaxing stay. The interior does not fit the rating and the outside look of Marina Bay Sands.              ,2,5/2/2023
"The main atraction of this hotel is the amazing swiming pool, one of the best I have ever seen. Beside this, there is a lack of follow up of the guest requets, its almost imposible to speak with somebody to arrange something prior your arrival, and if you request something special for your stay, even that you send thi request by email to the proper channel-employee on charge, in my case was never taken care.",2,5/3/2023
"Visited MBS over the weekend because of F1. Room is spacious and view was fantastic on the 30th floor. Had a room facing the Gardens by the Bay. The interior decor of the rooms was nothing to shout about. There are many hotels downtown that has much better interior decor. Hotel was super crowded at the lobby and the infinity pool. The pool with a gorgeous view, was worse than a public pool. It was super congested you can forget about swimming your laps. It is good enough for a soak at most. Hotel is overpriced, not worth splurging. Will not return again.",3,5/4/2023

"All people from this hotel treated me like a king. The room was clean and very comfortable. After a day walking through Singapore, I could relax at the pool located at 57th floor! Amazing! And the breakfeast: All tastes of Singapore in a single, warming place!              ",5,5/6/2023
view from swimming pool is fantastic but room condition was nothing special compare to other 5 stars hotel and not worthy as much as i paid. even receptionist gave us disable room without any notice..                             ,3,5/7/2023
"Pretty much loved our stay at Resorts World Equarius compared to this despite its almost twice price. If not for the Infinity Pool, I would not recommend staying at MBS. The room was undoubtedly spacious but nothing else more. The bathroom area was average, nothing exciting.       ",3,5/8/2023
"My wife and I stayed for two nights in a Grand Club Room with City View at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. From the 37th floor at tower 3 we had a perfect view over the city. Swimming in the pool at the roof at 57th floor and getting free drinks, breakfast, and canapés at the Club at the 57th floor was also very nice. Service was excellent throughout our stay, with one exception - I really can't recommend the Sky at 57th restaurant for breakfast. Service was not very friendly and it took ages to get our drinks - I even had to remind them three times to get my coffee. Don't miss the Garden by the Bay and the Supertrees right next to Marina Bay Sands.",5,5/9/2023
The glaringly visible untidy cables of the light rig damages the aesthetics of an otherwise charming ballroom. What a shame.  The same disregard for proper cable management is also wonderfully showcased in both the Grand Theater and Sands Theater. Attention to details is apparently not a virtue in this place.,3,5/10/2023
"Crazy high room prices, you would expect better service.but this place is geared towards gamblers or else men in suits for business. For leisure or holiday it is poor value.  Check in queue was long, rooms were miles away, pedestrian way was crowded, carpets were dirty and only 2 bottled water provided in a country whose perpetual weather is hot and humid. Welcome basket? Turndown service? Non existence. The only thing you get (apart from the 4star room) is a view of the gardens as well as access to the roof top swimming pool. And you need your key card to get into the pool. Painful. There are way better hotels with much friendlier staff who would make the extra effort rather than staff who just do not care. For the price paid it matches those of a 5star but sadly falls short in…",3,5/11/2023

"My boyfriend and I stayed here on floor 25 with a view of gardens by the bay. Although check in is supposed to be at 3pm, we arrived at 9.30, were given immediate access to the pool, and our room was ready by 10.30am despite check out not being until 11! Staff go above and beyond to make sure you are happy. Bed very very comfortable, we slept really well. The mod-cons in the room are fun - electronic curtains etc. were new to us having travelled around South East Asia on a much smaller budget for two months previous to our stay here to end our trip!  The infinity pool is of course breath taking. It never gets less exciting, at day or at night. We ate at the poolside café - service was fast and the burgers and chips were really good. Prices were surprisingly reasonable here.…",5,5/13/2023
"A complete disappointment. I have never had such a bad service for such a high price. Unfortunately, due to the famous infinity pool, the hotel can afford to lack in professionalism.   For our stop on our SEA trip in Singapore, we booked a deluxe room with city view for 1 night. We went to Singapore to visit my brother who resides in Singapore and asked for an extra access card to the sky park. While we received two free extra access cards for the pool on our last visit, we had to pay an exorbitant extra fee of SGD 100++ this time. Discussions led to nowhere. Nevertheless, we eventually paid the fee to get an the extra card.   The next disappointment followed soon. Our flight on the following day was in the evening. When we checked out before midday, we asked to have access to…",2,5/14/2023
"The whole Marina Sands is a destination on its own, the edge pool is to die for, the rooms are nice, we didn't eat at the hotel as it was as dear as poison but it was just a great experience, the shopping centre is also out of control. Definitely  worth a short stay.",4,5/15/2023
Loved our stay here all the staff really went out there way to make our trip perfect.We were only there for one day so really wanted to make the most of it. If toy go watch the sunset from the pool to say it day to night is amazing.can't fault our stay we will visit again.,5,5/16/2023
"The hotel is in great location and serves as the great sign of the city. The overall design and the swimming pool at the top floor is the breath taking scene. However, nothing in particular at the hotel room gave guest impressive memory indeed.

"Fantastic view on Singapore skyline from both the room and the pool! The pool is amazing! These are definitely the two big advantages of the Marina Bay Sands! Besides, it looks more as a theme park rather than a hotel: Shopping mall, bars, clubs, casino ... You have it all! It was very busy when we stayed there just before the Grand Prix started, so all areas were a bit packed. But that has to do with the hotel, which is meant to be busy. Not for a relaxing stay, but great experience for a weekend in town to experience a crazy architecture and fantastic views.",5,5/19/2023
We spend The last 3 days in singapore with small family ..my husband and my little boy in this spectacular hotel every thing is amazing from the active staff in the respetion for check in to the staff every where around the hotel ..we enjoyed our luxurious room in the 47th floor with breakfast in the club resturent..the shopping in the shopping center is hot like orchards road  The biggest fantastic roofless swimming pool I ever seen is realy wonderful   Just take the bridge to reach the wonder garden which realy wonder world of planet and amazing  architural design as every thing in singapore  You can view the flyer..the Lotus museum ..the floating LV building and enjoy the wonderful laisure show every night   I think this hotel is a must for anyone visiting singapore ,5,5/20/2023
"As another reviewer said: A great pool with a hotel beneath. This pretty much sums up my review too.  The setting is impressive. The pool is stunning. The hotel? Let's just say it needs more to suit my taste.  Yes, the facilities are great. Yes, the rooms are clean, the food on offer is fine although overpriced, all the staff is attentive and professional. But what about the soul? When I stay in a hotel I'd like to feel like home, not part of a landmark. But still, this is just me. Sorry Marina Bay Sands, you're fine but I'm not coming back.",4,5/21/2023

I told the Room service but their action is too slow. I have waited for 20 minutes. I cant wait and get out the room to pool. I have to call your team again and ask them to come by themself. After I was backed, no one told me anything has been done. Its just nothing. The room service sucks and need to improve immediately. I feel like you pay the money and just get in the room.

"Oh Dear.  This place always disappoints compared to the Grand Hyatt.  The club lounge chef  said the chicken yakatori was gluten free so I asked if it has soy sauce and they say yes therefore it's not GF and I nearly got poisoned with gluten.  Clearly they don't have a clue and to think they have the cheek to have a program on discovery highlighting their chef!  Sorry this is absolutely not acceptable for a landmark hotel in a country like Singapore. There is also a letter (in an executive club room!) saying that due to the summer holiday season, they expect a high volume of guests to have the audacity to want breakfast between 8 and 10 and to avoid those times if possible.  OK it's formula 1 weekend but they are charging a fortune and we are in a Club room.  Check in sucks,…",2,5/23/2023
"Just driving from the airport to the Hotel was an experience as soon at the Marina Bay Sands came into sight it is very impressive and the two day stay was memorable. The facilities are fantastic, especially the 54th floor Skypark with its infinity pool. Just breath taking. It is a must see location and to stay there was a real treat. Many restaurants and bars to choose from, along with a Mall and Casino. It is really a holiday resort in a hotel. Hope I get to visit again",5,5/24/2023
"Marina bay was a great starting point for my trip to singapore, it offered me a complete package from the huge hotel, lovely walking areas, shopping mall with lovely natural lighting in the day time, the unique sky swimming pool for hotel guests, and the easy access to gardens by the bay for quick day and night visits,",5,5/25/2023
"Great stay from the minute we arrived.  We arrived just after mid day, so the large lobby was very busy with guests both checking in and checking out. We where quickly ushered to the VIP check in and where processed very efficiently within minutes. We requested a smoking room , of which there are only very limited quantities of ,and still received it prior to the 3pm checkin time.    Our room type was Club, Garden Facing. I'd recommend this option as you have a balcony and spectacular views of the Illuminated gardens and light shows. We also had the luxury of a city view from our bathroom. We where on the 22nd floor .

"I have just returned from a 6 night getaway with my 16yo daughter.  This is the perfect place to stay and do as much or as little as you want.  The pool is superb, one big pool broken into 3 areas including 1 NO child area .... perfect.  There are plenty of dining options provided both at the hotel and connected shopping centre.  The access to bus, taxi and MRT is no problem with the airport being an approx 15 minute taxi ride. The Orchard Rd shopping area is a short cab ride or we did it via the ""hop on hop off"" bus which stops right outside the hotel. The beds are super comfy with clean and well kept rooms (as you should expect for the price paid)!! The gym is small but very well equipped with one of THE best gym views ever!! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it…",5,5/27/2023

The room was fantastic and spacious, beautifu, view over the city. I dont like that you have to change lifts to access the pool, its really a bad setup. The pool is great but yes its overcrowded most of the time. We enjoyed our afternoon drinks and canapes in the club access. The staff in this section are fantastic and always helpful, I asked for some cheese the chef bought me an entire plate.  The breakfast needs improving, it was either cold or just warm, same with room service. Overall…",5,5/29/2023
"Best hotel ever! It is expensive but worth it, we stayed for 1 night. Went to drop our bags off at around 12 even and we knew check in wasn't until later but they did everything they could to get us checked in early and upgraded our room! This also meant that we went straight up to the pool and there was only a couple of other people there! Worth a try checking in early if possible! The pool does get busier later on but it certainly didn't spoil anything for us. The rooms were lovely and had amazing views. Would highly recommend to anyone!",5,5/30/2023

"We stayed at MBS on 15th and 16th September, 14th floor. We have been to Singapore many times and usually stay at the Ritz Carlton Millenia. Yes the pool is fabulous and worth every penny, but the hotel is a bare bones operation! We had to queue for check-in, had to find our own room, then had to rent a fridge S$10 as the mini bar is monitored (bad luck for those traveling with medication). We had twin beds as no kings available, no turn down service, no lock on balcony door (which could be easily accessed from another room so we had to wedge it shut with chairs)! Our room was off the atrium so loud music woke us up at 12.30am! Also, to get to the pool we had to take 3 different lifts (which are slow) so try for a room above level 22. There was no late check out, no fruit, no…",3,6/1/2023

On arrival the cue for check-in appeared as though we would be in for a wait but we were quickly moved to a separate check-in area and in no time enjoying the view from our room.  All staff were happy to assist us with anything.",5,6/2/2023
"Our friend recommended this hotel for a romantic stopover at Singapore on our way back from New Zealand. We had high expectations. While the grandiose structure, height and rooms were very good, the extra large uber size of the hotel put us off. The lobbys are always crowded and feel like an airport terminal. You have to queue up for everything ..... Check in , Check out and even for breakfast!!!!",3,6/3/2023
just lov this place! so much to do and one would not know where to start or end. marina roof top and kudeta a must... the Singapore skyline looks much larger and attractive with 360 view. marina water show has always been a blast! high end boutiques and restaurant with plenty of activities for couples and families. the entire ambience and offering at marina bay is just overwhelming and truly exciting. a visit to Singapore without visiting the marina bay area is a huge loss! we will always return every year...rest assured.,5,6/4/2023
"The obvious plus here is the property itself.  Wow.  You almost can't go wrong.  The pool, the view from the room...  it's all quite breathtaking.  I was a *tad* disappointed by the hotel, however.  I suppose due to the reasonable room rates and sheer size of the hotel, it's bound to attract a LOT of people.  But in doing so, it kind of feels like a ""cruise crowd"".  A bit Disneyworld-ish...? I often felt like I was at one of those mega-casino hotels in Vegas or Atlantic City.  A VAST lobby, as far as the eye can see, which can be a pain in going to your room.  The service was nice, and the room service was great.  I am an American with American taste buds, so I was relieved to find a cheeseburger on the menu (a great one!), after so much Singapore street food.  The pool and…",4,6/5/2023

Had enjoyed the club evening cocktail with quite a list of wines,spirits,juices,tea. Food item was tasty roughly 30 choices of bites.  Infinity pool is a heated pool so no issue when swimming at night. There are also few jacuzzi at skypark. Banyan tree gym uses techno gym equipment, and in the changing room there is a  40°c hot pool and suana.  Breakfast at rise was fantasy with wide variety of food.  In room has led mirror, weighing machine, nesspresso machine and twg tea. Overall satisfied stay.",4,6/8/2023
"Firstly as a family we were disappointed the huge rooms could not fit 4 people in them, so we had an adjoining suite. The recent reviews are all true, the pool is packed, it does feel like walking around a railway station ( a nice one though!). The view of Singapore is spectacular though from the pool but you certainly get sick of people talking selfies for over an hour. We enjoyed our stay, the buffet dinner (discounted) was nice, the view of the gardens light show & general ease of getting around made our Singapore stay memorable.",3,6/9/2023
"Like you we'd read about it, we'd seen the photos in glossy mags and we had the want to try it for ourselves so we booked a room for two nights for a Sunday and Monday night. The hotel is huge and kept beautifully clean. Check in was easy and we found our room without difficulty. The room had an amazing view and was very big with a nice bathroom. Was it the sort of room I'd pictured for the price, absolutely not. We tried out the pool which was fantastic although very, very busy with seats hard to come by and goggles essential above the water due to the craze of people using selfy poles and swinging them around nearly taking your eyes out.

"We all know Marina Bay Sands for the wonderful pool that overlooks all of Singapore which is stunning even in person! The rooms are big and spacious and staff are friendly. It is in a great location if you are a wealthy person that can spend big at the mall which is a short walk underground joining the hotel if not then not much else around! The hotel is massive and sometimes it can feel to busy and if you need help hard to find someone not busy! This is a wonderful hotel and food is amazing as I ate at one of the many eateries in the hotel called Rise for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and there were always plenty of options. Surprised that in a twin room only single beds that weren't overly long! Everything throughout the hotel is very expensive but great quality!",4,6/11/2023
The pool and view are cool. But seems overrated over-all. This place only good for first timers. Not a good place to visit again as so expensive but staff are not high quality. The reception looks messy with all the people just walking or standing around. Really an overrated hotel. Did not impress me at all.       ,3,6/12/2023
"while the hotel itself is amazing and the amenities are great it feels like disneyland hotel. long queues at the check in/out in my opinion if you marjet yourself as an ""elite"" hotel let your service be the same.  we were provided with a wrong key to the hotel so instead of sending someone up to us they made go down (30 floors) with all of our bagage, when we refused they sent someone just to OPEN the door but without a new key, so we had to wait another 30 minutes in the room (BTW the wait time is shortened due to the fact that after 20 minutes i called the concierge). the hotels itself is great but the service and the industrial feel downgrades the experience",3,6/13/2023

The pool is amazing and open till 11am be sure to visit ku de ta aswel the restaurant on top of the hotel!

"We stayed here for one night just so that we could swim in ""THE"" pool.  It is a huge hotel and the whole lobby area is more like a railway station that a hotel lobby.  The check in/out facilities and the concierge facilities are hopelessly inadequate for the amount of guests they are dealing with.  We had a disabled person on our tour with us and were horrified to find seating in the reception area for perhaps 15 - 20 people.  In a hotel that has 2500 rooms, this is ridiculous.  The staff were not particularly helpful and the concierge was positively grumpy - but I guess you can't blame him! The room was clean and comfortable, no complaints there.  The pool area is great but they should have  ""kids only"" and a ""selfie only"" areas, so that one can actually enjoy the pool.",3,6/16/2023
"The only positive element in this hotel is the simming pool (including the staff there). Make sure though that you go around lunch time as in the early evening it is fully packed.   The rest was outright appaling. It is overpriced. We had to complain to get a good room as initially we were ""dished"" a room on the 6th floor just above the motorway. Very Very noisy for 300 euros a night... Then once you have checked out you cannot access the pool any more. Finally when we ordered the breakfast in our room we got charged an extra 5 euros as we ordered two fruit juices for one of us. This is the first time I see something like this. At best it is 3 star hotel but with 5 star prices.",2,6/17/2023
"How to review this hotel fairly ??? here goes. The hotel is part of a large high end shopping complex and casino.  Location very good for walks in the garden and has a subway MRT station, however unlike hotels on Orchard, there is nowhere ""outside"" to walk to. my first impression was not good. Reception is HUGE with the atmosphere and appearance of an Airport terminal, queuing included. The rooms are good, but normal for Singapore, nothing special. The swimming pool is a weird experience. its a tourist destination so non residents buy tickets and turn up to stand with residents  in the pool and enjoy the view. The weird bit is that no one swims as its a photo opportunity, so lots of people standing / sitting. In fact there were 2 official photographers in the pool when I…",3,6/18/2023

Arrived early (10 am), no queues at check in and room was already made up. 48th floor twin room in Deluxe City View... huge room with spacious bathroom. There is nothing to add to the amenities as the skypark, pool, mall etc are brilliant! The food outlets in the mall are not the quality they should be, in room dining on the other hand was excellent! All staff we have encountered were courteous. Prices on the rooftop bar are a bit iffy but you expect that due to the location. We will be back on the next stopover in SIN.",5,6/20/2023

After she served the old couple in front of me, she immediately picked up the phone and talked over 10 minutes..  Finally, I could not wait for her anymore and went to the queue for Normal Room.

The lobby looks crowded / bery busy though but its the gateway to the mall and to MRT station which makes it very accessible.         ",5,6/27/2023
Stayed here with the family for four nights and though not cheap it was very nice with a fantastic pool. Very busy hotel and the restaurants seemed very expensive though there are some great deals to be had when booking or surfing the internet. We managed to get buy one get one free for the breakfasts. Free wit as I would expect when paying theses prices. Book early for better discounts.,4,6/28/2023
"Very nice hotel with a wonderful swimming pool, worth to try it if you like resort/casino style hotel, not for relaxing but absolutely for fun.  Sky pool is a must to visit but don't expect to swim there, as most swimmers are there for photograph                     ",4,6/29/2023
"so, MBS has ben the talk of the year for its gran design, casino, the tenants in its adjacent  mall and has vast becoming the hip meeting point beside the regular ones, for god reasons. The pool in cloud alone is a magnet to all the guests, young and mature ones, the casino is, well, casino...while the room is ok, live up to its name and the service is very good. over all, a nice stay there",4,6/30/2023
"Postive: Impressive pool area (although too crowded), great view, friendly bell boys Negative: Way too impersonal, we did not feel as warm welcomed guests during our stay. The check in area has the charm of a ticket counter at a railway station. We first got a smoker room although we have explicitely requested a non smoker room. We found panties from our predecessors in the closet. One day we wanted to cross via the pool area from KuDeTa to our room in tower 1 a couple of minutes after 11pm but access was denied for us. We were asked to go all the way down to the hotel lobby, which is a big detour.",3,7/1/2023
"The Pool and views from the rooms of this hotel are fantastic, no one can deny that.   However when you pay the price you pay to stay at this Hotel you have expectations on how you are going to be treated. You don't pay $400+ per night and expect to have to line up in a queue to check in for 30 minutes. We did. I experienced shorter queues at Disneyland when i visited there.  You check in at 3pm and immediately go to the Pool for a swim. But at that time of day you can't get a sun lounge anywhere as they are covered in used towels. It is unclear whether the chairs are reserved or the previous user has been too lazy to take their towel with them when they were done. You would sit down on a chair but you are too worried that someone nearby taking a selfie might bite your head off.…",3,7/2/2023
"Very good place to have a rest. Convenient location, shopping mall is next, wonderful pool. The best thing is the great view from the balcony to the Gardens by the bay. Also its comfortable that you can walk there by the bridge which connected to the hotel.        ",5,7/3/2023
overall the experience was not that spectacular for the money spent would have expected more furniture given the size of the room  service is good and personnel kind and attentive close to a large choice of shops and restaurants,3,7/4/2023
"The bedroom is too small n the facilities are standard. Comparing the price with the condition of the bedroom was not a good valued. I've stayed in some hotels in Las Vegas are more valuable regarding the size, facilities and luxury.              ",3,7/5/2023
"Finally got to stay in this pricey but posh hotel in Aug. 14 during my vacation back from UK. Experience was overwhelming with great treatment from the Premium Services team of Mr. Yung Rui Yuan, Ryan and Ms. Ericca Tan who ensured that we have a very comfortable and enjoyable stay - made sure all our needs were attended to from check-in to check-out.  Our room was spacious and offers a great view of the city skyline and Esplanade. The infinity pool was the main attraction of my stay which I thoroughly enjoyed and spent most of my time, though crowded - probably testimony of its popularity. The whole complex offers all my needs during the stay with ample choices of food outlets and shopping, and will not hesitate for a return stay.",4,7/6/2023
"Just booked the basic room got a free upgrade at check in. Amazing views over the marina. The bed was so comfy we slept really well. Room is spotless. Room service was amazing, pricey but when your tired and hungry and it arrives on time and is delicious you don't care about the price. The pool is breath taking but very busy at the weekends. You have got to stay here just for a selfie in the infinity pool :) The gardens by the bay is right by the hotel and lovely to stroll around and stunning at night when it's all lit up. The hotel also has a huge shopping mall. Would recommend staying here, expensive but worth treating yourself. ",5,7/7/2023
"Don't expect to buy much but go for the views and photo ops. Check out the casino but bring your passport otherwise you will not get in. Go up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and see the sights from above. $23 for the elevator ride- pricey but when will you have the opportunity again. Don't buy the ridiculously priced photo for $50, but create your own memories with photos of you, your loved ones, selfies, or panorams of an amazing skyline.",4,7/8/2023
"My family and I planned to stay over at MBS to celebrate my dad's birthday. Upon heading up to the sky pool we were informed that entry is only restricted to 1card per adult.. Previously it was 1card for 2 guests. It's really disappointing as we were hoping that the family can visit the pool together which was why we booked this hotel in the first place. If we had knew rules like this have been implemented, might as well head over to RWSentosa where there's more attractions and amenities, and I'm sure there won't be rules like this for entry into their pool. For locals that's planning to stay at the hotel over the weekend, please look for other hotel. Or if your family consist of only 2person. ",1,7/9/2023
"Fantastic hotel!  Service, good, location, views..this resort has it all.  It is an iconic building & although a little more expensive than other top hotels, it is worth every cent!  We had access to a standard room & a club room & whilst the club room was double the size, I don't believe you need to spend that money to enjoy the resort.  The standard room is more then adequate!  You can use the ""Club Lounge"" facilities even when not in a club room! For $40-$50 pp you can enjoy cocktail hours etc & it is worth it!! ",5,7/10/2023
Marina Bay Sands is located in Bayfront Avenue and is one of most unique hospitality architecture in Singapore. Rooms are spacious with waterfront views along with botanical garden. MBS is easily accessible from Orchard Road and Changi Airport. Staff is courteous and has a superb infinity pool on the 57th Floor with 3 nice restaurants on the top. It is one of the best places to stay in the world.,5,7/11/2023
"This is hands down one of the swankiest places I’ve ever stayed in. My husband and I stayed in a Grand Club Room on the 52nd floor with floor-to-ceiling windows and amazing views of the city. The room was humongous, 850 square feet total… it was practically an apartment. The closet itself was almost as big as our room at the Porcelain Hotel in Chinatown.  By far, the best perk was being able to spend the day by that amazing infinity pool. There were plenty of lounge chairs around, and we were lucky enough to snag a couple right by the water. The best time to go to the pool is between 10am-3pm, when the sun is hottest and most other guests (who prefer not to tan) tend to stay indoors. And for those who like peace and quiet, there are specific areas of the pool where children are…",5,7/12/2023
"Had stay in the Orchid Suite at 53 Floor, so spacious that can I can't believe only for 2 person. THe suite provide huge bathroom, double basin and huge bathtub too. After all, MBS stucture itself are so huge that when the plane take off at Changi airport from such height I can still saw and recognize MBS like a giant door in Singapore coast line.  Every one stay in here must go the sky pool, I am not first time stayed in MBS and I love the view, enjoy the view more than really swim there. I trust other reviewer say more than enough about the the pool already.  I particularly like the laser show every night and its FREE. As a commercial hotel and casino, they willing to do this project I did respect, one memoral night is on the Earth Hour day. Excellent.  I also love the room…",4,7/13/2023
"This hotel is a must! The rooms are beautiful,spacious and very clean, the food is amazing and the infinity pool is fantastic.  Even if you don't stay in this hotel it's worth a visit just to experience the view from the infinity pool.",5,7/14/2023
"Great hotel, and lovely location, with all services you may need. It has spacious rooms and offers easy access to the Gardens by the bay and the Shoppes Mall. A bit pricy but worth the experience, specially the sky swimming pool.",5,7/15/2023

I do not write many reviews but really think that I should make an effort with this one.  I cannot think of any other hotel that I have been so disappointed with.  It is a large hotel with many rooms and for some added class we chose to pay more for their club rooms.  One for me and my partner and a second one for my partner's parents.  The whole experience started badly.  We had been informed that late checkout was available free for club members subject to availability.  As we had a late flight for three of us we requested that one of our two rooms have a late checkout.  We thought this was a reasonable request as it allowed at least one of our rooms to be available for cleaning early but then they tried to charge us a fee for this.  At some insistence we got one late check…,1,7/17/2023
"Marina Bay Sands is second to none for Singapore in terms of treatment of guests by the staff.  They are beyond courteous, go the extra mile in answering requests, and make the check-in and check-out experiences and everything in between a great pleasure.  ",5,7/18/2023
"We booked MBS for 4D/3N. It was the last 4 days of holidays after coming back from Borneo so we wanted to finish the holiday with something quite amazing and MBS definitely proved us to be pretty amazing. We booked a deluxe city view room, and at arrival we got upgraded to a grand club room with city view. The room was on the 53rd floor and had amazing views of the marina. The view of the sunset behind the financial district was really breathtaking. The most amazing thing tho was the infinity pool. You'll never encounter something like that anywhere. It was huge and the views from it were astonishing. We had to go there quite early to find a space as people were running to get a sun bed. Most of the beds actually looked empty but people were putting anything from a book to…",5,7/19/2023

"I went solely for the pool.  Now I had planned on leaving and doing some touristy sites (merlion, flyer, gardens by the bay) But that never happened.  I was quite content seeing those items from the comfort of the pool and jacuzzis.  I never found the pool crowded.  I really appreciated the separation of a family side and adult only side.  The room was comfortable.  Even on the 5th floor the view of the gardens was lovely.  The breakfast although an extra S$48 was well worth it--the variety was large.  The lobby is crowded and the lines for check-in/out can be excruciatingly long.  However I read a comment previously that made it easier--check-in as early as you can, the earlier the better.  I checked in at 6:15am.  The line was much shorter and I was given a temporary key card…",5,7/21/2023
"A great hotel with numerous of facilities. The rooftop and its pool is amazing. Staff were very polite and friendly. Especially when our daughter was getting sick and needed a doctor, we felt very lucky about how efficient and helpful they are.  But sometimes the hotel feels a little bit crowded and is lacking of some intimacy, considering hundreds of people, not hotel guests, coming to see the pool and rooftop everyday.",4,7/22/2023
"I had pinned the infinity pool multiple times-- It was what drove me to the Hotel (and Singapore for that matter)  I had high expectations and all of them were exceeded.  The room was comfortable. And the hotel was in great proximity to many of the touristy highlights (Gardens by the Bay, Flyer, Merlion, Esplanade, etc)  The breakfast option, although an additional fee was well worth it.  But oh the pool!  I had planned on going out to visit some of those touristy places, but once I stepped onto the 57th floor I never left.  I was quite content looking at them all from the luxury of the pool and jacuzzis.  Despite being the highlight of the hotel it was never overly crowded.  I was happy that the pool was divided allowing an adult only section; it made it much more enjoyable for…",5,7/23/2023
Marina bay sands is a landmark in itself now in Singapore. It is visible from a distance. Due to its architectural design it has a beautiful feeling. The lobby of the hotel is however a bit noisy as it is frequented by tourist and not only those staying in the premises. I had the pleasure of staying in the premises for about four days and it was a memorable stay. The view and the feeling of being in its infinite pool on the terrace is un-expressible in words.  The shopping complex next to the hotel and the Casino give you plenty of options.,5,7/24/2023
"Excellent service, stunning hotel, good food and of course the infinity pool. What a combination! We arrived two hours early for check in hoping to just leave our luggage but our room was ready so in addition to the helpful and pleasant check in staff, this was a good start. The view from the 35th floor room was superb and whilst the decor is not really to my taste, I could not fault the functionality and quality. We loved the infinity pool even though it was quite busy and with one exception could not fault the service or quality of food that we received. I would thoroughly recommend the buffet at Rise and the food/service at the the infinity alfresco bar but Ku De Ta was a disappointment as we sat for ages without the staff taking any notice of us. We waited so long that I…",5,7/25/2023
"This hotel is ridiculous! From the service, the food and bars its amazing! But obviously best of all the the sky pool and bar. When the elevator doors open it hits you in the face how crazy is it, it doesnt seem real when you are up there. But it is VERY expensive at this hotel. Your best off going across the water into the city to eat or shop it only takes 5 minutes. But everyone has to go there atleast once, its truely indescribable! ",5,7/26/2023

Also, The breakfast is confused, you need to choose a restaurant and they don't give you any orientation. The good things are the location, and also the great feeling of being on the most famous rooftop pool in the world! You should really go there at least one in a lifetime!",4,7/30/2023

Her smile radiates the hotel and she will make your stay extremely memorable. This hotel will more than surpass all of your expectations!",5,8/7/2023
"You are certainly IN if you stay at MBS, as they proudly call it there. While being the last cry of architectural tendencies and surely the local attraction, you might suffer a certain feeling of being too little and unimportant in this huge place.  While choosing a hotel in Singapore, I was wondering why such place does not deserve the highest score with the travelers, I now completely understand why.  It all started with the struggle to get my reservation confirmed (as I did it with one of those sites for reservations) and the transfer ordered. It all lasted at least 2 weeks while I was getting automatic messages like ""we like to give personal service, that is why you will have to wait for the answer"". I AM NOT EXAGGERATING. I still keep those messages and I do not know why.…",4,8/8/2023

"I was lucky somehow and got an upgrade, so my room was big and had a huge bathroom and a great view. I also got some complementary services and I felt really good. The pool, of course, was one of the main attraction, but also the shopping area outside and the gardens. The only problem is that there is no place where you can have a quiet moment. The hotel, the mall, the lobby, the pool, the rooftop are full with people of all kinds. But for one weekend anyone can manage.",5,8/10/2023
"Second time we have stayed in this hotel and the experience was non-the less incredible. The view from the pool in the Skypark is an amazing and unique experience; especially at night. The staff around the pool were very tentative, the cocktails are some of the best we've had and the snack food is a good price and tasty.   We stayed in a Deluxe room this time instead of a Premier room. The Deluxe rooms are a good size, clean and modern - no complaints, however, the Premier rooms are much larger, better designed and probably worth paying the extra. The garden view is still nice and it was worth saving the money (since we have previously had a city view room, although city view is nicer).   Hotel reception is still very busy and you may have to wait to check in and out. We would…",5,8/11/2023

We had a premier double room which was a very good size with a view overlooking the expensive gardens to the rear. Bathroom was very clean with separate shower and wc rooms as well as a gigantic bath tub. There is an extensive room service menu also avaliable if you choose to use.

Everything was good throughout the stay, until the next morning. The club room is inclusive of breakfast for 2, we invited 2 of our friends to come over for breakfast.

"Yes, this is a grand hotel! Too grand maybe... A"" must taste"" for sure, but one night was enough for us: Too many people! That somehow kills the concept of luxury... The hall looks like a (beautiful)  airport hall, or worse a busy (luxury) train station. The rooms are great, and the view is stunning, as long as you ask for (and get) an elevated floor. Restaurants are fin, but lack atmosphere in my view. So here comes the actual reason for being here: the pool! Long, so long, an infinity pool on top of the Singapore planet, so high... The other side of the medal is: Busy, damn busy! I tried it early in the morning, busy, during the day, busy, at sunset, crowded... Don't even think to swim there.

Despite being promoted as one of the 'must-go' hotel in Singapore, the poor experience was consistent from start till the end!   a.

They even helped us out with the one beyond their control, so well done hotel management.

We enjoyed a few drinks (not at all cheap but for where you were you just swallowed the cost) and stayed into the night. It gets very breezy and cold so I very much recommend a pullover or something to keep you warm. The room itself was lovely, what you'd expect for a hotel of its class.

Checked in on a Saturday afternoon and stayed for two nights. When I arrived on Saturday, I was expecting the worse as I saw quite a line at the check-in counter. However, I was pleasantly surpised how quickly the check-ins were processed.  Maybe it was my lucky day, but I was very grateful to be in my room in less than 20 minutes. The staff is very courteous and professional. The room was average for the price, but the hotel itself fulfilled all my entertainment needs. Great restaurants, but expensive. Luckily I was prepared to splurge after saving up for a year. The view from Ku De Ta on the roof is magnificient at night. The…",5,9/1/2023
"This hotel is just beyond AMAZING! From beginning to end, the service was just incredible. The hotel just looks beautiful and location is great! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an absolute treat. We had a club suite facing the city, the view is to die for!! we stayed here 1 night / 2 days but i could have stayed here forever. The view from the sky bar is on the 57th floor, you will be breathless when the doors open from the lift, its like opening the door to heaven! We also dined at their restaurant Ku De Ta, which was wonderful with a breath taking view with the city lit up shining like little stars. Overall rating is 10/10!!       ",5,9/2/2023
"The hotel is somewhat overwhelming in size and you get an immediate sense that the personal touch will be missing. Concierge and porter staff were friendly, queries placed with express services were promptly answered, but a connection was not there. The service is robotic, I felt like I was just another one of their 2,500 clients staying the night. To be fair the views from the Sky Park and pool are amazing and Ku de Ta was great for fine dining. If you're the type of person that likes personalised service then this is not the place for you. If you like mega concerts and are happy to be just another face in the crowd then you'll love this place.",3,9/3/2023
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights have 2 nights in village chenghi hotel (much more local) marina bay was beautiful and definitely a site to see while in Singapore but I don't think I needed anymore than 1-2 night here. There are way too many people coming in and out and to get back to the hotel from the Bay Area and the shopping mall is very confusing. Seems too much of a tourist attraction for us for what we paid for. The pool was extremely crowded and loud and there was barely any staff there to service your from the little menu they have. The pool defiantly doesn't accommodate all the people that stay there. The pool is only good for the view pictures and then it's useless since you can barely swim in it. Breakfast was very good though! Had many options from all…,4,9/4/2023
After seeing the pictures I was excited to be spending 4 nights here. It was a all that I expected ! The pool deck is lovely and view spectacular. Go early morning or midday to pool to avoid crowds. Room was nice but very much same as all 5 star rooms. We were on 10th floor and our friends on 48th so try get higher room for better view. Food and drinks pricey but that is the case in Singapore anyway. We made use of our full duty free allowance and would advise others to do the same. Shopping in the attached centre was very good ,5,9/5/2023
"The hotel is easy on the eye both in and out.  Breakfast was really well catered for, plenty of seating and plenty of variety.  Although the price range is outside my range I found a number of eateries, clothing stores in and out of the hotel that were more affordable.  There are a number of food stalls about 10 minute walk from the hotel (heading over the colourful bridge... name escapes me) and along the water (10-15 minute walk).  Down stairs in the hotel there is some really taste Indian food as well.",5,9/6/2023
"With a great view and fantastic location. Service is fantastic and the pool is simply superb. The room is not as fancy as you would expect, it' pretty basic but big. For that price you would expect at least the breakfast included. An icon in Singapura!",5,9/7/2023
"Choose higher rooms for a better view. Rooms are extremely spacious, staff is welcoming. Still the hotel seemed a bit crowdy.  Better to visit the pool in the morning to escape lots of people. Book KuDeTa in advance!        ",5,9/8/2023
"We stayed here for three nights on the 42nd floor and the room given to us is perfect with its enchanting view of Gardens by the Bay!. The room is just perfect for me and my husband, a bit huge compared to the other rooms on the lower floor. It has king size bed, clean and huge bathroom. The room has small fridge, flat tv, a couch and small balcony. It has large built in cabinet with iron, vaults, sleepers, and hangers. Wifi is free. However, the room is just so ordinary just like any other hotel in our past trips. Actually, carpet looks dull and old. The couch doesnt compliment the color of the wall nor the bedsheets. The bed though king size is plain just the white blanket and 4 pillows nothing fabulous or accesories to look impressive considering we paid almost $500 per night…",4,9/9/2023
It is an experience on its own. If you visit singapore consider staying here simply to experience something truly special if you can afford it that is. I was lucky to be part of a company paid conference but would strongly recommend it even though it is expensive. Its probably worth the money but who am I to say that!,5,9/10/2023
"It's great experience in my life when i have a chance to go on boat floor, 56th of Marina Bay Sands. It's my dream place in my life to go. The sunset view made me and my friends impressed and memorable for whole life!! 360 degree Singapore view over there was amazing. Best place to see sunset in Singapore surrounded with lively bar and exotic restaurant on 57th floor. The 23 SGD for observation deck is valuable with our great experience at the sophisticate hotel.  Will be impressed for my whole life !!!! Love Marina Bay Sands !!!!!",5,9/11/2023
"Stayed a night here, spacious room, nice and comfy but how i wish there is a bathtub for deluxe room.   More reception desk for check in and out is preferred. Too long queue and waiting time.  Pool is amazing (yes of course i only came here for the pool) but crowded yet still supply enough towel for all the guests (i like)   Bad experience at MBS: i forgot my blanket in the room. Next day i call back and check on them 3 times yet they can not find it. I do not get it, house keeper should be cleaning and making the room for next guest right, and my blanket is big, not a towel, how they can not see it. House keeping dept of the hotel should be looking at this problem. I am surprised that i forgot a blanket at 5 star hotel means i lost it forever.",4,9/12/2023
"This is the hotel to go for a long wekend in Singapore. Perfect for a couple to go away to see the sights..do the night life and stay at one of the most iconic buildings in the world. It has everything from  brunches for a set price ...Spa's..massive shopping mall...casino... the coolest bars with the best views...restaurants ( expensive ) ...and of course the infamous infinity pool. The pool is fantastic....however it is ALWAYS BUSY...period ! ...All the sun beds are crammed in ...no personal space and the place is a posers dream ! Forget a peaceful relaxing time by a pool admiring the view. You wont get it here. The hotel is a marvel. Connects directly to the Gardens by the Bay , a huge mall with every conceivable shop, the casino ,  Avalon night club plus the world famous and…",4,9/13/2023
Great stay!  Excellent wine list!  Amazing place and warm people.  Definitely we will come back!.  Very good restaurant with delicious food and very good and extensive wine list.  Very attentions reception and great service!,5,9/14/2023
"We were lucky to get a room for 2 nights at a discounted rate. We had the 34th Floor which is the link to the Sky Pool and Park. The view is fantastic as we looked out to the Gardens. There is plenty to see and do just within the premises as it's a casino hotel. There is a theater, a hugh shopping mall, lots of restaurants, a food court, a museum and a night club all in the same vicinity. Everything is more expensive, so you might want to go outside of the area which is accessible by the subway called the MRT. The Sky Pool is fun and has a adult section. The Sky Park has some great views of the city day and night. The Gardens is worth a visit.",5,9/15/2023
This hotel is really something. We stayed in the 16th floor and the view was amazing. Hotel location is good and it is easy to visit and see the rest of the Singapore with the metro. The pool at the top is amazing!! The gym is small but the view is nice. Maybe this is not the best place in Singapore but must see anyway. The first floor of the hotel was busy but the room was very quiet.,4,9/16/2023
"We booked 2 x Premier rooms. Upon check in, they advised they have upgraded our rooms to be in Tower 3, one room on level 34 and the other on level 50. It was okay the rooms weren't both on the same floor - an upgrade is better than no upgrade! Both rooms had amazing views and the interior of the room is just beautiful. I loved the bathroom especially.  The only issue we had was that the room on level 50 smelt badly of chlorine. We assume this was because the infinity pool was on level 57.       ",4,9/17/2023
"If there is one thing you must do in Singapore, it is treat yourself to at least 1 night at this Hotel. Here you will experience the highest class treatment and have the best seat to the view of Singapore from the poolside. I will definitely stay here again.",5,9/18/2023
"There's no doubt that it's a stunning property but the hotel felt very impersonal. The hotel staff lacked warmth and just didn't really care who came and went, something unacceptable for a 5* hotel. The room was wonderful but the toiletries  look and feel cheap — again, unacceptable from a 5* property. The infinity pool, although sensational, was far too crowded to take in the experience — also, the slow service from the poolside staff didn't help matters. I stayed here out of curiosity and was thoroughly disappointed — it was a rather unforgettable stay. If you have stayed at any of the Taj or Oberoi properties in India and kinda expect that sort of service and warmth, be warned. ",3,9/19/2023
"1. The air conditioner flow was very poor. In the first room i was allotted (t2 771), the room temperature refused to go below 27c even though the air con was set at 18c with high fan speed. Eventhough i was alloted another room, the situation did not improve much.   2. When i was shifted from first room to the second room, i misplaced a few items as it was at 1.30AM and i was very sleepy. However, when the staff cleaned the room, they did not think to ask me before throwing away several important photographs which I had kept on the stand beside the bed. As some of them were the only copies that I had, I'm really upset. There was also a blanket that I had I left behind but that can be replaced. Surely the housekeeping staff should have realised that really old photos of children…",1,9/20/2023
"Impressive Hotel, good for 1st time visitors to Singapore, good location you will be amazed. Shopping area just in front of the Hotel, good restaurants, a bit artificial , so do not expect a cosy Hotel              ",5,9/21/2023
I can say that our overall stay was good. The infinity pool on the skypark is great. I you are planning for a swim I suggest take a brunch and go there around lunchtime to enjoy it as it gets crowded later on.       ,4,9/22/2023
"Although not cheap this hotel is excellent both with service, spacious rooms and ambience Excellent proximity to one of Singapore's latest attraction Gardens by the bay although not easy to access from the hotel until you have returned over the footbridge. The rooftop infinity pool is breathtaking although very crowded at times. Worth the extra to upgrade to Club room or better to gain access to the Club on the 57 floor which entitles you to morning and afternoon tea and the canapé and cocktail hour at which many consume the evening meal. The restaurants and bars are not cheap and the casino adjoins. A little way from the shopping precinct but depends on what you are in Singapore for",5,9/23/2023
Checked in for conference.  Offered room on lower floor (2nd level of accommodation in tower 3) with what was described as a view of the gardens and excellent balcony.  Unfortunately the hotel sits next to a busy motorway so balcony is useless (and as it turns out no better than upper levels).  Road noise was noticable and view not great. To the hotel's credit they did move us the next day (though not a streamlined process) and our second room was much better.  Good views esp of the garden light show. Pool was amazing though can get busy and need to be quick to get a seat. Overall a pleasant stay but not sure if would stay there again unless compelling reason.,4,9/24/2023
"The shopping centre is a waste of time. Take the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, put 6 extra floors on filled with designer stores with security guards. All the shops as the same as the other 20 malls on Orchard Road. I lost the will to live within 5 minutes. The hotel is grotesque. Three towers with a surfboard on top. A testament to the power of money, marketing and the need to produce something 'unique'. Daft. The view is wonderful from the top mind.",3,9/25/2023
"My kids insisted on staying at the MBS, mainly due to the infinity pool that they heard from their friends.  The lobby felt like a busy train station with so many tourists from China.  Staffs are inevitably busy, so service felt cold, impersonal and rushed.  Room was extremely spacious, but nothing really special.  The infinity pool was worth visiting just to take a snap shot that declares your visit.  I had hoped for a serene ambience and a spectacular view at the pool area, but it was too crowded and noisy.  Overall, I would only recommend the hotel to casino guests.",3,9/26/2023
"It's exactly what everyone else here says: Not the best hotel I've ever seen, even cheap furnishings in the room. I thought offering cheap instant powder coffee creamer in the rooms for the price I paid per night was downright cheeky. I get real milk in the cheap 'Days In'-hotel I am at now. The check-in is like you're going to buy a ticket for something- not personal. The lobby decor is just 'good', by no means excellent. Looking at the reception decor, my first thoughts were 'guess they ran out of money here'...- could have been done by high school students. Such a shame as well that my bed was at the other end of the big room so could not enjoy the great views from there. It started raining badly when I got there so was sad to see my pool experience wash away but glad to see…",4,9/27/2023
