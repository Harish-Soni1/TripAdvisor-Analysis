"i visited marina bay sands in the easter holiday with my 3 kids we took 2 suits in the middle tower on the 5th floor the view was breath taking regarding the hotel:  location : more than fantastic in the city with a big mall walking distance from the hotel  rooms: the marina suit more than amaizing large clean nice , wonrdeful furniture nothing negative at all   the staff : friendly helpful   the hotel should be visit when you visit singapore an amazing experience",5,
"A tourist spot itself and a highlight of any person traveling in Singapore.It looks amazing inside and out and of course everyone goes there for the ""cherry on top"".Check in (with early time) and check out went smooth, no waiting time at all.Room booked was with city view, spacious, clean.Plenty of places to go shopping, eat, gamble, etc.Staff very friendly and try to attend to your every need.It's the place fully packed?Yes!So even if you're looking for something more luxurious, be prepared for a lot of crowds.Is it worth it?in my opinion yes, but not twice",5,
"I don't think I'm unique. I saw a picture of the pool somewhere and said ""I must swim there!"" I had an opportunity for a layover in Singapore recently and I decided to go all out and splurge on a few nights at MBS. It was a bucket list hotel for me, and I am glad I did it, but not sure that I would repeat.  The room was spectacular. We had a city view room on floor 47. It had a huge bathroom with tub, a sitting area, and all the amenities and power ports you would ever need. The bed was comfy, and the room was quiet. Everything was very clean and we were met daily with a cute towel animal left by our housekeeper.   We booked the club package which was nice. It included daily breakfast at one of 4 restaurants, or in the room, afternoon tea at Club 55, and a daily happy hour with…",4,
"Terrible hotel.  I had to wait over in the long queue over an hour just to check in.  Check-in time 3pm but when we were finally greeted by front desk receptionist, it was already close to 4:30pm!! And they have no sofa or chairs for guests to sit while waiting? Usually in a renowned hotel such as Hilton or Hyatt, if a guest had to wait over an hour just to check in, they'd politely apologize and let you wait at a bar with complimentary drinks.  But this hotel didn't offer anything like that! My family was really tired waiting around for close to 1 1/2 hours. When my small children started running around because they were too bored and tired, the concierge gave us really nasty looks.  On top of that, bell boys couldn't even bother to take and keep your luggage while waiting, so…",1,
"There are many places to stay in Singapore, but if you think that you may not be back, splurge and experience the iconic Marina Bay Sands. What Singapore skyline picture have you seen without featuring this hotel? Not only will you find the service and accommodations excellent, but the views are spectacular.The stay wouldn't be complete without a dip in the infinity pool on the 57 floor. The water can be a little chilly, but you'll get used to it! Just to make it easy and inclusive, we booked for access to Club 55. It has great food and crispy bacon! The hotel is in the middle of all of the night action. A night stroll around the lake will get you to most of the great spots, plus you will be 'front & center' for the spectacular light show. That is happening in front on the lake…",5,
"So I must say we were very disappointed with our visit at the Marina Bay Sands. Don’t get me wrong the place is stoning and the room is amazing! However as soon as you step out of your room and go to the rooftop or the Club 55 lounge you realize that you are not that special or that the Luxus experience you were looking for doesn’t exists! Let’s be honest here, you booked this place because you wanted to feel expensive and luxurious! Well let me tell you, you don’t feel that way! You feel you are those kind of people that booked a deal on Expedia to go to a all inclusive trip!   Your stayed here is shared with the other other 2500 guest (or even more) that came here for the exact same expectation of experience! The problem is, we booked the Club room expecting to feel more…",3,
"We stayed at the MBS hotel for 3 nights on a second visit to Singapore . This hotel is very large 2,560 rooms so you could expect some service to be stretched . We checked in reasonably quick . The city view room was spacious , high quality , clean , good view . Bathroom was very large , with large walk in shower . Service at the hotel was generally good . The location is brilliant for high end shopping and right by the metro and hence easy access to the rest of this city . There were a good selection of restaurants to suit different tastes and budgets . The casino is also a good addition to the hotel . The swimming pool on the 57th rooftop floor is very large with an excellent view over Singapore . Ideal for photos of the city . My only issue with the pool area was the fact…",5,
"My wife and I checked into a harbour view room, the check in process was very time consuming and not efficient which was not a good first impression.  The room was OK and just OK,  After our research our expectation was far higher than experienced.",3,
"As first time visitors to Singapore mid April 2018 we were a family of four (including 2 teens) elected to splash out and stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands (MBS) for 4 nights in twin rooms on level 35. Our flight from Australia landed early Friday morning so we arrived at the hotel around 8am, despite this we were allowed to check in to our rooms immediately for no additional cost which was exceptional service considering how much you could pay elsewhere for an early check in at this time of day.    Really happy with the rooms and the view. We loved the big bathrooms and separate toilet and showers with own doors its a much better setup than most other similar hotels, the room fit out was classy and was exceptionally cleaned throughout our stay.  The views straight out the…",5,
This is a massive and very expensive hotel that failed me with its awarding winning service it claims to provide! The best part of my 3 day stay was leaving this hotel knowing I will NEVER return!   From the moment I arrived to when I checked out I had issues that the hotel would not resolve.  I had very poor service throughout my stay!   Arrived after midnight to long queues to check in - it was like a rush hour on the London tubes - not enough staff to check folk in - frankly this is unacceptable when you are paying top dollar to stay here!   I then had to get fit carrying my heavy bags to my room.   Went to the bar on top floor and got  incredibly very poor service! Not impressed! This was the last thing I needed after a long flight! After this experience I went outside the…,1,
This hotel belongs to the iconic buildings in Singapore. On the rooftop you find cool restaurants like kudeta and also a place to take a swim ( although you need to have booked a room ) in the basement you find a casino,3,
"lots to do here, many good (albeit pricey) restaurants & bars here, as well as shopping. if you are driving, would be good to check with the establishments you patronize if they provide complimentary parking coupons.",5,
"No words to describe the spectacular hotel with a master suite for honeymooners.....  flowers, champagne, music.  Great restaurants, fantastic infinity pool and couple joint massage. Singapore was a fantastic place for lovers!",5,
"Stayed for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday, informed Hotel but got no special touches like you would in a smaller hotel. Rooms are ok, but nothing great for what you pay, but your really paying for the infinity pool and it’s reputation.  Reception staff took $400 deposit and informed me it would take 2-4 weeks to deposit back into my account ? Don’t know why it would take that long?  Breakfast was mediocre, had better. Even so Would still recommend you stay here as a great experience.",4,
"Great location, there are quite a few attractions nearby. The rooms, especially the suites, are very nice. Best views of the city. There are lots of things to do: the mall is pretty big, many nice restaurants, the casino is nice too. What the hotel is most famous for, I believe, is the swimming pool at the top. I'm not a fan of swimming pools in general but I like the atmosphere and the view up there. It is usually crowded with people taking selfies and blocking your way though :P",5,
"I actually wanted to stay at Marina Bay Sands during my 3D2N trip in April, for a chance to try out that amazing pool on the rooftop but due to a small company-provided budget, this has to be for another time... And ended up at some cheapie hotel in Geylang instead! :)  Still, a trip to Singapore is not completed without a visit to MBS and this I did on my first night here... And while I reached the place kinda late after 2230 hrs, when most of the shops were already closed, I had to go to the Casino and try my luck at the Roulette tables, my usual routine when entering any such gambling venue (and actually won a reasonable sum of money thanks to the little ball landing on my preferred numbers several times, good stroke of luck)! XD",5,
Great pool with sensational views a eonderful place to sip cocktails.Excellent size room with fabulous city views. Food was good with great breakfast location on level 57. Staff were very helpful. Would definitely stay again.,5,
"Highly recommend!!! Even though the hotel is pretty expensive, it is a once in a lifetime experience (and it was a bucket list item for me :) So it is worth the money. There is so much to do and see, you don't even need to leave the hotel! Enjoy the pool for as long as you can because the view is absolutely incredible.",5,
We were upgraded to a deluxe room for my partners 70th birthday & there was a birthday cake & a bottle of wine waiting in our room to celebrate. We were on the 39th floor overlooking the Marine Bay Gardens & the ocean - it was stunning!!! The roof top pool was a great experience- remember to take your phone to take a selfie!!! It was a little expensive but worth it for a special occasion & in a perfect location to get around to see everything.,4,
"The hotel is stunning.   We stayed here specifically because you cannot access the infinity pool unless you are a guest.  Yes it is expensive but if you are in Singapore once in your life it's definitely worth it!    Room We stayed in a garden view room.  The room was spacious and had a balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay.  The balcony was large enough to have a table, couch, and 2 additional seats.    We were able to view the daily supertree light and sound show right from the balcony.  Access to Gardens by the Bay The hotel has direct access to the gardens via a walkway.  You may need to exit the hotel and take a separate elevator up to the 6th floor to access the walkway.    Infinity Pool The pool lives up to the hype.    It is amazing to swim right up to the edge and…",5,
"The rooms are good! Service is good! breakfast is good!   One of the person in charge noted we travel with infant and seemed to walk a long way to get to their hotel; with no delay, he directed us to get our room check in process done at VIP area!!!  VIP area means no long queue. That seriously helped a lot.  Appreciate for his observation.      Our rooms were ready to get check in by 4:30pm, which was just about 10mins of check in process.  There was an event on during our stay and the normal check in counter for public is filled with people.    In house guest is advise to spend a bit of time hanging at their swimming pool at roof top!  One down point to it is one key card for one in house guest to enter to that area.  Hence, please make sure, EVERYONE bring along your key card…",5,
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands fro 4 nights while on business.  Both the room and the service were excellent.   My room included breakfast, which I had on the roof top every morning.  The selection and quality of the breakfast was outstanding.  The pool on the 57th floor can't be missed.  The attached mall was a bit too high end for my taste (Gucci, Prada, etc.), but lots of other shopping nearby.  Wonderful place to stay.",5,
It's ine of Singapore best attractions. Entertainment shopping food cinema hotel bar sky views and more. At least half a day is needed here to enjoy what it has to offer. Make sure you got room in your credit card or bring lots if cash if you plan on shopping. All high end stores here. Enjoy.  ,5,
We stayed for 2 nights in The Marina Bay Sands with a garden view. Stunning. The staff were lovely and the room clean and modern. The pool and sun deck are a real treat to relax in at the very top of the hotel with amazing views.,5,
"Enjoyed 5 nights at this iconic hotel ... it is so huge nowhere within the hotel lobby to sit and relax it really is more like an airport . Every designer shop available ..  the mrt station is great and easy to use we began with using taxis but soon got the hang of the mrt and it's so cheap to use.  Our room was lovely ... You need to book a high floor, pool is beautiful we never found it to be to busy and neither did we find the water cold.  The food and drinks around the pool were good value for money ... also we really enjoyed breakfast there  relaxing and great choice too. Enjoy your stay we did  missing it now. ",5,
"We visited Marina Bay Sands for 3 Nights and had King Club.  I had always to to stay here as iconic and where else if coming to Singapore.  Hotel was nice, room was also great.   Roof Top Bar/Club was also the best that we went to in Singapore.  Points to Consider:  - Check in was very crowded, “Club” Check In was not overly clear and someone approached us after being in the Queuing for a while - then took us to the Club Check in Room. - We did get a nice welcome (after being taken to Club) and complimentary early check-in. - City View is better. - Relatively Expensive, but worth it for quick visit to experience. - Little out of the main city, no problem getting cabs though/walk into the city/China Town is nice. - Pool was amazing but very very very crowded and we struggled to…",4,
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The roof top pool is stunning and one of the best features of the hotel. Rooms are nice a spacious, twice cleaned by the staff. Location is excellent, near Marina Bay. ",5,

"Having been to Singapore a number of times and staying in some lovely hotels we thought it was time to stay in the Iconic Marina Bay Sands. It certainly is very impressive and if you want a quiet low key hotel,this definitely isn't the place to stay but set in the most perfect position for sight seeing. We had rather a wait to register for our room as  this is such a busy hotel but the hardworking receptionist did her best at a very busy time of many guests arriving. I  would say that we were both slightly disappointed on seeing our room,it was quite simple but very clean as we would have expected from this hotel. After staying at other well known hotels especially in the Middle East where we previously lived, this was rather a surprise. We had a small supply of toiletries…",4,
"Attended the Epicurean Market last year and had been trying to organise a trip for my students this year, but not getting any luck with securing this year’s dates. So a colleague and I decided to visit MBS personally to try to get the info while we’re in town for FHA. Truly impressed, from a professional standpoint of a hospitality lecturer, with the concierge at the mall & at the expo, and bartender and manager @ Adrift & Yard Bird. Going beyond expectations seems to be the standard at MBS as they patiently attended to all my inquiries, and the slight mention of something, they’ll think of something more to provide, be it additional info, bottled water, a drink we tasted at the masterclass during last year’s epicurean market, curiosity about bourbon flights, etc! Amazing…",5,
We stayed for 3 nights in a Premier King Sky View room on Level 45 facing the river across the city and distant hills.  Each evening we could see the light show on the river from our room.  The hotel is enormous however it is run incredibly well. The staff are friendly and attentive. Our room was large and very comfortable and room service was good and efficient. The facilities are of a high standard. The iconic rooftop pool is amazing and while quite crowded we did manage some time early on our last morning.  The bars and restaurants are great and the shopping mall is massive.  Mostly high end and we did also venture to Orchard Rd which was really a waste of time as everything there is at Marina Bay Sands for the same price.  The humidity in Singapore was overwhelming so it was…,5,
Infinity pool is just amazing and so is the overall experience. We enjoyed the Spectra show from our room. Super smooth check-in and check-out process. Club room guests receive a VIP treatment during check-in too. Upgrading to Club room was worth the money. Huge room with bath tub and shower area. Free access to infinity pool and observatory area. Club room also includes High Tea and cocktails for 2 guests.,5,
We stayed one evening to celebrate my daughters birthday.  Our room was very nice overlooking the gardens.  I like the fact that the curtains opened automatically when you put in the key card giving it the wow factor.  We had three beds so it was a bit of a squeeze but it was functional.  The hotel is enormous with the three towers and shopping centre so it did feel impersonal and almost like a railway station in reception with so many people moving around.  The best bit of course is the rooftop pool.  We spent all afternoon till sunset there.  It does get busy everyone wanting photo opportunities but there are plenty of sun loungers.  It was rather rowdy the day we visited with a large group of Americans who were drinking beer all day.  They were constantly reminded not to take…,4,
"My friend and I were only staying for one night in Singapore before going on a cruise. We decided to push the boat out and stay at this architectural masterpiece. Despite it being pricey, we were not disappointed. The rooms are beautifully appointed, the level of service is second to none and the view from the infinity pool over the City is just spectacular. We had a relaxing day at the infinity pool on the roof and a word of warning, if you are not a guest in the hotel, don’t try and take a sneak peak because it is strictly for hotel guests only and you need your room card to go through the barrier. Up on the roof pool, there are two restaurants serving light or full meals. This pool is 150 meters long, making it the longest hotel pool in the World. They supply you with towels…",5,
It was an absolute pleasure to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. We got upgraded to a city view. The room was very clean and welcoming. The hotel offers a wide arrange of restaurants and boutiques. The cocktail bar at the top floor is first class. Tthe view of the gardens from the bar is stunning. Can't wait to stay here again!,5,
"MBS is the icon of Singapore by now without a doubt. From its unique design to world famous pool this hotel is heaven for any instagram addict. The rooms are quite plain, nothing fancy, prices are at luxury level but rooms fit out and amenities are not at that level. Service is very good, very friendly employees that know what they are doing. The view from the room is simply spectacular, in line with hotels in HK that have a view of HK island. The pool is always packed and no wonder it is world famous, the view is more than amazing. Overall the hotel doesn't disappoint and is a great place to stay. In addition to the pool there is of course the casino, the shoppes and many eateries, a great destination to simply enjoy life.",4,
"The city night view was something like have never experienced before. The bathroom was amazing with a separate shower, toilet and stand alone bath with stunning views over to the Gardens by the Bay.  This was an extremely comfortable room with a lounge and dining area . The pool is as impressive as expected but the water was a bit cold.",4,
"We couldn't stop over in Singapore without a stay at the iconic MBS. We had booked two nights some months ago through our UK travel agent but upgraded to a larger room higher up tower 1 (level 48) with a garden view, on check in. The room was enormous with a balcony overlooking Gardens on the Bay and the sea. The bathroom was huge and extremely well appointed. Breakfast was included in our deal and we had a choice of venue but we chose to eat in Rise, in the lobby area of tower 1. As to be expected, breakfast was a busy affair but well organised. We noted large queues waiting to be seated as we had finished but we were not kept waiting. The food was a self service buffet and was plentiful. Every possible diet and preference must have been catered for! The hotel is well placed…",5,
Bucket list hotel Glad we stayed - the pool is stunning and the views worth every penny. Room was average for the price but the room service was really good - great proximity to gardens by the bay - the guard at the pool was awesome and knowledgeable ,4,
This hotel is the brand of the city becayse of the pool.the view on top of it is amazing.the rooftop pool and the bars there are so fancy.if u go all the way to singapore book at least 1 2 nights there u will not regret it.the room service was good.the hotel is always busy.the views of the rooms are great nomatter on which side u are.is just majestic.it made our vacation worth all the effort of flying all the way there,5,
"I was hesitant at first because I was already happy with a hotel with a small price to pay but I was amazed on the ambiance and beauty of the hotel. The room was really nice and roomy. The view was exceptional and just relaxing to look at day and night. The infinity pool was truly a one of a kind experience, it's a way to see singapore in a really different way. No regrets on checking in this place and surely I will be back here with my family. What I really loved about my stay was the staff. Everyone was very hospitable and very easy to talk to. I would like to specify my Edgardo Reyes. He assisted us all the way and was really welcoming. He was able to address to all our questions with ease and in a customer friendly way. Will really look forward to coming back and Mr. Edgardo…",5,
Pool was amazing and excellent rooms and facilities.  Definitely a must see when in Singapore. Would stay here again. Very central to lots of attractions.  Staff very helpful although no early check in available when arriving from long haul early morning flights.,5,
"Stayed at the MBS for 6 nights in January 2018. Business trip. Check-in was quick and efficient. I was in a premier King garden view room and it was extremely good. Plenty of storage, good sized work area, bathroom wanted for nothing. No problems with the safe, free wi-fi worked perfectly. I was on the 24th floor and the views over the bay were magnificent. Only downside was the unusually cold wet weather even for Singapore. Room was cleaned spotlessly everyday, any towels used were replaced as were any toiletries. Bed was very comfortable.  Had breakfast in the Rise. 1st class food and the choice was endless. Service was excellent. Used Spago for evening cocktails while enjoying the Singapore skyline. Try the peace on earth. Staff very attentive and enjoyed watching them create…",5,
This is a Must stay place if you are in Singapore. It is different to other luxuries.Service is excellent could not fault any.Pool and the view from it is spectacular.Its architecture is uncommon and unique.  We arrived early from Auckland and did not expect to get our room at 9.30 AM. A must mention check in staff LUCY went the extra mile to make sure we got into our room asap. She was very friendly lovely and very professional,5,
"Rooms were very luxurious, big, clean and with plenty of amenities. The hotel is very big, it is not a classic hotel and it feels more like an airport terminal. The infinity pool is beautiful but the atmosphere there can be quite pretentious, especially in the evening. Most people go there to take selfies rather than enjoy relaxing at the pool.",4,
"We had an absolutely amazing 4 night stay at Marina Bay Sands.  We arrived very early (6am) and although our room wasn't quite ready (understandable at that time in the morning), they were happy that we enjoyed full use of the facilities until we received an email to advise our room was ready and boy was it worth waiting for........stunning Grand Club Room on 42nd floor which was huge and very well appointed/decorated.  We were not disappointed with our choice of hotel or choice of room....well worth the extra cost.  We preferred breakfast in Adrift as Rise was far noisier and busier.  Club 55 staff were absolutely delightful and made us feel very special every time we visited.  Service there was faultless and there was a wonderful selection of food and drinks available. …",5,
"A must stay – for one night!  Upon arriving at the hotel it’s slightly disappointing that a porter doesn’t come to collect your luggage – I expect such service when a hotel costs so much. You then have to queue up to checkin and it feels like an airport rather than a hotel, however whilst waiting in the queue they do offer you some snacks/drinks which is nice.   The service/staff – all absolutely incredible, very friendly and know there stuff inside out. From the check in staff to the barman each and every person we spoke to was really nice. Special mention goes to Swathi at the concierge who was really friendly and helpful.    Location – the BEST location place in Singapore.   Restaurants/Bars – everything was 10/10   Infinity Pool – the reason most people seem to stay at the…",4,
"Could not get enough of that pool. Beautiful at all times of day. We had a great room, garden view on 33 floor. Service and food excellent. But we stayed just one night just to enjoy the pool. Totally worth it.",5,
"I have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel in November 2016, November 2017, and February 2018.   From the moment you see this hotel across the bay as you come into Singapore city from the airport, you get this odd feeling that you are about to have the experience of a lifetime. It is of course no joke that Singapore is called the Dubai of Asia, but lets be honest Singapore is MUCH MUCH BETTER.   This hotel is built with three towers and a huge boat on top that has a infinity pool which will provide you the view of a lifetime, and not to mention those instagram pictures that will make the world jealous that you get to stay at the hotel designed for the rich of Asia.   The restaurants are a bit overrated to be honest with you, but from the moment you walk into the hotel, the…",5,
"Marina bay sands did not disappoint. The whole stay was pretty incredible. We stayed in a club room which allowed us free access to club 55 for breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. We found that the hors d’oeuvres at happy hour were substantial enough that we didn’t need dinner, and both food and drinks were complementary (with a club room), which made the stay good value. Our room was spacious and luxurious with an incredible view of the city - especially stunning at night. The pool was absolutely amazing and we didn’t want to leave. Service on all levels- room attendant, check in, check out was superb. If you get and opportunity to stay here, do it! Just incredible ",5,
"Without doubt this is a stunning hotel. It’s huuuuuuuge. I can’t really fault it but having been looking forward to this after a mini tour of South East Asia staying in mid range hotels, this wasn’t my favourite.  The pool is packed day and night and really is just a case of get in have the pic taken then get out.  Singapore itself is incredible and I think the fantasy of staying in this hotel is probably better than the reality.  ",3,
"Just one of those places you need to tick off the Bucket List. The anticipation was huge but the experience did not quiet make it. Impressive yes, 5 Star, no. It may be that the renovations in the ground floor Lobby area was a distraction but the inside does not have the wow factor of the outside. The Infinity Pool on the roof and 5he views are outstanding and a real thrill, rooms are adequate but not excessive, but the cost is very high. Visit, stay one night, tick off the Bucket List have the experience but move on.",4,
"Stayed 2 nights as a stopover and really loved it. It's very expensive but it is unique. A Singapore icon, there's nothing like it. Of course the summum is the awesome pool with breathtaking views of the city.  Very close to the Gardens which are very good. The 2 domes are well worth the entrance fee, another very special experience. The only drawback is that all the shops close by this hotel are quite expensive, the only food court in the mall underground is overcrowded and still on the pricey side. Highly recommend to check this hotel out once in your life! ",5,
Three towers with huge infinity pool spanning the roof of the three towered along with a restaurant and bar. Owned by same company as Venetian Las Vegas and Macau. I’ve stay at both those and this property compares favorably.    You need your passport to visit the casino and table limits are at least S$25 weekdays but worth a stop if that is your thing.  Lots of shopping much like the Venetian in LV and Macau.  Service is very good but not an inexpensive property.,5,
"The price of the hotel is incredibly high, disproportionate to the level of services and facilities offered.   As queues to check in were huge. this consumed a lot of time in waiting to be served.  Checking out on the TV was very good, convenient and fast.  The pool was terribly crowded, traumatic experience. even there was no place to sit.  And, despite the very high price, breakfast is not included.",4,
"We had a great experience ! We arrived at 3AM. The front desk doesn’t open till 6AM, which we knew. So, we walked around the mall and the casino.  Very quiet this time of day. Anyway, at 6am we got in line to check in. We were greeted by a very nice young man. We explained that we had been waiting to check in since 3 am and just had some small talk. We wanted to see if we could check in knowing our room wouldn’t be ready and leave our bags. We were also 9 hours early for check in (3pm).  My husband had made plans for breakfast with the orangutans at the zoo, to keep us busy.(also special) He asked us if this was our first time at the hotel, which was yes. He said that he would get us a room right then and we could relax before our breakfast. Since, we had been traveling for…",5,
"We stayed for 5 nights at the Marina Bay Sands and loved the hotel. Standouts for us were the infinity pool and the exceptional service at club 55. All the staff at club 55 made us feel as if we were at a home away from home, they were amazing and made our stay special. The rooms are spacious and incredibly comfortable. We loved the towel animals made by our cleaner in room 3654. Great view and great location to heart of Singapore. ",5,
What can anyone say about this hotel? It's amazing. The rooms are beautiful and elegant. the pool on the roof is gorgeous. the price is astronomical. If you have the cash to burn i recommend staying here at least a night or two. Oh and be wary of the drinks on the pool deck. they're also expensive.,5,
"Other than the pool there is no need to stay here. Service was horrible, it took 1 hour to check in. Even though we had pre booked and paid they did not have a room for us. The pool view is one in a million but there is 2000 others up there with you on a tiny 2 meter wide deck!!  Glad we saw it and can tick it off but there is FAR better places to stay in Singapore, choices are endless!",2,
"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon. We got a Gardens by the Bay view on the 33rd floor with a king bed. Rooms were so luxurious and we were treated to cute little towel animals each night. The hotel itself is extremely busy and the wait for lifts, at times, can take a while. The Pool and Restaurants on Level 57 are phenomenal! We spent most of our time up here. The pool itself is only open for guests staying the hotel which is nice and it was never too busy we couldn't get a chair. Hotel is located within easy walking distance tot Gardens by the Bay and we could see the nightly light show from our room. We definitely recommend it for anyone seeking a different, luxurious experience.",5,
"We stayed here for just 1 night in April and it was well worth the hotel move, we wish we had just paid the extra money and stayed here for our entire stay in Singapore.  We arrived at the hotel at 9am to check in, we assumed we would not get our room this early, but we did. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We were on the 42nd floor so the views from our room were lovely. The room had a small balcony, the view looked over Gardens by the bay so it was nice at night to see it all lit up. The bathroom was huge and the shower was great! The bed was massive also and there was plenty of space in the room for luggage etc.  We mainly stayed at this hotel to be able to use the sky park and it was well worth it! You head up to the 57th floor in your robes and the…",5,
"We have to check the weather before going to Skypark as we lost full day due to bad weather, Make sure you carry umbrella or cap, It will be very hot sometimes. View is very good and can see the full Singapore city. But you willn't have access to pool as this would be only for people staying in the Hotel.",5,
"As you start approaching Marina bay sands you already start to feel the excitement, you stare in awe of the building in front of you and cant stop smiling. When you walk in you feel like a king.. When you walk out to the rooftop bar/restaurant you feel on top of the world and nothing else matters for this moment in time.  Some might say it is a little pricey but thats nothing compared to the feeling of aliveness you get by just being there. Definitely will be returning",5,
I’ve been to a lot of beautiful hotels in Asia but this one stood out. Situated on the bay in the heart of Singapore you can’t have a better location.  The rooms are very nice and the mall attached to the hotel is world class for high end shopping.  The infinity pool upstairs however is what makes the hotel.  It overlooks the entire city at night and is simply stunning.  Grab a cold beer in the pool and enjoy the lights of the city with music.  You won’t be disappointed.,5,
"Try to visit once a year SINGAPORE and always staying at Marina Bay Sands which is always a wonderful experience.  Except the comfortable rooms and the famous infinity pool, the hotel offers a variety of options in dining.  We love the food at ""Rise restaurant"" and at “Renku Lounge”. But we can not resist at the “Bread and Butter Putting"" which is the signature dessert of the restaurant and is highly recommended.  ""Sky 57"" offers unique cocktails and a fantastic view , day or night , either to Marina Bay Gardens or the city center.  The Marina Bay Sands is one of the highlights of Singapore.",5,
"We travelled to Singapore from Perth to stay a couple of nights in Singapore.  Upon arrival, the lobby is very modern and the service is outstanding.  We stayed in a family room with 2 single beds and a king bed.  Although the layout of the beds was very one directional, I understand that it is hard to put 3 beds in one room.  The room was large, had a nice colour palette and was extremely clean.  Although our room was only on the 2nd floor, the view was good from the terrace.  When we went up to the infinity pool, it lived up to everyone's expectations.  The pool area was modern and surprisingly not that wet.  The hotel is connected to a train station and Gardens By the Bay.  I think Marina Bay Sands was definitely the right place to stay!",5,
What a hotel.  Spent 5 days here for a business conference and it is extraordinary.    Bear in mind that Singapore is extremely expensive but once I’m get over the cost there isn’t much you can say against Marina Bay Sands.  The only negative I can think of is its sheer size which can make the shared areas like the pool and restaurant quite busy.  I stayed in one of the standard rooms facing the Gardens which was a good size and had a balcony. The service was second to none but the highlight without a doubt is the pool and bars on leave 57.  Literally out of this world.  ,5,
"Hi ! Recently we stayed in MBS. While making a booking on the website, they do not specify the age to qualify as a child. We just returned from Phuket, where the age of child is upto 16 years.So I booked a twin room for 2 adult and 2 children. After checking in the room, I found the beds to be too small for two children, forget about the couple. So I requested a change of room to a double bed with extra bed. I was charged 100S$ + taxes for the additional bed which was ok for us. However, the girl at the reception was not too happy making all these changes. I have never seen her smile in the whole interaction. You dont expect this in a Hotel of this category. Then she told me to move my luggage directly from my old room to my new room. This was also fine with us as we travel…",2,
"We arrived late so check in was a breeze, our room was in tower 3 on level 35.  Given it was evening on entering our room the curtains automatically opened to show us a splendid view of garden on the bays we even had a balcony.  We were part of a conference so Our room rate was very reasonable as there was so many of us staying in this hotel.  The  king size bed was very comfortable lots of pillows and the bathroom had fabulous amenities there was plenty of room for our clothes with lots of drawers closet space however was a  bit cramped during our week long stay.  Room service was amazing you could book a time for it to be delivered and without fail it was delivered precisely at that time the service was outstanding we could not fault it.  We did venture up to the pool and as…",4,
"Stayed for two nights over the Easter weekend.  Arriving by Taxi at the tower 1 lobby was a little chaotic with a queue of cars and guests trying to come and go.  I was also taken aback by how busy the lobby and reception were.  We waited around 15 minutes to be served.  The check in agent was friendly and professional.  We had apparently booked a twin room rather than a king and the agent made it quite clear there were two beds in the room.  At the time, we didn't pay all that much attention being a little weary from travelling, and being a same sex couple, this kind of awkward bed discussion is frequent.  We get to the room and discover what she was saying.. two SINGLE beds.  Like you slept in when you were a kid.  I don't understand why this is even a room configuration…",3,
" We stayed at the hotel 2 families for seven nights. The price was high compared to other hotels in Singapore, but to be in Singapore for me was to stay at Marina Bay Sands.  The check-in experience was poor, took over an hour and a half, and that's after a 15 -hour flight!  Although I had invited my children a large room suitable for a couple plus two children, I was told that an extra bed costs $ 120 a night.  The rooms are spacious and include everything needed for an enjoyable stay. The performances around the Marina and the Super Tree Grove were amazing, the pool luxurious and not overloaded, and the service at the hotel is excellent.",4,
"CONS: -Room is way outdated not worth the money, worn furniture, room feels dirty. -Swimming pool ambiance is like Coney Island NY or imagine a crowded bathhouse-people wearing full clothing to swim.    -Definitely over rated -Save your money - you can access pool with a fee.  PROS: -View is amazing",3,
"I had 1 night at marina bay sands hotel in April 2018 after my 14 night cruise from Sydney before flying home to Scotland.  I had done so much research on this hotel and new exactly what to expect but I was still blown away by the hotel as it was stunning in every way from the building style, the infinity pool, the lobby area where Rise and reception are. The rooms were stunning and the one I had was huge and was a premier twin room and also had a balcony which was great.  The staff at the hotel could not be anymore helpful as if you need the slightest little thing yes no problem is the response and they do it straight away. I myself have worked in hospitality for over 23 years and I know how hard staff work and the staff at the hotel are a credit to your hotel especially the…",5,
"Beautiful, huge hotel with fabulous service, glorious shopping, and even better food. Service is tops. Centrally located, be sure to check out the fountains, art, and gardens inside.  We love this hotel!",5,
"For the price, I expected better in-room facilities. However, the room given to us has the following defects - the hot shower was not working properly, the TV remote was likewise not working properly, a defective rest room door handle.   PROS: Huge bedroom with magnificent view              Includes free access to the infinity pool and observatory             Near to several tourist attractions like the Garden by the Bay, Light Show, Malls, etc.             Includes discount vouchers to shops  CONS: A little outdated interior             Pricey",3,
This was my first time to Singapore and a treat for myself as a solo traveler turning 30 years old.  I landed early (8.30am) and when I got to the hotel they were able to check me into my room early (usually 3pm) so I could make the most of my 3 days in Singapore.  The staff member who greeted me was polite and attentive.  Checking in took 10 minutes max.  The room was on 37th floor with a City view.  The room was spotless and the bathroom was wonderful.  The view from the roof top was fantastic and the serves around the pool were very friendly.  The staff through MBS were very polite and I called room service a few times and was promptly seen to.  The bed was lovely and large and I couldn't hear anyone in the room next to me.  There is a daily light show which you can see from…,5,
We only stayed 2 nights in a club room and we wish we could have stayed a week.  The room was immaculately appointed and it was big.  The staff is so friendly and even though we got to the hotel very early for check-in we were given an available club room.  We were even asked to go up to the club lounge for a coffee or breakfast.  I cant wait to come back.,5,
We can not thank them enough for making our stay very special. Thank you Jaswan and his colleague who checked us in.  Me and my friends had a great time again. We look forward to visiting the hotel soon. Pool staff need a bit of training especially those who look like they are in charge.,5,
We had dinner at the top of  Marina bay sands  The food is really good  Every course perfect and  Nice wine  The view from the top is stunning  Great bar for cocktails pre dinner  So a little pricey but worth it ,5,
"Check in was very busy but well managed and we were seen quickly and checked in by a friendly and professional staff member. The family rooms were all sold out, and as we were only staying one night, we opted to all stay in one room (2 x 9 year old kids, mum & dad). They don't offer any interconnecting rooms. We booked a superior room with 2 beds in it. The room was tasteful and the bathroom lovely and spacious. The beds are too small to comfortably sleep 2 adults in unless you are small and very thin! We ended up having to order a rollaway (additional $100 SGD per night) so that my husband could have his own bed and a proper sleep ahead of our long flight home the following day. We had a housekeeping issue but when we made the management aware of it, they dealt with it…",4,
"Just got back home from a trip that included a 6 day stay in a suite in the MBS. The hotel is clearly meant to be described in superlatives only: the size, the construction, the infinity pool...  The staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. One morning, for a while, only one staff member (Ellaine) seemed to be present in the club lounge and she managed to bring ordered food, clean tables and take orders for more food, all by herself. My last day, the club lounge staff efficiently booked me a table in restaurant Lavo (top of tower 1) so that my guests and I could enjoy a wonderful meal while having a splendid view over the city and the sea.  There is just one complaint that I have. Every evening there are free drinks and snacks available in the club lounge. When I…",3,
"The hotel was nice, the staff couldn't do enough for us. The cleaning staff left welcome notes and towel art for us, but the greatest thing about this hotel is the infinity pool on the top floor overlooking part of Singapore.",5,
"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands on 31st of May in room 3066 of Tower 2. The hotel was overall very comfortable. I had 3 issues staying here: 1. the shoppes shopping mall has a pathetic food court serving local food only. you cannot find any outlet such as mcdonald's, burger king, pizza hut etc. 2. the guy who checked me in on reception, an asian guy with glasses, probably his name was 'Darren' was very rude in conversation. He didn't greet me well. When asking for a late checkout, he gave me 1 hour extra and kind off threatened that if I stayed a minute longer; I will be charged half a day extra. Although on the check out, the girl on the butler service gave me extra time with ease. 3. The rooms get really cold at night, even with the air-con turned off.",3,
"Was there with family during April 1st week of 2018. It was really quite awe-inspiring place.  the whole hotel, staff facility were totally welcoming and made our short trip thoroughly enjoyable. Icing on the cake was of course the Infinity pool and we just could not have enough of it. My Younger son preferred to be there whole day If allowed.  The room on 42nd floor had great view...we could see Gardens by the bay below us. the hospitality was ever smiling .  We would look forward to staying there again.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is hands down my best hotel experience to date. My sister and I stayed for 2 nights on a stop over to London and we didn’t want to leave.   We were quite late when we arrived due to a flight delay but to our advantage, there were no check in cues. We were upgraded to a bigger room with a lounge area which over looked the bay. It was our good fortune that we had were able to see the light show from our room! The hotel was buzzing with excitement given the recent preview of the new Avengers movie.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfasts on both mornings. Despite how busy it was we only had to wait approximately 10 minutes before we were seated. There was a large range of food and they happily accommodated our gluten free diets.  The pool far exceeded my expectations. We…",5,
"I’ve stayed in some great hotels and this is my first time in MBS after my friends have highly recommended this place. Gosh this place has got everything going great from the location, restaurants, shopping, resorts facilities, casino and great accommodation that caters for non-smokers and smokers. The infinity pool is amazing and the gym too which overlooks the bay.  Spend a bit more money and book this place! You won’t regret it.",5,
"After our cruise my husband booked 4 nights at Marina Bay Sands as a treat for us.  When you first enter the hotel it is a bit overwhelming as it’s a very busy - we waited in line at reception only to find out that we could of gone directly to the “club reception”. since we booked a club suite.  Our room was not ready however they did give us our key so we can go upstairs to check out the pool and told us that they will arrange for our bags to be delivered to our room when it was ready.  Taking the elevator to the 57th floor to see the pool was a WOW factor - it was unbelievable - I’ve seen many insta gram photos but to see it in person was wonderful.  We had a light lunch at the restaurant food prices not bad but alcohol - ouch, cocktails were 26.00 dollars each but as my…",5,
"For a leviathan of a hotel I have to say I was impressed by the service (with the exception of the check-in queue). Staff were uniformly polite and efficient and the concierge was extremely helpful, offering great suggestions for dining and other activities that would suit my teenager.  The room was lovely and the view over the Gardens by the Bay impressive. We enjoyed the spacious design/layout of the room and the bathroom was also well designed.  The good lighting was also welcome.",4,
We stayed here for one night at the end of our trip. I have never stayed somewhere so nice in my life!! also worth it just for the pool!! We told the it was my birthday before we checked in and they left a little cake and candles in the room. Just totally amazing.,5,
Room is clean and spacious with nice comfortable bed. You can have a good city view from the sky pool over looking the city central district. Food and beverage  is cost higher than many regular restaurant.  General expectation of a 5 stars hotel. Nothing really spectacular to shout about.,4,
"Recommended Orchid Suite for family with kid and elderly, when you step in the hotel room you don’t feel like going out, spaces, comfortable bed and most importantly their staff well trained with good customer service. ",5,
"I booked this iconic hotel to get access to the famous swimming pool. As a non hotel guest you can't pay for pool day access.  It has a splendid view from rooms and pool. Nice clean and comfortable rooms. Good pool service (pool not busy in day time midweek)  The hotel is like a mini town, you have so many excellent restaurants and even a mall inside it.   The only negative point would be that it's a bit too pricy room rate, especially since the breakfast isn't included.  ",4,
"The hotel is quite a luxury one, but the best thing is the infinity pool.  A visit in Singapore should include at least one night in the Marina Bay Sends since the experience is amazing.  The hotel is near by the Gardens by the bay and there is the shopping mall but is highly expensive one.  We got the 44th floor with an amazing view to the gardens and could even see the show from the room. There are some great restaurants like ""club 55"" and ""spago"" which are very delight.  But the real gem is the infinity pool with its amazing view.  A must site more than just a hotel.",5,
"We decided to treat ourselves and stay one night at the end of our very enjoyable two weeks in Singapore.  The hotel didn’t disappoint. From the minute we arrived service was fantastic. We walked into tower one with our cases and had a few seconds of looking bewildered as to where to check in (such a huge foyer!) when a customer service agent came up to us offering assistance and took us personally to vip check in as other check in was busy (didn’t look too busy but I not complaining!) check in was v efficient and the staff warm and friendly.  Luckily for us our family room was ready at 12:00 so we got an early check in!  We took full advantage and headed straight to the 57th floor pool. Wow. Definitely an amazing experience. It wasn’t too crowed, it was a lovely temperature…",5,
"I decided to book Marina Bay Sands because it seems very convenient as there is a shopping mall nearby.   Arrived at the Tower 1 to checked in and it was the longest queue for 5 star hotel I have experienced ever, too crowded more than I could imagine.  At least while waiting to check in, the hotel offered water and ice cream to guests, and the Japanese female receptionist was very pleasant.   The standard room has a very nice view, good WiFi connection, housekeeping was doing a good job and room service staff were pleasant more than I expected after realizing this is a super crowded hotel.   But room service food wasn’t good and tasted not fresh at all. Visited 57th floor, the swimming pool looked like a water park more than hotel swimming pool. Ordered drink and snacks at the…",3,
"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 2 night last May near the end of a month long SEA trip. The hotel itself and the rooms are stunning. We visited the casino which was a great evening, The best part of our stay of course was the pool. We were very lucky to get a clear day on one of the days. We never tried any of the hotel food which was a shame. Hope to return in the future.",5,
So glad we got a suite for a family holiday. Separate bedroom and double bed in lounge area made it ideal. The iconic pool area doesn’t disappoint although it’s a shame you don’t get continued access for the rest of the day after you check out. Loved the executive club level lounge dining experience,4,
Just spent 4 days in Singapore which was way too short given the excellent service and impressive standard of the marina bay sands hotel.   The hotel is not only impressive but the staff feel like they want to serve.    A rare and unique quality in today’s transient world.    The club rooms and facilities are excellent and the rooms on the 38 floor are just brilliant particularly if you have a city view.    I honestly would stay for a much longer and always at this hotel if this was the standard treatment.  This hotel is just brilliant and given its vast scale is excellently run.    Located in the Bay Area of Singapore it has everything.    Brilliant job! Outstanding!   ,5,
"This place is awesome, but honestly prices are way overrated. Paid around 600 Singaporean dollars for a night, the rooms were just okay. A lot of 5 stars hotels have way better room. But, The service of this place is awesome and stuff is well-trained.  The hook in washroom was not fixed, and trouser just fell off when I hanged. Small details must be checked beforehand by the hotel staff.  Infinity pool is definitely worth the visit and this is where this place stands out from rest. Wonderful experience.",4,
"The Marina Bay lives up to the hype. It is an amazing place to stay and play but it is not for the fiscally challenged.  Swimming on the roof top is fun with kids and for adults, with a Singapore Sling in hand.   The restaurants are both high quality and priced. The rooms are spacious and amazingly quiet. It is hard to fault. The gym facilities and other resort style amenities are as good as anything anywhere in the world.  The complex surrounding the resort seals the deal. Amazing shopping, celebrity restaurants, beautiful boardwalks and a casino.  To top it off it is a cheap commute to the theme parks and airport.  We will definitely come back. You’ll have to try hard to fault.",5,
"This hotel was the one I was most excited about! If you've been following me on my blog, you would know that we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and JW Marriott for one night each the previous days we were in Singapore. But for such an iconic hotel such as the MBS, we decided that we would stay two nights to really get the experience of the hotel and it’s surroundings. To be honest, two nights was not definitely not enough.  LOCATION  The hotel is located in the center of the bay which faces directly towards the Downtown Core of Singapore. This makes for some very impressive city views during morning and dusk. Directly in front of the hotel are The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands if you are in the mood for some luxury shopping. Right in front of The Shoppes is where the nightly…",5,
"We stay here for 3 nights and very satisfied for our stay in this luxury hotel. Our room at the 23th floor ocean view is spacious. The breakfast buffet included in the hotel price are excellent, a lot of delicious choice. Good rating for the pool at the top of the hotel (57th floor) with beautiful view to the city.The just opened  Italian restaurant , price quality to expensive. Once in the life time you must stay here when it is possible.",5,
Pros: This hotel has a great view of Singapore and a very large casino. Conveniently located next to the park and gardens. Nice variety of restaurants. There is a subway stop close by  Cons: Can be big to navigate and check-in is long. Pool is very busy.,4,
"We throughly enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands.  Of corse it's not the cheapest hotel in Singapore but who goes to Singapore to be cheap anyway?.  The pool was awesome, the room was awesome and the food in the restaurant was awesome.",5,
"We stayed for 1 night in a Premium TWIN, facing the gardens, around 27 floor. We had an early check in, which was appreciated. The hotel is enormous, busy and stunning. The pool is incredible, very busy, quite cold - especially in the morning. Overall it's very expensive - we paid around $500SGD room only. A beer by the pool is +$16 SGD for a small beer. Overall it's a one off, incredible experience for 1 night only. For me, 1 night is enough but worth it for the experience, view & pool alone. I would not go back to stay, however am pleased I did it once. My advice, stay 1 night and then go somewhere equally as nice, with a warmer pool, less crowded and save $200 SGD per night.",4,
"I would give this hotel a very good rating for the pool and a good without the pool factor in. Honestly nothing to rave about the rooms. It’s clean and simple. Marina Bay Sands hotel and retail side is expensive ( shops, room service, food court, restaurants). We spend most of our time at the pool from morning to night. Simply enjoyable and the kids love it! ",4,
"Rooms are very regular, check in is very busy all the time, pool is so crowded that you can not take a picture without other 27 people show up in there. A lot of construction in the garden in front that don’t let you relax on bedroom on the day.  ",3,
"I'm not sure if they're trying to market themselves as ""luxury"" but it didn't really feel like it. Although the hotel has a very expensive feel, amenities and incredible views (yes the pool view is really that insane), it felt a bit like a farm house. It's a massive hotel with thousands of rooms and it just felt like the guests were like cattle to them, you don't get a lot of individual attention or a lot of wiggle room for requests.    We went to one of the buffet breakfasts in the morning and specifically asked if it was included as part of our stay, we were told yes and then we were served with a very expensive bill for it. Not a biggie since it was a really good breakfast, but come on.  Like most people, we stayed here for the famous rooftop pool. The view is really…",3,
Marina Bay sands is an epitome of luxury.It is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in Singapore.Mr.Sheldon Adelson the man behind the creation of this ultra luxurious hotel is well known for building luxury hotels around the world.Each and every part of the hotel gives u a feel of something larger than life. The pool on the 57th floor has one of the best views of Singapore. All in all I would say this hotel is a must stay for people visiting Singapore. ,5,
No need to say...this is one of the best hotel in Singapore. Everything just perfect. No complain at all.  The room very spacious. The bathroom also very spacious. Very clean and all functioning very well.,5,
"We had a suite which has its own dedicated check in lounge, all the staff are very polite and helpful, with a great choice of places to eat. All the food was very good and the Adrift and club 55 have my vote. With both the shops, gardens and other amenities close by you could spend 5 days just here, as Orchard Road is just the same. The pool on 57 floor is of course a great feature offering some amazing views of the city and bay.",5,
"Brilliant time spent at Marina Bay Sands. Rooms are fantastic, the views amazing. Great location with brilliant amenities both in and around the hotel.  Infinity pool has a view to die for, but was very busy and crowded - Very popular!  We had a package which included a 2 hour canapés and bottomless drink session - Fantastic service and definitely got your money’s worth.  Overall, great stay - no complaint",5,
"I went there with a friend that lives in Singapore. We decided to do a sightseeing tour up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. It cost to go up the elevator, however, you were able to get a drink or two from the tickets you purchased. The view was amazing, the service was so-so. Come for the view and get OK service in the bar. ",4,
"stayed here on our last night on our way home from Australia.  I like to experience ""must see"" hotels so thought this was the only place to stay.   We arrived fairly early in the morning.. about 7.30-8am. They allowed us to check in early and our room was already ready.   The room was nice and spacious with a lovely view of the marina. We had a club room. we made use of the breakfast, afternoon tea and evening food and cocktails which were brilliant. One of the best lounges I've visited. Almost comparable to Dubai. the staff were helpful and attentive.  lastly the swimming pool. high security presence to get in... quite (understandably) busy up there.. pool has amazing views but full of instagrammers and wanabe models taking selfies. I sensed that some of the guests up on the…",5,
We stayed in Singapore for three nights but could only afford one at this hotel. The whole of Singapore seems to revolve around this iconic building with buses and metro stops really handy. The inside can only be described like the inside of an airport - huge. Our check in process was easy as there was quite a queue so we were ushered into VIP. Check out was also a breeze if you do the automatic. We didn't try any of the restaurants as they were quite pricey but we did eat at the pool on the roof which was quite reasonable. Room was comfy and had everything you'd need. A once in a lifetime experience. We paid extra for a room over floor 40 but I didn't feel that was necessary as you don't spend much time looking out the window!,5,
"Most prominent structure of the Singapore skyline is the 'Marina Bay Sands' hotel. During our various trips to Singapore my girlfriend and I have explored Singapore in different ways, like locals going to offbeat places and have our favorite spots. However, we never had the opportunity to experience Singapore in true style. Hence, to begin our honeymoon we thought that staying at the 'Marina Bay Sands' would be the perfect start. We booked a Orchid Suite for our stay which comes with plenty of complimentary amenities and benefits which was only made better with our honeymoon package. We chose the room overlooking the 'Gardens By the Bay' and it was just perfect view during the day and night (that is if you are looking for a peaceful view). After arriving at the hotel, we were…",4,
"What can I say, this has got to top the best hotel that I’ve stayed at. The famous infinity pool is amazing at night. We had the garden view which was an amazing scene to wake up to in the morning.  Food and staff were also very good. A bit pricey but definitely a must do experience ",5,
"Amazing spot, must go when in Singapore if only to sip on a Bellini and take in the city around you on one side or get a peak into the gardens by the bay on the other. Normally you’d pay to go up to the viewing deck, by spending a tiny bit more you can go to the terrace bar and enjoy a leisurely cocktail. ",4,
"We stayed here for 2 out of 4 days in Singapore. As a design the hotel is amazing and the view from the pool was incredible. Our room was clean and tidy and the staff were lovely. After the initial wow factor of the hotel we felt you don't really get a personal experience (which we felt we had, had at another hotel) we think it's due to the sheer size of the place. We ate at Lavo where the food was amazing but we were a bit disappointed at the service. We booked a table after visiting the pool and felt some snobbery towards us. The lady was polite but made out that she would need to sqeeze us in it as was a bit short notice to book and that there was a dress code for my husband. However when we turned up for our meal the restaurant had loads of empty tables and we saw lots of…",4,
"I was afraid that a huge, must see property like Marina Bay would have long lines and uninspired employees.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  We of course loved the aesthetics and the pool, but we also loved everyone that helped us - from the gentleman at the front desk to the staff at the Club 55 lounge to the bellhop.  There were no longs lines. Everything was just as you would expect at a luxury hotel.  We stayed in a club room - I almost didn't do it since the math isn't very favorable for a family of 4 (we have two kids, 13 and 11) but I'm so glad we did.  We stayed in a HUGE room on the 48th floor and having Club 55 access is soooo worth it.  The views from the restaurant are beautiful, and the offerings and service are incredible!!! It was a great over the top visit at…",5,
Stayed here on our way back from Thailand. Came specially for this Hotel and the Gardens By The Bay. We were not disappointed. The Hotel is huge and I feel a little impersonal. The infinity pool is beautiful. Best time to visit is to go early morning otherwise there is quite a crowd. The Marina Sands is basically next door to the Gardens By The Bay which you must visit. Lots of eating options here and plenty of shopping. Make sure you see the laser/light show after dark..just beautiful and photos do not do it justice.   ,5,
"This is perhaps one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at.  It is impressive in terms of architecture, design, spaciousness of the room, bed comfort, room and hotel amenities, breakfast choices, cleanliness, service and overall wow factor.  As we were waiting in line to check in (which wasn't a long wait by the way), we were offered cold juice drinks which, while not unusual for some hotels, was certainly appreciated.  Upon entering our room on the 35th floor of tower 3, we were impressed by how spacious and well appointed the room was, not to mention how technologically advanced it was (think automatic/electronic curtain controls).  Stepping out into the balcony, we were greeted with stunning views of the Gardens By The Bay and all of Singapore.  What I believe the pièce de…",5,
Very nice and top hotel. Room service was excellent. The views from the infinity pool are beautiful and very relaxing. Room was quite big over looking the super-tree grove. The bathroom was well equipped - good for a relaxing bath or a quick shower.    ,5,
Few days before check-in i read some bad reviews regarding the service etc. and that there is always too much line everywhere so i had assumed before check-in that being a huge hotel with so much crowd i should expect the service to be a little less perfect than other hotels.  BUT i was so wrong.  Everything went smooth.  From luggage collection to we were directly to VIP check-in.  Then there was Xpress Service on the phone which was also a breeze.    The rooms were also big enough and the bathroom was bigger with seperate shower and toilet areas which is useful when you are going as a family and checking out early.  Everything was perfect.  Cons: Garden by the bay facing room. Huge bathroom with seperate area for shower and seperate for toilet with their individual doors.(Some…,5,
"This perfect location offers fantastic views of the city or of Gardens By the Bay.  The rooftop sky park is not to be missed and the infinity edge pool is simply Awesome!!! Beware the sun is intense, so use sunscreen or you'll be bright red in no time.  Please note that the pool area nearest Tower 3 is the family area, there is an adults only area at the other end.  Great attentive staff and all the amenities are first rate.  If you go to Singapore, you simply must stay at the Marina Bay Sands once in your life - it's worth every penny!",5,
"This hotel is very luxurious with its own MRT station. I stayed in a family room for one night. I love the mattresses here because I slept very well here, The room is stylish like other boutique hotels, so I don't feel that my stay is that worth it. They also provide complimentary water which is very needy for an expensive city like Singapore. The highlight is the Infinity Pool with a stunning view of the skyscrapers of Singapore and you can see the Merlion from the pool. It's recommended to swim at the pool and take some pictures for instagram!",4,
"After some initial issues with our booking, which were sorted out by the reservations team, we checked into this wonderful hotel on our arrival at Singapore.   We got a room on the 39th Floor which gave a Complete view of Gardens by the Bay. These rooms have a small Balcony attached too.  Infinity pool is a must visit.  Food was great too. Had good vegetarian options in Indian as well as International cuisine.   There were Indian options in Room service too.",5,
"The hotel itself was fine but the main attraction of the pool was worth it. Fantastic view both sides but mainly everyone is lined up against the infinity pool taking selfies. Pretty busy place as expected but also perfectly located for the main mall, the marina, the light show and the gardens by the bay.",5,
"You HAVE to stay here. Without doubt one of the most stunning, well run and enjoyable hotels in the world. The staff are efficient and courteous, we were allowed early check in and late check out at no extra cost. The room was spotless with a fabulous bathroom and of course incredible views over the bay. The pool, although always crowded, is must do. Its shallow so not great for swimming, but mostly its for relaxing, having a drink and admiring the stunning sunsets. There is a great laser light show (free) over the bay every evening and also one in the Gardens which were an added bonus. Didn't eat here at all so can't comment on food.",5,
"We booked this hotel after seeing it on a BBC programme, we were so excited to go and it really lived upto and exceeded our dreams in many ways.  We stayed in a club room, which is definitely worth doing, it included breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks (champagne included!) with canapés.  The room service was beyond belief, every time we left the room it was reserviced, including our daughters sandal straps being unfastened ready to wear next time!  In fact the service from arrival was super efficient and always polite, our bags were taken from the taxi, labelled, we were given a tag, after you check in the tag is scanned and our bags were in our room 2 minutes after us....the same service was available for storage after check out.  The room was beautiful, completely…",5,
"I traveled to Singapore to celebrate my birthday and stay at the Marina Bay Sands. I was greeted with a room upgrade, and the Butler met me at the checkin counter to take us to the Sands Suite. The dining table in the room was covered in chocolates, fruit platter, wonderful chocolate mousse birthday cake and champagne 🍾.  The Sands Suite comes complete with 24 hour butler service, the ice was replaced twice a day as well as the champagne was kept in fresh ice (until we found the time to consume it).  The infinity pool on the Sky deck was as spectacular as many have said it was.  The Sky deck restaurant LAVO and Ce LA Vi Lounge were both spectacular.   We had an incredible experience and I would like to thank Ian Wilson, COO and Waglin  Sum, his assistant for their very generous…",5,
"As one of the most prominent landmarks in Singapore today, this is definitely an excellent location to stay in. The infinity pool is a must do and a great experience. The rooms are luxurious, but not really exceptional - though the views certainly are (we stayed in a city facing room).  The check in was very efficient, staff extremely courteous and friendly, and the hotel is very conveniently located close to other city landmarks like the Gardens by the Bay. The hotel complex itself has everything from food to shopping areas to entertainment - so one can just spend quality time there, put ones feet up, and relax.  Overall, probably rather expensive for regular stays there, but definitely recommended as a one time experience at least. One can also get fairly attractive deals if…",4,
Marina Bay Sands is simply the best hotel/accomodation we have been to. From the moment we arrived till the end it was just perfect. We could not put any fault on it. They really exceeded our expectations. Make sure to get a room that includes club 55 as well. The food and service is just perfect in club 55. Of course the infinity pool is the best attraction in the hotel and we really really enjoyed it. The staff are so friendly and proactive. The room was so spacious and clean. All the gardens and parks are in a walking distance from the hotel. We are already planing our next trip to Marina Bay sands. ,5,
"We stayed here for a bit on a recent trip and overall it was a very nice stay. We were lucky to get an early check in and the room was lovely and the view of the Gardens by the bay was incredible.  We spent the majority of the time in the infinity pool and the hot tubs at the top and this was the main reason for the stay. The views were unique and even though the pool at the top was very cold, it was well worth the pictures. It wasn't too busy overall.  Room service menu was very expensive but this was expected and it was useful to be connected to the mall for convenience.  In summary- it was a lovely stay and we managed to get the photos we wanted. Would we stay again? Probably not as there is nothing overly special about the room etc but would definitely recommend it to anyone…",4,
"Best stay ever. Traveling is so essential for finding yourself. Travel & Explore. I always knew I love the city. I live in Dubai, but when I came to Singapore 🇸🇬 I fell in love over again 💖find out",5,
We stayed two nights here on our way to London from New Zealand.  Our room was amazing with great views of the park; spacious and clean.  The pool was amazing but it does get crowded and finding a seat can sometimes be a problem.  Nice central location well worth the money - we loved our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to return.,5,
"We got an upgrade room that was huge! Great views of the park across the street. We went up to the pool and much to my surprise it was very, very cold. I'd guess the water temp is 74-76 degrees! Suppose they keep it that way so people don't spend the day in the pool. We were there about 1.5 hours with overcast sky and I got burned to a crisp! Very weird especially for a Florida native, so watch out!  I would definitely recommend doing this once in your life, but at over $600 per night I doubt you want to spend a week here.",5,
"The Marina Bay was the most amazing hotel that I have stayed in. Gigantic, much visited, has several entertainments that we can not enjoy with short days. The infinity pool, the view of the city and the giant trees are its main and unforgettable attractions.",5,
Amazing hotel with the finest of finishes. Booked two rooms and was upgraded to Straits Suite! AMAZING! simply incredible experience with the best views in Singapore. Service excellent and room was mind blowing. Gym room Karaoke room Massage room. Two studies Lounge and two bedrooms. Insane views and massive lunge and dining room. Room 5388 was our room and stunning bay views. It is. with the experience. Infinity pool is sensational. ,5,
The most exclusive and high-end shopping center in Singapore. Wear something proper if you dont want to look different from the rest. You can find all the high-end brands in MBS. Good place for social media content too! ,4,
"Check in process was super quick and efficient, asked for a room overlooking the gardens by the bay and the gentleman was excellent. Room was awesome, and views unreal. Obviously being such a massive draw card to Singapore now, Level 57 is crazy insane with guests, but funnily its still enjoyable. Check out super fast and easy, I found the staff to be awesome and really just loved the short stay here, definitely the go to when I'm back.",4,
"I loved this hotel. Yes it’s huge but it’s a must stay if you are ever in Singapore. We were lucky enough to have early check in, so the pool was quite quiet when we went up there. The views are spectacular and even better at night! It was my boyfriends birthday and I emailed the hotel before hand to let them know, they brought a birthday cake to our room which was a nice little touch.",5,
"For over a $1000 SGD paid per night we were expected “wow”, and the hotel falls WELL SHORT in so many ways!  - check-in process disastrous...what is the point of providing the option to provide details before hand online as it does not avoid the long queues! It didn’t save anytime.   - no check out beyond 11 am, and considering you can’t check in until 3 pm, that’s $1000 for less than 24hrs! A holiday Inn even has later check out!  - paid for a club room at over $1000 per night, and is so not worth the price - not sure what you get for this. Paid half this price for jnr suite at ParkRoyal on Pickering and you get soooo much more for your money - better room, service and Infiniti pool nicer (although with a lesser view)  - access to Club 55 is a joke. Afternoon tea is as…",1,
"Checking-in experience was bad like others have mentioned, we spotted the infamous long Q the moment we got off the taxi. would be great if they could have kids playground to keep kids busy while waiting. it was like a marketplace in the lobby. we had a city view room and the rooms were average. Going up to the pool was another poor experience, on the first instance my son and daughter were stopped by the attendants, interrogating them on room no, even though they were holding kiddies cards, it was so traumatizing that for breakfast, my husband had to spend time to persuade them eat because they were so afraid of the gate/attendants. Breakfast was average for the price paid $22++ for 1 kid I think, but I guess it was the brand that you pay for. pool view was something new but,…",1,
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for three nights we only stayed 2 !!  We had a great room with Balcony no complaints here...   Checking in Long nightmare ... I booked directly with the hotel rate was different from Email obviously in the hotels favour ....   We had booked a club room... oh my Lordy what a nightmare when we Arrived at level 55 club Lounge there was a queue out of the door our first visit not a great reception... final after a long queue we arrived at the reception desk of club to be told Sorry No Tables More Queueing Really a hotel that is charging £500 plus a night ... in short Some  great staff that are trying their best by increasing tide .....  Not worth the Money 💰 obviously living off their Name and location seriously I would go elsewhere for better…,3,
"We stayed for 2 nights in this huge hotel. It is a major tourist destination and you have to get over the fact that you don't get any special treatment because you are staying there, (although only hotel guests can access the pool area). Checking in we had to wait in a fairly long queue, so it wasn't the best first impression. Having said that the rooms are very spacious and well decorated, the bathrooms very well appointed, they were serviced very well twice a day. The restaurants we tried were excellent. The view from the pool area is of course amazing and the experience on the whole was very good.",4,
"From the moment I entered this huge hotel I know I'm into something special. Part of the defining skyline in Singapore this one from the exterior is an architectural and engineering marvel. Housing more than 2000 rooms I expect the worse. Check in time a hassle at first. But the friendliness and sincerity of the front desk personnel somehow ease the expected wait. The deluxe garden view room ( I booked 2 , connecting) was pretty fine with me. Very functional . Amenities well provided, from the bathroom stuff to the mini bar items. Very comfortable beds. Wide flat screen smart Tv with many international channels. AC temp took some time to cool though. Accessible from the hotel are the many shops and restaurants . They provide access to the Shoppes , and popular attractions the…",5,
"The pictures make it look nice, but the roof-top pool is packed and noisy, as is the rest of the hotel. The food is ok, but nothing special and queueing up for a table is normal. The location is good.",3,
Loved our stay here! The check in process was outstanding - seamless from bellmen to front desk. Room was lovely. Very comfortable and peaceful space. Great security. The rooftop pool is amazing . Make sure to watch the sun go down and the skyline light up from the pool area. We had an early flight so arranged for our luggage to be picked up from the room early that morning. He was at our door right on time had our luggage in the taxi waiting when we came out. Super service everywhere we went.,5,
"a wonderful trip with me family. nice hotel and great view. i like the swimming pool much. hope we ll come back again. from the pool i can see almost place in sigapore . feel i can fly, swim in the sky",5,
"I’ve stayed at Marina Bay Sands twice and enjoyed my stay. Lobby gets very crowded and room is not that special (but still very clean, pretty big and nothing to fault!) but Infinity pool makes it all worth the stay!! Absolutely beautiful pool which is one of the best I’ve seen. It does get very crowded with people taking pictures but I didn’t mind too much as it was hard to not take any pictures of this pool myself. I’ve stayed in some of the best hotels in Singapore before but Marina Bay definitely stands out for me due to its pool alone.",5,
"awesome food, very Near casino, direct bridge to go garden by the bay and its night show was awesome, i spend one day at rooftop and it was amazing swimming pool and sea view and city view gave me incredible experience which i never had...",5,
"We decided to spoil ourselves and book 3 nights at the Marina Bay sands. The building itself I just a sight to behold, and we were very excited about the upcoming experience.  First impression: the queue for check-in was quite extensive. I had read a review about this and was therefore prepared for the wait. One of the staff members saw to us very quickly and escorted us to another area for check-in where we were assisted by a very friendly and professional staff member. We had checked in early and our room was not ready yet, however we were given temporary access cards and were invited to relax at the pool while waiting. An email would be sent as soon as our rooms were ready and our luggage was stored.  Up to floor 57 we went, and wow! The infinity pool looked so inviting, and…",5,
"We stayed here for 4 night, felt a bit disappointed, the hotel is very crowded  and noizie, the pool is breath taking but also very crowded all day long with people taking selfies... Very nice cafe shop at the entrance to tower 3. It's important to ask for room at 35 floor and up, so you won't wait for the elevaitor twice. Very comfortable aces to MRT.  I think the hotel is great for one night stay.",3,
"From Skyline city view of Singapore to world's largest rooftop infinity pool; Marina Bay Sands stands proud of it's luxurious experience.   Although, the hotel is fully staffed at the register desk, the lines are extremely long. Waited an hour just to check-in. The rooftop infinity pool has an amazing view, but it was extremely packed with other tourist. Variety of things to do and eat in the Hotel.  Dinner at Rise Dinner Buffet: was super busy. Waiter rush us to finish so she can seat others. Food was mediocre.   Overall, the city skyline view from the hotel room was magnificent, but the hefty price for two months prior hotel reservation to super touristy and busy hotel staffs, put the experience at average. ",3,
"We were staying in Singapore for a week and went to this shopping centre almost every day (we stayed at a different hotel).  They have designer labels I've never seen in Australia.  Some of the most amazing clothes, accessories, toiletries, food items ever.  Catering for a wide age range, lots of places to eat, a theatre with live shows, amusement park just nearby.",5,
"Stayed here one night with my husband purely for the infinity pool experience, which was fabulous. The late afternoon evening views are beautiful. The pool is sectioned into 3, 1 being adults only. Very clean, excellent poolside service. The hotel rooms (35th floor city view) was very spacious and service is good as to what one would expect of hotel of this calibre.  Disappointed with the rest of the hotel ambience, the lobby could be easily be mistaken for a train station concourse and the casino had no charisma  Definitely recommend a stay for the pool but no more than one night. Plenty of other beautiful hotels in Singapore to choose from",4,
"This was my first stay at the Baysands and to be honest I was quite blown away by it. I’ve never really stayed anywhere with this level of luxury before so it is a little hard to compare it to others of its standing.  The pool is obviously the highlight of the stay, and because of this it was naturally quite crowded. But amazing all the same.  Only thing I can say for improvement, is that for over £300 a night my other half would have expected a better hairdryer. But that’s being ultra picky.  Everyone knows the reputation of this place, and is 100% worth the trip (and money).",5,
"we stayed at this hotel and had reserved a grand king room the room was beautiful very big had everything, super clean smelled good had view on the bay and the gardens it was perfect, the club 55 breakfast that came with the room was alos perfect, the thing i did not like is the adult section of the pool is really small and unless you get there very early you will end up in the regular section where they let the kids run, dive, jump in and around the pool, so for sure you cannot be resting there and if you are on the row of lounge chairs near the pool you will get splashed every few minutes if not seconds....this is the main reason i gave 4 stars, also they have the happy hour break from 5 to 7 at club 55 included in our room but we waited almost 30 minutes to get seated and…",4,
"If ever visiting Singapore, for $400-$700 a night you get an opportunity to stay at one of the most unique hotels in the world. Recently featured on a Netflix series called Amazing Hotels, its no surprise this place was featured. I stayed here for 3 nights and had a panoramic view of the Marina and Super Tree. There are so many amenities onsite I can't list them here but it is high end. This hotel is basically 3 - 60 story skyscrapers that all connect at the lobby level. On top of the 3 building on the 57th floor is the worlds largest infinity pool. I posted video and pics on my IG page but ran out of memory so I could not post them here. The view is unmatched by any pool I have ever experienced in my life. It offers a panoramic view of the Singapore skyline and is breathtaking…",5,
"Hotel 'bones' are great, stunning architecture with an unparalleled location and rooftop facility.  It SHOULD be a world leading hotel.  It isn't and all due to service.  1.  Check-in horrendous.  We stood in a queue after a long flight for over 30mins.  Once at the desk the process was so slow.  Our stay was booked weeks in advance but appeared no preparation.  Possibly the slowest I have ever witnessed at any hotel.  It felt like cattle being processed ... and very slowly.  2.  Room developed a leak from the ceiling at 11pm at night.  We had to be moved to a room on a different floor to our young children.  Again, the process painfully slow, was well over an hour to be moved after a 13hr flight.  The room zircon clearly hadn't been maintained.  3.  After requesting to be…",1,
"We stayed in a deluxe room in third floor with access to skydeck and the infinity pool. The staff was very nice and they let us check-in very early without charging extra.   The building itself makes a really huge impression and reminds me of an airport due to it being very crowded. There are lots of restaurants, shops and an escalator that takes you to their mall including casino.  At the infinity pool bathrobes and towels can be borrowed free of charge and the view from the top is just amazing! Caution: pool water is freezing cold!  We had a nice welcome. Tea and Coffee maker, bathrobes, slippers are included in room. The hotel staff was always very helpful and whenever we needed anything the hotel staff never hesitated to help us. We also got help with transporting our…",4,
"The hotel has a great architect with a boat at the top, there is outdoor rooftop swimming pool you should try once. one side all room over looking over the sea, and the other side to city center. I also love the casino at ground floor",5,
"We stayed a night at MBS as my spouse had a dinner to attend. This was my 2nd time staying here and I must say their service improved tremendously over the past years. The security and car park signage on the entrance are still as confusing as ever though.  Check in was awesome. I was queueing to check in with my 4yo and was carrying my infant when a staff took notice and brought us in to the priority area. Took a number and we were seated down instead of having to stand! I was so appreciative of this gesture! When it was our turn, the check in staff was very proactive. She extended our check out time before we even requested for it. And thanks to her, we were able to enjoy the Skypark the next day and my infant was also able to take his morning nap. She truly made this visit a…",5,
"I was amazed to be staying in the Marina Bay Sands! It is exactly what I expected, it is as if you almost did not have to leave the hotel to do anything!  In my experience the price was well worth it but you have to know that it is not a luxury premium private experience... it is very fancy and nice but it is always full and crowded so it’s more trendy that private. But i think it is a most do if you are willing to pay for it while in Singapore",4,
"We want to stay at this hotel because of the infinity pool, and we were amazed by it! We get a suite with an amazing view to the gardens by the bay and also the view from the pool was unbelievable! It is a huge hotel with lots of rooms, but also with lots of things you can do in it. It is so close to gardens by the bay so you can just walk to them. It’s highly recommended. ",5,
"Well this place is just immense, been wanting to go here for quite some time now and honestly it’s just incredible. The food, the drink, the views. It’s not cheap by any means but I promise you it’s worth every penny!  ",5,
"We enjoyed our stay on the 42nd floor with a sky view room here for 3 nights. We wish we had more time in Singapore as we could have easily filled the whole three days just exploring this hotel - it's huge! But we had other things to fit in.   The infinity pool is very busy and it's quite a site seeing everyone taking their selfies, including us. Was a wonderful view. The hotel room was nice but nothing stand out. The staff we dealt with were polite.   Most food places around were very expensive and we couldn't justify the cost but worth a visit here.",5,
"Fantastic - room, view, fixtures, fittings, staff, food, etc.  Poor - bed. Was hard and uncomfortable, might as well have put a sheet on the floor the mattress was so firm. As a side sleeper I struggled to get comfortable an had the worst night sleep in the 3 weeks we’ve been traveling  Glad we’re only here for 1 night as I couldn’t put up with that bed twice  Only reason I’d ever consider coming back is because of the rooftop pool. That almost made the brick mattress bearable ",2,
"Stayed her for four nights. Booked a room for three adults. Room small, brought a sofa bed, had to move furniture to put it in. So a bit cramped. One shower gel left for three people, yes could have rang and got more, but shouldn't have too. Check in very impersonal, didn't ask us if we had any preferences. Asked for a late check out, a charge of 400 Singapore dollars, which we declined. Sometimes long waits for lifts.   The pool area as expected was spectacular. Overall we enjoyed our stay. Would I stay again? No far too expensive, been there and done it.  Better value hotels in Singapore.  But the Marina Bay Sands was on the bucket list.",4,
"Had a few drinks at the rooftop bar of Marina Bay Sands.  The view is surely amazing. Only advice is to get there early or spend some time if you want to have a good spot as it is quite busy as you can imagine.  Also, do not miss the lights show and the shopping mall just next to the hotel.",4,
"This is the only place I've ever stayed in Singapore, so hard to compare it to anything else.  It is a one of a kind property though and one that I would recommend trying at least once.  The rooftop infinity pool is worth it.  The pictures don't do it justice.    The room was comfortable, although my understanding is the rooms in tower one are renovated and much nicer.  I was in tower 3.   Food was good, although pricey.  There are so many options in the attached mall, you have many things to choose from.  The gardens are connected to the hotel and easy to access.",5,
"Amazing everything: the rooms are huge, lovely bathroom with bath tub and shower, lots of toiletries, iron and ironing board in every room, rooms with view to the gardens have a big balcony and spectacular view (the higher level the better, of course). The Infinity pool on 57th floor is something you really have to see and try, you can even have breakfast by it's side or anything your heart disires. Totaly worth it!",5,
"That hôtel is really really big and very expensive but there are many clients ! We went there because we wanted to try the extraordinary pool ! That is the only reason to choose that hôtel. It is well located to visit Garden by the bay and do luxury shopping and fine dining but everything is so expensive ! That is not the real Singpore but people come only to have great pictures of the pool. The staff is not very welcoming, and the room is good but I expected something better for the price we paid. The hôtel is mixed with the mall and boutiques so it is not a very comfy place. I advice those who can afford to try the amazing experience of swimming at the 57 floor, but one night is enough, and don't expect a palace service and offer, even if you paid the high price.",4,
"This hotel may seem pricey but it was worth every penny. I had seen it featured on a BBC programme and made a promise that we would stay there even if it was for 1 night. As it turned out, we stayed for 2 nights whilst returning home from New Zealand. On entering the hotel, the foyer is immense and a marvel to look at. It has its own MRT station (Marina Bay Sands and Bayfront). From the airport, it is 9 Singapore dollars per person or around 30 dollars (depending on traffic, we paid less but was quoted this price). Our room was absolutely huge! And we had the best view of the city skyline that meant we could watch the light show from our bedroom window. When you enter your room, the curtains will open presenting the view to you. We had 2 queen size beds, air con, safe, mini…",5,
"Flawless service and an impeccably appointed luxury hotel.  From the moment we checked in (after midnight) and we were offered a club room upgrade, to the complimentary showers before heafing to the airport after exploring Singapore, everything was perfect.  Thank you!",5,
"I’ve spent 3 nights at this wonderful and luxury hotel into a basic room, which was absolutely comfortable and very huge. I had a fantastic view of Gardens by the bay. The service has been excellent. During my staying, I’ve celebrated my birthday and the staff of the hotel offered to me a delicious piece of chocolate cake to find into my room. It has been amazing.  The infinity pool is absolutely breathtaking. You can enjoy the view of Marina Bay and more of S’pore from the top. You would never go out the hotel during your staying.  I definitely will try to come back to Singapore and moreover to stay in this wonderful hotel.",5,
Stayed at MBS for 2 nights with family. As per recommendation we booked the VIP check in/out which turned out to be so useful. Those who do not have the VIP service booked will have to queue up with an average waiting time of 30min. which is understandable considering the large scale of this property.  The hotel is impressive and the location maybe the best if you are looking for Singapore city experience. The MRT station is right downstairs and the hotel is connected to The Shoppers - a high end mall with plenty of restaurants.  Our room was located at the 17th floor with a stunning view over Gardens by the Bay and a large balcony. Cleanliness could have been better... the kettle and drawer with teabags and coffee were super dirty. Safety hazards are not taken seriously which…,3,
"It was a beautiful hotel, great room, stunning pool and food was surprisingly good.  We had itch on our body while lying down on the bed, we told the housekeeper and they came quickly to replaced the sheets. That was good.  We ordered room service for fish and chips, prawn Mac and cheese, chicken burger and ham sandwiches. Food were really good and warm.  The only down side was the check in queue is long as well as check out. The cleaning lady in the sauna room was like a like a mother telling us don’t do this and that, not very professional. Don’t need that in a 5 star hotel.",4,
"The Marina bay sands is an architectural wonder. The rooftop infinity pool alone is worth a stay, but it is expensive. It is also a very busy hotel with 3 towers and all the guests it holds. The lobby was a little bewildering at first. The service was good, the room clean and tastefully decorated. Slippers and a robe where provides to go up for a swim and a poolside lounge. But as I said, it is busy. At certain times it is hard to get a sun lounger (I chose to get up at 6am and see the sun come up with just a few other guests) Drinks are also expensive at 14 SGD for a small beer. I think if I do Singapore again I would get a cheaper hotel opposite the Marina bay sands and enjoy my view of the hotel from across the water. Location is good as it has underground acces and the open…",4,
"Me and my wife had a Anniversary staycation in MBS.A great experience stay in this 5 star hotel from check in to check out.Room is spacious,all amenities fully provided.We chose to stay in a garden view and it looks great in the morning.Pool at 57th floor are special,you can view all the buildings while swimming.",5,
"Fairly typical for a North American owned property which does not represent the Asian service, everything functions although the room design is a bit old. It was a bit like living on a railway station, lots of activity but nothing memorable.",4,
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 4 days with a family of 4 (2 kids). We had booked a garden view room - got the 22nd floor - Amazing view with a surprisingly spacious balcony/terrace. Checking in was easy but took a bit of time as we came at a busy time. Service was great and along the lines of what I should be able to expect from a hotel at this price. Staff was friendly and helpful throughout the whole hotel - from security staff, cleaners to the staff at the pool. Everybody is eager to give tips and insights into what to do in Singapore.  Everything was absolutely clean. The pool is a bit busy (expected) but we always got a spot and the view is really amazing.  The location is fantastic and you can get around Singapore via MRT very easy. We checked the nearby mall (Shoppes)…",5,
"Not a lot of substance. There's no doubt that a lot of effort has gone into this establishment. The only problem is that not a lot of it has gone into the parts that matter. The staff, whilst courteous and polite feel and interact like robots which is rather off putting. The food is barely above average, even for a buffet. All in all, the whole experience felt forced. However it's not all bad. The room was excellent and offered fantastic views of the area. The pool...... well the pool was as you'd expect, breathtaking. Of course it gets busy so pick your time to go. The gym was quite good also. The hotel and amenities were five star, the reason I only rated three was because the experience was so underwhelming. Honestly, not worth the money. Oh and forget loyalty from this hotel…",3,
"We have been here for a few days now, and leave tomorrow evening. I have been thinking about this review for a few days, because while most things are very good to excellent, one very serious misrepresentation has really colored our experience.  We came here after a six week cruise and booked an Orchid Suite as we like a larger hotel room. We considered other nearby hotels, but selected this one based on a family recommendation. First, the very good to excellent;  - the staff, from front desk/concierge, to room attendant, to restaurant staff are incredibly friendly and willing to assist in any way they can. Unlike many hotels where this seems pro-forma, this is genuine. - the suite was well laid out, comfortable and very well taken care of - all of the on-site restaurants, and…",3,
"ck-in a breeze, quick and efficient. Rooms large. Bed really comfortable.  Staff genuinely friendly. Bathroom magnificent with all amenities.

For a hotel of this calibre, really believe the coffee could be better. Nescafe instant sachets and tasteless creamer not cut it. We stayed in tower 2 over Easter weekend so it was cumbersome with long waiting times to catch a lift, transfer to another lift, then a short hop to rooftop. Food and beverages prices higher than the building itself. It's not the most expensive city in the work for nothing ",5,
"The hotel is very well known and must say it is over-rated based in my experience starts by time of check in, quality of breakfast, hygiene of the infinite Pool till check out.  I would love to be again in Singapore but not this hotel",3,
We stayed in a room overlooking Gardens by the Bay which was a nice view with a massive balcony however there was no outdoor seats or a table where you could sit and enjoy your balcony which seemed silly for the size of the balcony. I think 2 nights at this place is more than enough.  Our Shower was dodgy and the little inconveniences like that makes you feel for the price it’s a let down.   The infinity pool was nice however very packed and is freezing cold- maybe it should be heated? The lines to wait for breaky is rediculous so be prepared to wait for ages.  Overall MBS we feel is super overrated and extremely over priced. I would have loved to have spent my $600 per night somewhere else. I will not be back as iv experienced it once and that’s all you really need. ,3,
"Yup.  It’s pricy.   But it’s also a pretty cool experience.  What made it worth the price?   Well, more than anything it was swimming in the rooftop pool.  That was on my bucket list.  The room was nice too but there are lots of hotels with nice rooms.    So the pool is what made it special.   The rooftop restaurant (Spago) was also cool but don’t need to stay there to eat.  The promenade light show also cool but again, don’t need to stay there for that.    So, yup, the pool is amazing.   It has three sections with one reserved for adults.  It’s 55 yards long and if you come before 8 am you can do laps.  The rest of the day it’s open.  Most people who use it hang on to the edge facing the city. So even though there are lots of people, you can actually swim laps during the day…",5,
If you are just quickly doing a stopover or staying here for a few days you need to either day at the Marina Bay or come for a visit.   The pool is amazing and the food here is great.,5,
"We loved our two night stay here for our anniversary. I’d like to thank the staff for the surprise they helped arrange for my wife.  The hotel looks amazing. It’s huge. It’s brilliantly located near many of the top Singapore sights, so it was a great base for the two days to avoid having to travel in from further out.   The infinity pool is a crowning jewel of this place. It wasn’t difficult to get a sun bed. Do wear sun cream as I got burned even though I was under a tree and it was cloudy.   It’s expensive but we found it was worth it for a special occasion. ",5,
"What an amazing building that can be seen while at gardens on the bay, it’s a wonderful back drop behind the metal giant trees, all very surreal. We were not sure if we would be allowed in and never thought we would get to the top. We walked towards the huge hotel and just ended up in a queue where we paid to go to the top floor. It was amazing and ticked another thing off my bucket list. We could even see the infinity pool only guests are allowed to use that is shown in pictures. The view is stunning, there is a shop you can by ice creams etc from and a bar. Well worth a visit and not over priced.",5,
"Get ready to pay a lot for this hotel. The hype around the hotel, casino, and infinity pool allows it to charge a lot. The hotel offers a lot of positives: the fitness center is amazing, includes a great locker room, sauna and steam room. Rooms are big and the bathrooms are well equipped.  The hotel is huge though. Not very personal. Quite a mission to navigate the elevators to go between the three towers. The breakfast is very expensive.  If you want to use the pool, book the hotel for one night and indulge. But I would not stay again for an extended period.",4,
Speechless and jaw dropping is all that I can say about this place when our taxi just pulled up. I have been around the world and this absolutely takes first place if your looking for a 5 star quality hotel.  Pictures do no justice. You just need to add this to your bucket list and get it checked and get that  selfie with hotel in the background. ,5,
"Stayed here for our honeymoon in March. We booked the honeymoon package via the MBS website.   Originally I booked the suite package with garden view (about 6 months out), however about one month out I notice that the package price had come done and the suite rooms with city views were much cheaper than the original garden room rates. You can’t change this online, however they are very responsive to emails and made this change for me.   The location was nice and every thing you need is located at this hotel. The club 55 was awesome and the pool was very nice.   Not sure if the honeymoon package was worth it as we didn’t get much more than what those who stay in the suites would of got. The price between the normal room price and honeymoon package was quite large for the little…",3,
"We are so surprised by the large pool and its scale ! We spent so much time at the pool more than the room , this is also the reason why we come here . We heard many good things about the swimming pool so when we checked the hotel the first thing we do is to see the pool! It is such a surprised so stunning and big !   The hotel is very big and there are shopping malls and restaurants around it so it is very convenient. Many Taiwanese people like to go to Singapore to see what a high technology country it is in Singapore ! We know that the service in big hotel is not like the service in small hotel , that’s why we did not expect too much . How can you run a large hotel and still ask for perfect service but we were lucky the person check us in was a nice gentleman also speaks good…",5,
stayed here couple of times! you can shop eat party and relax! start our day with a wide selection of breakfast then to the pool. Went for shopping at the shops! Enjoy sundowners in Spago!. And partied till night at Celavi!,5,
"The hotel has the worst check in I have ever seen, so long! I had a suite which had nothing special but the view over the city, it was magical. The real interest of the hotel is definitely the pool which is just amazing even though a bit crowded. Anyway I have loved the pool  and watching the sun going down with such a breathtaking view. ",4,
"Rooms were very generous. The view over the city was great. The pool area is amazing and a lovely spot to relax. The size of the hotel does make the lobby feel a bit like an airport, and the restaurants are very busy - be prepared to queue. I prefer a more intimate hotel.",4,
How to explain. This hotel is amazing from all the point of view!!! Stunning views in the roof top and swimming infinity pool! Amazing architecture built 3 huge towers empty at the bottom. This place is like a gigantic city! It's impressive to see how many people can stay there in the same time!! It is completely out of human scale and that is why is fascinating and worths a visit. But the truth it that it is so expensive that with one day night it's enough!! It's a crazy experience to do at least once in a lifetime!!!! ,4,
"Amazing hotel, it’s not cheap to stay, so if you are on a tight budget, I would recommend staying elsewhere. Checking in took quite some time, and our rooms were not ready so we had to leave our luggage with them, and this was delivered to our room once available. The rooms are large and very comfortable, plenty of extra pillows etc. We were in tower 3 on the 6th floor, had a very nice view of the Gardens by the bay. We used room service, food was amazing and hot, came on a table with a little heater underneath to keep the food hot, used the MiniBar, which was expensive, but they are in all hotels.  Spent a few hours on the SkyDek which has the famous infinity pool, it was freezing, so a quick in photo and out, the Jacuzzi’s were much better and worth a visit. I recommend going…",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands a couple of months ago and it was just wonderful.  We booked one of the Club rooms and it was really worth it. We were on the 47th floor with a city view and it was quite special. The room and bathroom were enormous. Having access to Club 55 made the extra cost of the Club Room totally worth it, we went up for the cocktail hour and having champagne and canapés was a lovely way to start the evening. We also had breakfast here, which we were very glad of when we saw the long queues (30 minutes plus!) for the restaurants on the ground floor as we headed out to start our day.  We were also very grateful for the fast track check in for Club rooms - we were whisked past the enormous queue and taken to an air conditioned room and given a seat and…",5,
"Exceptional, very clean beautiful hotel, from flowers from the lobby to check in with water, easy check in,room is comfortable with comfy beds, pools, service, just one word , views all exceptional , stayed 3 nights, pool view is amazing and breathtaking ",5,
Stayed 2 nights in Singapore at the Marina bay sands and had a pleasant stay.  Nothing special  Breakfast was ok  Pool has a great view.  Room was clean  Staff aren't as friendly as other resorts and hotels.  But please check your bill on departure as they tried to charge us for breakfast which we had already paid in our package. And other guests also had this problem on checking out.  If we used the express check we would have been charged and none the wiser ,2,
"Really enjoyed our One Night stay in Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Their staffs are very accommodating especially the skypark attendant in the pool area Dennis, James and Didi. Looking forward for another staycation in MBS again. :)",5,
"WE booked four room sa the Marina Bay Sands Singapore from Mar. 28 until April 1, 2018.  I am on the first night in one fo the four rooms and definitely the hotel could use a lot of improvement.  The state of the hotel is so far from that of Macau hotel casinos and I am comparing it to Macau because of the casinos, in fact Countdown hotel in Macau which used to be Hard Rock Hotel is so much better in cleanliness and standards comapred to MBS.  First of all, our room air conditioning unit is so hot that we had to request for a repairman at 2 in the morning, the pillow cases smell like they were wahsed and not dried enough -- you know what I mean, the smell of undried linen, the bathroom smells like a bathroom of an airplane, exact smell.  I do not know whether it is the Singapore…",2,
"Amazing hotel, swimming pool on the roof, perfect services, clear and quite. Staff very helpful. Everything the first class.  I recommended for all who will be in Singapore. I have to go to this hotel next time. ",5,
"A lot more expensive than any other hotel in the area, but we booked it exclusively for the pool and it didn’t disappoint. View from our room wasn’t bad either. Food and drink is slightly overpriced here but I guess they feel if you can afford the room rate you can afford the extras.  Pool can get quite crowded with people taking selfies and a lot of kids, but there is an adult only section too. Probably wouldn’t stay again - checked off the bucket list lol",5,
"My friends and I stayed one night in this hotel to experience this impressive building, enjoy the rooftop pool, admire the view, etc. I really recommend the Sky Gardens (the rooftop), the restaurants there are really good. The best part was sipping a cocktail on the terrace, and enjoying the jacuzzis on the other side of the infinity pool.  Special thanks to staff @Pek and @KevinTeng for their amazing service!",5,
"The hotel is huge, overlooking the marina and it does seem like you can’t escape it wherever you go. That said, it looks amazing from so many different view points and at night also. Be prepared for a lot of people taking photographs.   The hotel lobby is impressive but the drinks are overpriced. $9:50 for a cup of tea, and about $20 for a beer!   We were upgraded to a club room. It was great. Bed was huge and covered in rose petals as it was our honeymoon! We got chocolates on arrival also. View of the city was also fab.   Rooftop pool is something else!! It’s  probably not the most relaxing as there are lots of kids in the pool and again, lots of people taking selfies but we took plenty too!   Staff couldn’t do enough to help you, which was nice.   Overall, it was great to…",5,
"If you want to stay at this for being able to access the swimming pool make sure that you book the room on the highest floors, otherwise you will end up sleeping on the side of the shopping mall or even on the side of the road. Windows are not sound proof, meaning that you can hear every car passing by. The pool and the bars are the only facilities worth visiting. However you need to wake up and be at the pool at 7am the latest to have a spot. Will never stay here again.",2,
"We all know about the amazing number of staff, the supposed attention to detail and the high standards...but MBS really lacks any sort of personal touch. You are made to feel like just another piece of cattle, even though you spend 500$ per night. Don't get me wrong, the place is nice but you can get better in SG.",3,
"We went here in a restrauent at night and everything about this place is so lovely... A great hotel building, they have a shopping mall at the ground floor too, and amazing views of the city from top floor (56th floor), would love to stay in this hotel for atleast a night.",5,
"The facilities and amenities available at this hotel are world leading, of this I have no doubt and you do not need to read this review to know this. Aspects of the hotel are truly exceptional. There were some disappointments during our stay making this stay rather mixed which I have highlighted below:  1) Check- in process takes 1 hour while you wait in the queues. Handing out free Cornettos and Cold drinks do help... Got there to a lady who does not speak clear English. I had travelled with my wife and two toddlers who were not pleased.   2) As a result of the poor check-in process and lack of English from the lady, we arrived to a room with only 1 kingside bed and a cot for 4 of us. Being rather annoyed, I brought this up with the service manager (I was angry and upset at…",3,
"We had two nights there.The room is modern designed, has floor-to-ceiling windows with river view and able to see the Merlion statue from our room! Every evening, there are a firework show by the river and we are able to see it through our room as well. The shower room is very spacious with clawfoot tub, and shower room. The roof pool skylark is marvelous with amazing city view. But don't be surprised if you see a lot of people all the time.     The hotel are connected to Casino (just downstair) and shopping center, very convenient to all the attractions.",4,
"We only stayed on night and while it was lovely, there are far better experiences to take advantage of in Singapore. The pool was nice but I got extremely burnt even after being completely covered in sunscreen (and I don't burn that easily). I saw a lot of other people at the pool area in the same situation. Nice having access to a gym and dining close by. It does take forever to get around because the place was so huge. I have my photo in the pool for Insta so I am good for a lifetime. I will stick to Airbnbs for that more 'authentic' feel.",4,
"Where do I start!!! What an amazing hotel and more than we expected. It’s a bucket list must!!!!!!.I was expecting a lot from the MBS and Singapore and neither disappointed. The view, food and the atmosphere made our stay unforgettable. We will return one day many thanks to all the staff. Oh and book the breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks with canapés deal it’s well worth it. We got a huge king room overlooking the city.....just stunning. ",5,
"We booked 3 rooms .We were upgraded to a presidential suite which was marvelous. The views were incredible. The location of the hotel,the staff,The restaurants were great. Especially Lavo and breakfast at rice.highly recommend this hotel",5,
"We booked the hotel as a special treat to us and our boys and it was totally worth it! Not only did we get to check in hours before the actual check-in time, we were also given a later checkout at no extra charge. Everyone was friendly and service-oriented. Worth the money!!!",5,
"First things first, the bucket list has been looked out and marina bay sands has been ticked off. The rooms and pool are amazing and almost justify the price. The building itself is awe inspiring but can be overwhelming and the celebrity restaurants in the mall are poor and over priced. The staff were fine, the pool was instagram worthy. Be prepared to walk... a lot.... it can take a good 15 minutes to get from the front of the building to your room... I would certainly recommend for anyone who like us, wanted the experience. However maybe not for anyone seeking a relaxing getaway. ",4,
"We cruised into Singapore and stayed at the MBS during the Grand Prix... what an awesome experience overlooking the race track and seeing the action from the infinity pool !! Our room was superb, very large and very well appointed as you would expect for the price. Dining was on the expensive end but we just wanted to eat out and explore as you do in Singapore. Staff were very helpful with ideas of where to visit during this peak period. Would definitely stay here again.",5,
"My son was desperate to try the pool so we stayed here for two nights.   A different experience.   The lobby is like five different immigration offices placed in a blender and then released on the main floor. There is a long line just to check in. Although it did move along and the wait wasn’t horrible.   Very assembly line approach, but with a hotel this large there is probably no other approach that would work as well.   We were in Tower One. Room was really lovely. Excellent placement of outlets and the room was planned out very nicely. Nicer than expected.   The attraction of course was the pool, which is unique. There is no shade or umbrellas and sitting right near the pool is great but offers no shade whatsoever There are some cooler spots alongside the pool but not…",4,
"Perhaps I just was looking to have fun no matter what but I truly loved my one night at the Marina Bay Sands.  Of course, it is a big tourist attraction with casino and high-end shopping.  And be warned, there are families galore.  However, it is also a place that to me uniquely handled such masses of people in a way that you did not feel there were tons!  From finding a chair at the pool to getting a table at the amazing Adrift restaurant it all just worked.  Perhaps we were there during a slower spell but it seemed rather busy.  The pool for me lived up to the expectation and is worth one night of accommodation!",5,
"We had an amazing stay at the MBS.  First you can only appreciate the building, probably the best of Singapour. Then the room was great and service excellent. The room is quite huge, the bathroom nice, everything is there so nothing to point out. However be careful with the fridge, it is charging the room by weight mesure so silly thing but when you put water in the fridge and you put aside something to make room, it will charge the room. To continue on very good point you can also mention the magnificent inifinity pool and view on the city (you don’t have to queue or pay for the skye deck when you are staying at the hotel).  We didn’t tried the breakfast nor than the club on the roof (but once again you don’t have to pay the entrance when you’re staying at the hotel).  We will…",5,
"We were able to check in early, which was great after a long flight.  Room was great and service in the restaurants and bars absolutely fine.  It is just a massive hotel and all that goes with it.  Very similar to the Las Vegas resort hotels.",3,
"Stayed 3 nights at the hotel and whilst the infinity pool was the main attraction in selecting this hotel we also wanted access to the Club room as it is much easier to get dietary requirements in a small, intimate area.  Did I say small?  The area was huge and not at all like club rooms at other 5 star hotels where one can ask reception to check airline tickets, room availability, check-out etc.  Not here.  The area is strictly for eating.  Of a night during ""happy hour"" sometimes there is a 30 person waiting line at reception awaiting table allocation as seating is limited.  The food available for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks is varied and plentiful and of a reasonable quality.  The wines and spirits offered between 5 - 7 pm is quite extensive and the wines…",4,
"We stayed only 1night but we should have stayed at least 2-3nights. Hotel is huge, good location. nearby the Garden. Room is nice and comfortable. nice view, also. The best was a pool.  i really love the pool. ",4,
speed three days. it was really an amazing place to stay.services excellent and nice place to spend family time.sure we will back for some pleasant time again..if you have planning to go to Singapore..please dont miss that place ,5,
"There is no doubt that this property is stunning and has provided Singapore with a real focal point. However a property cannot be judged by looks alone it is service which counts. We and some friends had booked 2 club rooms with lounge access. 2 days before we arrived I received an e-mail with check in details and told to go to Sands Lounge in Tower 1 - excellent. When you enter Tower 1 it is like Waterloo station at rush hour! The entrance to the Sands Lounge is not immediately obvious. Even for Club Rooms the check in process was time consuming and operates on a ticket system like a supermarket delicatessen. First impressions are important and we did not feel like valued guests. The room was excellent, good size, all the amenities you would expect of this standard of hotel and…",3,
We stayed for one night on our last night in Singapore yes this hotel is expensive but for the opportunity to swim in the infinity pool it was worth it.  We were upgraded to a suite which was huge and views over the gardens by the bay was amazing. The service from staff was friendly and helpful we were even treated with some delicious complimentary macaroons. The infinity pool was a highlight amazing to be able to swim on top of the building and have views across Singapore enjoyed our stay wishing it was for longer but happy we got to experience this hotel,5,
"We stayed here during a business trip for my husband.  Hotel is huge, impressive - a bit impersonal because of size.  Rooms are comfortable- pool is amazing!  Location is good - close to Gardens by the Bay.  ",4,
The hotel itself is expensive but you can visit the bar at the top with great views over the city. $20 to go up but that's also towards your drinks. (Drinks are crazy expensive too though!),5,
"The pool - the pool - the pool!  So much fun.  Great room -- great service -- great restaurants.  We particularly loved Adrift, db and Cut.  The food was yummy and the service could not have been better.  Also enjoyed the Club.  Very gracious staff.  This is our second stay here and look forward to returning.",5,
"I took tickets for me and my family and went up, to Skydeck. The lobby was like an airport. Still staffs were very supportive and we could easily find our lift. The Sky deck give a wonderful, breathtaking view of Singapore city. The pool is not available for visitors, It is for who stay at the hotel. But Sky deck is amazing. We reached there at 4pm. We could enjoy the beauty of sunset. We could not experience the beauty of the Singapore at night from the deck because our flight was at 10 andwe had to leave soon. whoever visit Singapore, please visit Sky Deck. It is worthful.",5,
"When you first look at the hotel your jaw drops, the building is absolutely stunning! There are three towers with a boat sitting on top! When you approach the hotel there are many taxis you can grab but it can be extremely busy! If you are staying at the hotel, whatever room you have look out the window and there will be a breath taking view looking out across Singapore! When you go to the very top you feel like your on a boat floating in the air, there is an infinity pool that stretches along the side of the boat and if you aren’t staying at the hotel you can still grab a drink at the bar! Overall it’s a masterpiece there is not one bad thing about it!",5,
"Long story short goes like this...  VERY excited for our first stay at MBS, after visiting and dreaming of it for 5 years. It’s VERY expensive, but we’ve got an event onsite and decide to spring for it. And just to do it right, we booked the Orchid Suite, 97 sqm of panache.  We get to the room to discover a complete let down. The room is nice...but CAN’T be more than 65sqm. Am I splitting hairs? Maybe, but it felt VERY small, and at 2/3 the quoted size, that’s a big difference. It’s unfair.   So I call the front desk, convinced that we got the wrong room. “Does your room have a bath tub? Then it’s an Orchid Suite.” Yes but it’s tiny. “No, it’s 97sqm. We checked the website. And the hotel is booked up, but maybe we can check if another similar room is avail.”  After a bunch of…",2,
"***I have only given this 4 stars for the Service, the experience and the views.*** The end of the day this hotel is just one for the bucket list, get the t-shirt and don’t go back. I like good quality but I know when I’m paying too much for something and this hotel was that! Everything was not worth the price tag that was put on it.  ",4,
"Spent two night at this fantatstic hotel mid February 2018. Had a garden view room on the 37th floor in tower 3. The views over the bay gardens and beyond where great, we even had a small balcony. The check-in process in tower 1 was effecient. The ground floor of the hotel had many places to eat, with a few small shops and direct access to the casino, shopping mail (enormous) and city train system. As such the ground floor was always very busy. Obtain a Sands loyalty card on arrival and this will get you discounts at the many restuarants as they can be quiet expensive. Our room was very spacious and well appointed with a large Queen bed. The bathroom had separate toilet and shower areas. The icing on the cake was the roof top Infinity pool area only accessilbe if you stay at the…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a huge hotel, beautifully located at the Marina Bay. The rooms either have view of the Bay or the Gardens by the Bay. When entering the hotel, you'll see a lot of people, not only guests. At first you feel a bit lost, because of the enormous hall and many people. Once you get used to it, no problem anymore. The hotel offers standard rooms and Club rooms. Club rooms have a separate check in room, which is very comfortable. We booked the Club King City View room for 2 nights. Wow what a view! Room is absolutely not cheap, but located on the 42 floor with a breathtaking view is really something! A large room with kingbed and area with sofa and easy chairs and a working desk. The bathroom also large with very special bathtub and separate toilet and separate…",4,
I expect most people thinking of going here want to experience the view from the infinity pool overlooking Singapore (and probably take a selfie)... it’s mesmerising but extremely busy at peak times so be warned.   What is amazing about this hotel is it’s shear size and efficiency. Everything is done to extremely high standards by friendly and helpful staff.  It’s a great location and stopover hotel but I don’t think a week here is necessary...  Definitely 5 stars but there is a lack of soul due to the size and machine like nature of the hotel. ,5,
"The staff was courteous, friendly & helpful. The room was comfortable & we had a good view. The view from the pool was breathtaking but the pool itself was quite crowded. We only stayed a night but overall we had an enjoyable stay although it didn't feel as luxurious as we expected considering it's a rather pricey hotel.",3,
"I had wanted to stay at the Marina bay ever since I first seen pictures of people in the rooftop pool and decided to treat my partner and I to a night here while visiting Singapore.   At $600 a night it is safe to say this hotel is on the higher end of the scale. I have stayed at hotels in Singapore that are just as nice, provide a much better service and are only 33% of the price you will pay at Marina Bay.   However, if you want to get into the pool area you have no other choice. The pool area is amazing and the views are out of this world! The bar prices are a little steep, 4 drinks set us back SG$100.   The rooms are spacious, clean and if you are on a higher floor they have great views of the gardens/city.   Despite paying SG$600 a night I was surprised that the mini bar…",4,
We have $600 bond to be held by the hotel and they still have not returned back to us!! If you really care about your own business then you should not lie to us about 1 month returning bond! Return it,1,
"Wonderful stay and service, Again. We are back again to MBS and just like our previous stays, we love it. The customer service, food, and the room are what we always expect from MBS. This time we stayed at Tower 1, the room was spectacular, clean, and very spacious. The room interior always reminded me of Bellagio in Las Vegas. Had a great time at the Casino too!",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a definite must to go see, explore, and experience. The Observation Deck is the perfect place to get photos of the entire city from the 57th floor elevation. The infinity pool is awesome, but you must be a guest in the hotel to have access to it. Rooms are expensive, but then again everything in Singapore is expensive. While we were there, I saw an announcement on the TV that Singapore, for the 5th year in a row, is declared the country with the highest cost of living in the world. A small glass of wine was $28 SGD ($21 USD)",5,
"The room that we had was spacious, tidy and luxurious. The bathroom was absolutely amazing something I would like to have someday. Everything you could ever ask for in a hotel room, MBS has it. The city view from the infinity pool is just enchanting and gorgeous though crowded. Food is great, too. However, checking in and out takes awhile and you have to stand in queue. Should provide some seats for the guests.",5,
The staff was very courteous from the concierge to the reception staff to the waiting staff. The check in was smooth and we had booked 2 Premier rooms but they gave us a family room as Premier rooms were not available. The restaurants were amazing and we stayed in tower 2. The infinity pool has great views of the city and the docks on the other side. ,5,
"Even though I believe this hotel is extremely expensive, the rooms are luxurious and clean, but the pool is something else. It totally repays the price for one night.  There is no shuttle to the airport, but even ealry in the morning it should be okay to find a taxi.",5,
"The pool is worth the money alone it is amazing, there are plenty of sun beds, lovely fresh pool towels, waiter service everything you could want. Our room was spacious and very comfortable with a lovely big balcony. Housekeeping was excellent and nothing too much trouble. We upgraded so we could use the lounge for afternoon tea and evening aperitifs and cocktails, it was well worth the extra expense.  The only things that stop me giving this a 5 rating is checkin was slow and there was no concierge to help with bags or show how things worked in the room and at £450 a night it was very expensive but for us it was worth it for the experience. The other disappointment was we were allocated a room on the 10th floor and I really wanted to be higher however it was Chinese New Year…",4,
"I was asked on the Marina Bay Survey if they created Unforgettable Memories for me? To answer them I have to say Yes they did, but it was not worth the money we spent. The long lines at the curb delayed us from even arriving at the door. We actually got out of the taxi and walked about 100 years to the door dragging our bags so we just didn't sit in the car.  Too many people everywhere and long waits to eat.  Too many people also for what there is offered, so I am glad I only booked one night. The one good thing the hotel has going for it, is the training of their people.  Everyone we had the pleasure to meet were very friendly and helpful.",3,
We debated on how long we wanted to stay here given the heavy price tag. So we opted it for one night - 1. given we only have 2 nights for Singapore and 2. we wanted to enjoy some sightseeing rather than spending our entire time at the pool.  But if you can stomach the price tag then by all means stay as long as you want (it is a very comfortable hotel).  We moved to Naumi hotel for the 2nd night.  Our deluxe twin room (cheapest room type) was surprisingly spacious (I can only imagine how much bigger the other room types are).  We had an amazing view of the bay on the 37th floors at tower 3.  The room had everything you would need except for 2 things - 1. our safe didn’t work so we were without a safe given we didn’t have time for a new safe. 2. lack of a fridge as the one in…,4,
"This was my first trip to this hotel. I had gone for a conference which was in the same hotel so i choose to stay here I got my room in tower 3 and had entered from tower 1 now that was a long way especially when i had to do this everyday for the conference. View from the hotel was fantastic. Staff courteous and the infinity pool excellant Its a mini city in itself. Casino,Night club,restaurants,malls attached to it.  It reminded me of those Big  Vegas kind of hotels very crowded. But if you are looking for coziness and that boutique hotel experience this is definitely not the place I liked the express checkout counters they have all over .It definitely saves a lot of time going to the reception and waiting",4,
"+ Excellent Customer Service! Well Done MBS :) Have been to so many luxury hotels and your employees are very well trained to delight customers.. + Conveniently located / Connected to EXPO, Shops and Restaurants + Access to Great Food Outlets - Celebrity Chefs + Good Facilities  - Too Massive - No Quaint luxury feel - Roof Top Pool too crowded and cramped - Gym gets too crowded too probably need one in every tower",4,
"I got very disappointed. It was my last night on my trip over Asia after Thailand and Malaysia.  First the hotel hall is so crowded. It was insane. The queue for the checkin is just a joke : around 20 minutes. Surprise, you have to paid also a refundable deposit ?!   My room was big. The view was great, on the garden by the bay.  However I thought the bathroom had a bit of a smell and I could perfectly hear the road near by the hotel. For a 5* hotel and at that price that is absolutely not normal.   Concerning the pool it was beautiful. Lots of people too but ok. The water was cold. Not heated ?  One of the best story of the stay is the check out. First it was to try to go to downstairs form the 8th floor. I waited around 15 minutes for an elevator. All of them were packed of…",3,
"The hotel is very clean, large rooms and a very nice pool but for the price don't stay here many nights. The pool is unique and everbody is in the pool with their mobiles to take pictures of the breath taking view. Prices in the pools are expensive around 16 USD for a beer! Don't get drunk here. If you want a nice experience for 1 or 2 nights stay at the hotel if you want a long vacation choose another place which has a lower price.",4,
"We went to look around and met a blonde English lady, I think was called Suzie, she extremely helpful and explained a lot about the high bar and also information about Singapore, the high bar is definitely worth a visit, cocktails are very nice. X ",5,
"We had an amazing stay at the Marina Bay hotel in Singapore. The service is outstanding,they were extremely kind and helpful,from the waiter at the dining room to the management- everyone are willing to assist with  pleasure to any request or question. There are a wide veraity of restaurants and the food is super delicious. The pool located on the top of the building and the view is just spectacular! The hotel is well  maintained and clean.  We already look forward to come back to another unforgattable exeprience.  Jacob Sudri",5,
"If you had to be in Singapore, you have to be in Marina Bay Sands. Everything is just around, the merlion, gardens by the bay, amazing view of the city landscape and a science museum. Not to forget the famous Infinity pool.  Plan a day stay here and visit the gardens in the afternoon and linger around the marina bay mall and merlion in the evening.",5,
"The tower give extravaganza view to the city, inside there were so many high end brand name shop. Should have had the power socket for battery charging area. The restaurant is limited and very crowded.",4,
"We booked our boss who was visiting from overseas so he could enjoy the pool and the view. Although room was ok and dinner at Celavi was fine, he had a terrible experience, he could not have breakfast due to extremely long queue on a Saturday morning and could not use the pool either, crowded too. In the end he checked out and went for late breakfast at the Fullerton hotel. Total fail for us, never again.",2,
Rooms nicer than expected with Vegas feel.  Pool is absolutely spectacular and worth paying the room rate for at least one night.   Check in was efficient and friendly.  We had appetizers and drinks at the lobby bar as well as up by the pool.  Great service and food.  Good for a quick one night stay. ,5,
"Wow. It sure was a stay with a difference. .Check in looked like it was gonna be chaos, but since we Aussies stood out amid the throng of Japanese we  were approached  and given a private and super speedy greeting . Thanks a million management. Our room was slightly smaller than the average luxe hotel but the facilities were great and the view out over the Singapore gardens was fabulous. And as for the pool views- wow!. Young Japanese girls EVERYWHERE, in couples and groups, all taking selfies of themselves in every conceivable position and place.. and the views over the edge weren't bad either.   .",4,
"What an amazing hotel, service was superb, rooms were lovely and big, housekeeping was faultless.  The infinity pool was awesome and the choice and quality of hotels was just perfect.  My husband arranged for a special breakfast for my birthday, it was perfect and was delivered to the room.  The hotel lobby can get a little busy but the floors are quiet and elevators are quick.  The Marina mall is attached to the hotel as is the tube station, which is lovely when the heat outside is so hot.  We loved it here and will certainly be coming back ",5,
"Besides the obvious benefits of this hotel (the building, pool and surrounding amenities), the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was amazing and offered great views.   I would definitely recommend a stay at MBS! ",5,
The pool on the roof was amazing. The house keeping  was perfect. We got a wheelchair for my husband and we were able to visit  the nice Seafood paradise restaurant with its excellent lobsters.The view from the balcony to the Gardens by the bay was very beautiful.,5,
"We checked into The Marina Bay Sands on our last day in Singapore (4th March) before heading to Thailand. We arrived much earlier than the 2pm check in at around 10:30am..but we’re not treated any different, our bags were taken off us and we were given temporary keycards to use the facilities including the infinity pool. I was then very efficiently emailed when our room was ready and headed to reception to collect our keys. When we got to the room the bags were there already :) The room itself was stunning! The view made it and is what we had paid for.. The pool is amazing.. and wasn’t that overcrowded - we even managed to get some good selfies! The shoppes were as expected, high end and very luxurious but the hotel and it’s clientele we’re not snobby or rude like in London.. I…",5,
"WOW WOW that's your first impression from a distance and the closer you get this piece of engineering marvel takes your breath away. Three incredible towers with this remarkable surfboard shape structure rests on top of the towers.  So your asking, Why stay here since it's like wholly bloody hell expensive a night. Is it for the beautiful modern rooms right? And if there is 3 of you than you get a rollout bed for that price. Maybe the Lobby? Which has a peak hour train station feel about it with people asleep on furniture and floor in lobby and waiting to get there room key card by 3pm or in a long que to still check in. It could be the huge Casino? Which you need your foreign passport on you which gets revised longer than any Customs officer at the airport. There's also the…",4,
"The only part I enjoyed about this place was the views from the Skydeck.  Such a busy place, people everywhere.  We had a drink in the Skydeck and I must say, the staff were atrocious, very bad mannered and are definitely not good ambassadors for the Hotel.",4,
"I stayed in the Marina Bay Sands on my last night in Singapore to end our 10 day trip of travelling, it was a treat. I chose to stay here just the one night to spend the last day in Singapore up on the roof top. This was one of the highlights of the trip, it was a good experience, I wouldn't stay more than one night as it is expensive but it was a nice way to end the trip. My first roof top infinity pool experience, it was lovely. Saw the sunset and the financial district light up as it got darker. We were not very high, floor 18 with the views of the bay, which over looked the Gardens by the Bay.",5,
"It’s a huge place but run very efficiently. As a business traveller you need a lobby to meet, drink and sometimes a quick meal. This place doesn’t have that. It’s an impressive set up but not for me. Sky bar is worth a visit but is busy and noisy. My 2/5 rating is only my view of the total offer not a reflection on the operating staff",2,
"Enjoyed our stay there. Loved the garden view and love the scent of the shower gel, shampoo & conditioner. Feels so refreshing. I thought the remote controlled curtains were fantastic as I felt like royalty. The swimming pool at the rooftop had a fantastic view and it was awesome. ",5,
"Overrated, overpriced and terrible service. I've stayed in lots of hotels but this one takes the cake for being overrated and overpriced. Asian hotels are usually renowned for exceptional service. This place is only one step better than rude. There are lots of exceptional hotels in Singapore for about 1/3 of the price so my best advice is find somewhere else.",2,
We stayed in this hotel for five nights in a King View Club room on the 35th floor.  The room is large with good views over the bay and city from the bedroom/lounge area and views out over the Gardens by the Bay and the sea beyond with all the ships waiting to dock.  Our flight arrived early and as our room wasn’t ready we were given keys to go up to the gym to shower and change.  We spent a few hours up beside the infinity pool.  The pool is spectacular but so crowded – mostly with young people taking selfies.   We walked around the shops nearby which are nearly all designer outlets and we seldom saw any customers in them in the five days we were there.  But it is good to get some exercise walking around the shopping area in the aircon and it is all beautifully clean and the…,4,
"Marina Bay Sands is indeed a spectacular hotel in Singapore, aside from it's architectural design that wows tourist all around the world, they're also famous in their infinity pool in which is located at the 57th floor or the top most part of the hotel and is the highest and the longest infinity pool in the world.  ​ Starting at $4oo sgd a night, this luxurious hotel is really costly but worth every money spent.",5,
"Yes it's busy, yes it's brash but what an experience. Stayed pretty high up on the 37th floor with outstanding views. Great room, lovely bedlinen, loads of space, good AC, nothing really to fault. Breakfasts were outstanding as were all restaurants (we tried 6). The rooftop bar & restaurants are of course spectacular & busy & fun........a real blowout experience. Magic.",5,
"This hotel sure was just a gambling hotel without any personalised service at all. Overly priced especially the club room and package include complimentary breakfast, high tea and evening cocktails & lounge but the food was ordinary not worth the money. As for service wise check in staff unfriendly without smile & they look overwork stress thats how they give guest a feeling of unwelcome. I have stay a few times prior to this review each time they have not improved their service felt very disappointed. As for the infinity swimming pool is always overcrowded with people & even to enter the pool the security make ones feel unwelcome like u are entering some high security swiss bank they keep having to verify if room card key faulty etc and wont allowed extra guest to even enter to…",1,
"Great infrastructure and probably the best hotel to stay in Singapore. It is huge and the location is too good if you wish to enjoy your stay in Singapore. Everything is so easily accessible. Surrounded by Gardens By the bay, Singapore Flyer and Singapore Harbor, it is comfortable the best hotel to stay in.",5,
"Was there last week for a business conference and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, conveniently connected underground to the convention centre with a huge shopping centre attached as well its truly a self contained conference location, and i really loved the roof top infinity pool on the 57th floor. The concierge staff was also fabulous. I would definitely recommend it. ",5,
"What a stunning hotel. It’s ludicrous really - three huge towers, and then they stuck a huge banana shaped slab on top and put an infinity pool, 4 restaurants, and a couple of bars on top. Oh, and some jacuzzis as well. Completely crazy, but mind blowing.  Staff were excellent. Check-in a bit sluggish (queues form - you might want to try the check-in at the base of tower 3 if the main one is busy). Rooms are really lovely, high quality fixtures & fittings, very comfortable, excellent shower, and very soundproof.  The restaurants get VERY busy for breakfast, with waits of up to 30 minutes to get a table at 8am which is crazy. Breakfast is phenomenal though - loads and loads of choice. Fill up and skip lunch.  The pool is of course amazing. Absolutely incredible.  Downsides are…",4,
"My partner and I stayed at The Marina Bay Sands in February 2018 for two nights, it was one of the places to visit on my travel list.  On arrival it felt like i had arrived at a huge shopping mall, mob of people waiting for taxis outside the hotel.  Lobby felt strange too as it had a feel of a shopping mall full of people rather than a five star hotel.  Checkin had a long queue and the staff behind the counters were simply there to do a job, there was no element of customer relations involved in the check in process.  The answers to every request at this stage was a simple ""NO"" as they were fully booked.    Once we got to the room, we were pleasantly surprised by the view and the size of the room.  We had a room facing the city which in the night was absolutely breathtaking. …",4,
"We booked a club room for an additional fee and must say: Worth every nickel! Check in in a separate lobby fùr club members, no waiting! Superb bed, bath, balcony and so on and so on. Most incredible is the pool on the rooftop with 124m length. Looking down to the bay or on the other side to the gardens is a great view.  Nice bars, restaurants a d shopping mall.",5,
"Location of this hotel was located at the foot of the Singapore Gardens, accessible by a foot bridge.  Our room was spacious, clean, providing plenty of tea and coffee and toiletries.  We had a spacious balcony with a panorama view of the gardens below, we certainly enjoyed the lights lit up later from our balcony. The bed was good and enjoyed a good nights sleep. Reception gave us a temporary card when we arrived as we were early for check in.  We enjoyed a share lunch, hamburger, chips and a couple of beers, on the top floor which housed the huge infinity pool with views of Singapore below.  It was very crowded and lunch was 100 Singapore dollars.",5,
I stayed with my fiancé for one night after attending a conference in Singapore just to experience the hotel after having it on our bucket list for years!  We had a large club room with king size bed over looking the city. This was ready early when we checked in so we got an extra few hours. Check in was lovely in the club member check in area.   We used the amazing infinity pool during the day but a night it was incredible. The view was stunning. There are also hot jacuzzis on the opposite side over looking the gardens on the bay which is great as it can be a little cold and windy in the main pool.   We watched the light show from our room on the 49th floor which was pretty cool!  The afternoon tea is nice but the complimentary 2 hours of drinks and canapés is to die for and…,5,
"I really wish I could be more positive, especially as my friend and I were looking extremely forward to our stay at MBS for over a year.   Upon check-in I was told that my room was on the 17th floor and ""facing the shopping center roof"", implying that I would get an obstructed view; I was then asked if I wanted to upgrade to a larger room in a much higher floor with the food/club privileges for $250 more a night. I was in a very good mood and thought about it, but something seemed off about the offer. Had it been a lot less it would have possibly been worth it for the convenience of not having to leave the hotel for food, but one of my main reasons for coming to SG was to try the local food and it wasn't a big deal for me to take the train 1-2 stops to go somewhere more…",4,
It’s an iconic building in Singapore. Really recommended for pleasure or business since you can basically live walking distance.   The roof top it was very cool and unique.   Bring your shoes and run around the bay.   It’s a wow wow experience. ,5,
Its expebsive long queues property whether check in or breakfast in the morning.  Their swimming pool is certainly sought after. But other than that the property and the rooms are very basic. They won't even get you basic cookies for free. One suggestion they shouldn't allow out guests for bkfst to avoid long queues.,4,
"Stayed here for three nights, for a conference at the adjoining venue. Standard deluxe room on 50th floor, facing the harbor. Great sunrises on the harborside, and glittery lights on the cityside from the spectacular rooftop pool. The service was superb from all the employees we interacted with. We had dinner across the bay at the Fullerton Hotel and got to watch the brilliant light show emanating from the MBS and the buildings on the Promenade.",5,
"My wife and i celebrated our wedding anniversary at Marina Bay Sands. Check In was quick and easy although we did see it get busy a while later. We were given room 4101 which had city views and what fantastic views they are. The observation deck is perfect for photos, also i must point out Bay view rooms would be just as good, i was told bay view had balconies but cannot confirm. Our room was very nice and comfortable, length of bed could have helped a little bit more but overall i had a great sleep as the mattress was firm and to my liking. My wife loved the showerhead, it made the water feel super soft, could have stayed under it all day. If you intend on replacing drinks from the refrigerator be sure to let them know in advance so they can reprogram it as the sensors might…",5,
This is simply not a biz hotel. Lousy room conditions. Long queue for breakfast unless you get up really early. I waited 20min this morning. A long walk to the meeting venue and fairly hot.  Tourists trespassing everywhere,3,
"Had a great stay. Hotel is a little oversized, very much American theme. This was fine for us, but if if you want something a little more authentic, maybe not for you. Swimming pool can’t be beaten, as can’t the bars by the pool.",4,
"We only had one day in Singapore but had to see the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the giant trees park.  Easy access from downtown, unable to use pool without an expensive room but enjoyed the amazing view from the rooftop observation deck.  Enjoyed the giant tree forest and surrounding park. If you only have a day, well worth the experience.",5,
"It's an iconic hotel and was on the bucket list. We stayed at a room on the 55th floor at Marina Bay Sands. The room has very high ceilings and the bathrooms are enormous. We had a gorgeous balcony with view of the Gardens by the Bay. There's so much to do in the whole MBS complex (especially shopping!), you could spend your whole trip here without leaving – not that we recommend doing that, Singapore is an interesting and fascinating city with so much to do.  To get the best out of the infinity pool, you need to get up to go in the pool at 6 AM. You can see the sun rising over Singapore and it's truly stunning. The pool is otherwise uncomfortably busy in the daytime.",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a conference.  Though I typically detest monstrous properties, the facilities outweighed the size of the establishment.    Location was central, but the major advantage is that it is connected to the convention centre.  Concerning the stay, the facilities on the roof top are fantastic during the day time, and there are plenty of lovely night time options available too.  Rooms, as expected, are very functional and well appointed.  Make sure to try and get a green view room!",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is one of the ""Hotel Wonders of the World"".  From the incredible architecture, both from the outside and within the hotel, to the world class restaurants, the signature spa and the otherworldly vanishing edge pool on the 57th floor (150 meters long!), this hotel has it all.    In addition, the hotel staff is terrific, looking to please at every turn.  Here are a few tips:  if you are hungry, but want something simple, the Renku Bar in the lobby serves a bar food menu and everything the Renku restaurant serves.  Just ask for the restaurant menu (and talk to Zack and Jackie, two tremendous workers there, tending the bar and waiting tables....thanks to both of you for such outstanding service!).    The spa is over the top, and the copule's massage room is the…",5,
"Internet is not working, there are multiple javascript errors in their wifi login page. As a result you cannot complete the choice of the plan and connect. The IT team fixes this for few hours and then you need call them again and wait 30 minutes. Absolutely out of standard when you are rushing to a meeting. The hotel experience feels like a cash machine. There is not even a welcome snack or fruit and you even need to pay to watch movies and for  high speed wifi. Last, no one took my luggages when I got out of the taxi.",1,
"We stayed a single night in a club room before flying back to the UK the following day. The hotel is a world renowned landmark of Singapore set majestically at the front of the bay. Unfortunately this brings the only two downfalls I could think of during our stay, its rather expensive and very busy!  Despite the massive size of the hotel I never felt like the service suffered as a result, the staff were all very good and professional. We stayed here to access the infinity pool which is something of a once in a lifetime experience and was well worth it. The club room we had also provided a wonderful view over the gardens and the bay. We enjoyed complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapes as part of the club room privileges and made for a memorable experience.",5,
"Right from checkin to the room, and everything in between was great.  The room was great, I had to wait a little to get the room as I was early.  The pool is just amazing and the entire area is great.  Plenty of restaurants to choose from, and easy access to the mall, and the subway train station.  The is also a casino there, remember to take your passport with you.  I was there for a conference and it is very easy to get to just across the road.  The rooms are great, with good amenities, and plenty of plugs to charge all your gadgets, the bathrooms are functional and large.  The wifi in the hotel is great, and is accessible almost everywhere.  There is also a bridge walkway to get to the gardens by the bay.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,
"Large hotels are really not our scene but we made an exception for the Marina Bay. The whole stay was phenomenal. Our Premier room on the 44th floor with City View was just incredible. My wife and I agreed that it was the most impressive room that we have ever stayed in and we have travelled extensively. It was utterly immaculate with superb service from the staff. I should say that the staff throughout the property were wonderful and really made you feel that you were valued guest. Enough has already been said of the pool.... Unbelievable!!!   Yes, it is expensive but it is possible to eat authentic local food nearby for very little. My advice is to stay here and eat out but do have the buffet breakfast at least once. It is worth it. All in all a wonderful holiday in a world…",5,
"This is the new landmark of Singapore and I have to admit that it is one of the best pieces of modern architecture I have ever seen. Had been wanting to stay at this hotel for a long time, mostly (like everyone who stays there) for the infility pool on the 57th floor. The hotel is great, and even if it's an enormous bot check in and check out were extremely fast. Staff is very polite and friendly and the overall service is 5 star! I stayed in one of the premium rooms on the 34th floor and the room was really beautiful, spacious, rich without being vulgar, I have to say that I was really really happy with the room. I had breakfast at club 55 on the 55th floor and it was great, a beautiful view of the city and a great variety of food choices, again also here staff was very…",4,
"This attractive hotel convinced me with its friendly staff and beautiful infinity pool. It is quite expensive but worth a visit if you only stay for a couple of nights. We checked in on Valentines Day and I got a rose which is just a sweet detail. The hall and the underground shopping center offers a wide variety of breakfast options or further restaurants. The room is clean and modern, the room service adds little details like the towels that are in the form of an elephant or swans.   The rooftop bar is very expensive and there is a dresscode so you can not enter after your swim in the infinity pool. The pool is not heated so I recommend to visit during the day or just for a quick swim in the evening, but if it's windy you might get a bit freezing rapidly.   The metro is…",5,
"Must experience Hotel. Wonderful Rooms, great breakfast and other facilities. I stayed at this hotel for 2 days. Staff and service are friendly and satisfying. Rooms are spacious. It took me 45 minutes to check in.",5,
"visit for the view, the romanticism, the drinks, the atmosphere and just about anything else you may want...a must place to visit and spend quality time relaxing enjoying the view and the service provided by the staff",5,
"A major hotel like this ought to adapt to locals' behavior.  The strangest thing about some international hotels, even in Singapore, is the absence of a bidet in the toilet. A simple hand bidet would have been a quick and easy adaptation.  But I suppose it was too much a bother to have considered it.   Otherwise, this hotel may continue to boast of its reputation in spite of the lack.  Indeed I must admit it was a grand and huge complex.  The swim at L57's infinity pool was awesome, still just the one experience would suffice.  Show me a bidet and perhaps ... ",4,
"We did stay as a stopover. Not our first time in Singapore.  Marina Bay Sands is famous for its infinity pool and view.  We arrived and check in/checkout was easy. We could not find our room. We were given terrible instructions on where to find it.   We found our family room for  2 adults and two kids on the second floor above on of the restaurants.    A big modern room with good beds and linen. Big bathroom and spare toilet and wash room. The room was a meeting room in a prior life.  The staff were good being happy and helpful from concierge to bell boy , every single staff member was fine.  We went to the rooftop infinity pool.  It was interesting and clean . There was also so many people just looking around (not using) and the fact that all chairs were being used too gave it…",2,
Check in was crowded - somewhat expected as the hotel is very popular with tourists n locals.  But service was quick.  Room was spacious.  Room faces the Gardens.  Nice view at night.  Quiet environment.  Prompt service from housekeeping.  Enough eating outlets to cater for variety n choices.  Shopping slightly more high end.  Other shopping centres nearby n within reach by walking or MRT.  Use valet service - very efficient.  Price for one night - slightly higher than normal.  Good stay.,4,
"While quite expensive, a visit to the Marina Bay Sands should be on everyone’s bucket list.  The pool was unlike anything I’d ever seen.  Amazing views and very relaxing.  I’d recommend a night there for anyone, whether passing through or in Singapore for a longer visit.  I arrived early and emailed the hotel in advance.  I was able to check in at 6:00AM and immediately access my room and pool because the staff was aware of my expected arrival.  Unforgettable experience.",5,
"We stayed here 2 nights and paid extra to have access to club 55 and breakfast included. The hotel is great, nice tidy, clean but very pricey. Pool again is great but because we paid so much for the room nearly $1000 Singapore a night we didn’t want to leave.  Also it is quite big and always a lot of people everywhere down stairs. I would get breakfast as well as it was great! Ask for a city view as it would be better than the gardens",4,
"I visited MBS back in 2013, and although it was good, it wasn't great. I'm pleased to say that myself and my partner enjoyed a much better stay this time around, and we are already making plans to return.  Our check-in experience was quick and efficient. We received a very warm welcome and were able to check-in at 12pm, three hours earlier than our confirmed check-in time. We only waited 5 minutes to check-in too, which is impressive considering the size and scale of the hotel!  We booked a Premier room for 2 nights, and although we hadn't realised that we may need to pay extra for a room with a view, this was offered at a reasonable price of an extra S$35 per night (more for a city view room). We were allocated a stunning twin room on the 31st floor, with a beautiful view of…",5,
"We stayed at this hotel for over a week and had a stellar time.   The hotel is conveniently located close to Gardens by the Bay, and right on Marina Bay surrounded by incredible shopping, and top notch restaurants.    What cannot be overstated is the jaw dropping pool on the 57th floor, views both to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay.  The pool is an infinity pool that is open at 6am (before sunrise) and closes at 11pm.  We found going early in the morning was an ideal time before it got hot or later in the evening watching the light shows both at Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay.  We stayed on the 10th floor (3rd tower) overlooking the Gardens by the Bay, enjoying the views of the Gardens (especially at night) and the harbour.  I heard the rooms within this tower are smaller…",5,
"Great views to the city and the sea. The infinity pool is a must see. The service is nice. Is stayed one of the club rooms with the access to the club lounge for breakfast and evening drinks. Gym is nice,  facing the city with large windows. Stunning views too. Although you go for a run to the Gardens by the Sea. You clock up to 8-9 km, depending on the route. Plenty of restaurants, a night club and some bars on the rooftop. The hotel really big. The ground floor feels like an airport ona huge railway station :).",5,
"Our family of four (2 adults and 2 kids aged 9 and 11) had booked a club room for two nights in Marina Bay Sands. Unfortunately due to bad weather conditions in Europe our flight was delayed for 20 hours and we only managed to spend one night there. I honestly can not understand all the negative reviews here, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The club check-in was quick and the young man who checked us in was very kind and polite. He also checked us out the next morning and remembered our names! Unfortunately I do not remember his name. The club room was spacious, with a sofabed for the children to sleep on and a super comfortable king sized bed for us. The lounge and the bedroom could be separated with a sliding door. The bathroom was huge with a rainfall shower and a bath and…",5,
"I have to admit, I booked this place with a lot of reservations having read very mixed reviews about this hotel from reviews. However given that I could only access THE infinity pool as a guest which they actually did enforced very strictly, I decided that it’d be worth splitting or two nights stay in Singapore between this place and Fullerton Bay Hotel just so that I can experience having been here!   I was so paranoid of not receiving great service that I booked a Club level room for our less than 15-hours total stay at this place and I have to say that I’m relieved(!) to have enjoyed every minute of our stay here! The parking drive-in and the lobby was indeed hectic but not overwhelmingly crowded and it did help that we were served at a separate counter. The staff was…",4,
"Dominating the Singapore skyline the Marina Bay Sands is a world class destination with many treasures to discover. Above this, however is the quality of the staff. These great emissaries of Singaporean hospitality are attentive, smiling and courteous. High marks goes to the HR department for this consistency. Clear worth the trip!",5,
Marina bay is unique in many ways. Previously I have struggled to enjoy this place as it is like a giant bus port and the room finishings were cheap. However I am please to report that they have lifted there game and the room we had was sensational.   There are very few venues in the world that can handle conferences of 2000 people and do it well. MBS is one of them and is world class. Well done on picking up your standards MBS. 10/10,5,
"Stayed here overnight post cruise, had high expectation initially but left with ok feelings. The room size was ok, was on the 2nd floor facing a busy road so no view to speak of; everything clean and worked. The pool on top of the hotel was a tourist area by itself but it's so packed that you can't find a place to sit. The bar next to the pool Ce La Vie offers good view of the city and worth having a drink there.There is also an observatory deck 1 floor below the pool has panoramic view. The hotel is within walking distance to Garden by the Bay and Super Groove. For S$400 a night for a 2nd floor room with no view, I find this pricey.  If I had known beforehand, I would have paid S$100 more and stay at the Ritz.",3,
"It was our first time going to Marina bay sands and we didn't know how to go around that much. However the staff made it very easy for us to be ""AT HOME"" making our stay very pleasant. The Sky deck infinity pool staff was noteably above the standards when it comes to hospitality and courteousness. There are two names I wont forget in  that particular place. The attitude the staff would surely make guests want to come back more. For me besides the glamorous facades of the Marina Bay Sands, it's the nice staff that makes the whole place, even more special! Special mention to the two guys who assisted us today, Dennis and James! Good job guys! Im sure Marina Bay Sands management  is so proud of you! Keep up the good work and THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!",5,
"Extremely impressive building, the façade is visible from the entire center of Singapore. The hotel is huge, there is a shopping mall and a casino. In the evening there is a very interesting light show - Spectra.",4,
"You can’t stay anywhere else when visiting Singapore. It is pricy but it worth at least one nigh so you can spend time at the pool. Some rooms are by the Gardens by the Bay and the view is spectacular! Besides the whole complex with shopping mall, fancy restaurants and the casino is a plus.",5,
"Well there are so many things to do or to see in and around the hotel you need several days to do all the stuff. It's nearly a must do because of the pool but the rest of the hotel itself like the rooms and the service isn't that special. If you have time try to watch the light show.  A good place is over the bay next to the lion fountain. One funny thing was the rooftop bar where you could watch how some ""rich kids"" spend their parent's money. ",4,
The is an excellent hotel with great restaurants & right next to a mega designer shopping mall. The place to visit & stay plus the view from the infinity pool & bar is amazing. It has good links to all the major sites.,5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful wonder in itself. From top floor deck, restaurant, casino, hotel, night club and the famous Infinity Pool. It has everything in it. You'll take two days to explore it. Hotel is awesome to stay. Only inhouse guests can use the infinity pool. Top deck visit requires a fee ticket. You get amazing view of the city. ",5,
"Visually stunning hotel, rooms were immaculate but the check in is shocking a long wait to see the check in staff. You cannot move for people as the hotel is a tourist attraction in its own right and the rooftop pool was packed with people dunking and taking selfies, absolutely no where in this hotel to relax, you evenhad to wait for a table in the club lounge. Expensive and definitely not worth it, I would stay elsewhere and visit with the rest of the hordes for a drink.",2,
"We stayed here for one night while in the city for my boyfriends birthday. There simply aren’t enough words to describe how incredible this place really is.  From start to finish the service is just next level truly one of the best days of our lives.   We booked a grand club king room, checking in via a gorgeous waiting room we were told they upgraded us to a suite as it was his birthday!  The room was out of this world - views over the gardens by the bay, a pool table, living room, kitchen, 2 bathrooms! The most amazing room I’ve ever seen it was gorgeous. Butler service was included and they brought anything you needed anytime. Room service was very good value and offered a wide variety of foods.  Included with our room we got to have afternoon tea 2-4 and canapés & cocktails…",5,
The rooms are big and clean. The toilets are big too. It's better to get a city view room as it offers a prettier view but also more expensive. It is noisy at the lobby and also at the swimming pool area. There are a lot of people at the infinity pool. It's hard to swim there as you will keep banging into people while swimming.,3,
"We stayed at this hotel in January, 2018  This is a must visit hotel when you are in Singapore..loved the experience at the infinity pool  Rooms have an amazing view, a lot to explore in and around the hotel..",4,
"Wonderful, one of the best experiences in a huge Hotel Complex. I am always in awe of Singapore every time I visit...one of the best holiday destinations in the world. The Marina Bay Sands is an extraordinary hotel over 55 stories, and the Infinity pool, bars and restaurants at the top are like stepping into another world...the views of Singapore from these heights are breathtaking! A massive shopping center and Casino ( although I am not a Casino fan) give another world feel to the Marina Bay Sands. With a capacity for 2500 guests you do feel like you are staying in a small boutique hotel as the staff are so courteous, friendly and attentive. Security is high, but not visible-you feel it more than  see it, so one does feel safe and secure. I just really enjoyed Adrift-the…",5,
"I had a wonderful stay here with my friends. Dennis- the skylark attendant made sure I had everything I needed and then some. He recommended the Hello Kitty drink, and I’m still wanting one a year later. I look forward to returning to this hotel in the near future. ",5,
"Always comes here because my friend always got a promotion from marina bay sands as he is a membership from the casino, so it was free!  And everything so comfy, yet clean, and so many features.. u can go to the top for swimming and enjoy the city view, with many skycrapper with all their lights.. so wonderful  The bed itself so comfy, and the wifi connected very fast  Too bad the promotion didnt include the breakfast so couldnt review the breakfast  And if u r crazy grambler, u can play casino and hopefully u get money. Hahaha",5,
"This hotel was one of the main reasons I wanted to visit Singapore. We were flying to Singapore on our way to Bali for our honeymoon and I almost immediately booked the Marina Bay.   We arrived a little early in the day and our room was not ready yet, but they gave us keys and access to the pool level. Since that is what I really wanted anyway we made our way up with haste. Their is a restaurant and a club on the top, but only hotel guests have access to the pool itself. The view is incredible as you can see from any picture, but it was even better at night!  We did not even venture to our room until later that evening, but once there we found quite a large space. It was probably twice as big as a typical hotel room with floor to ceiling windows looking out over the city (47th…",5,
"Visited with a friend and we had a bottle of champagne at CE LA VI Lounge. Best spot to enjoy the view and a bit quieter than Sky View. Perhaps service could improve a bit but apart from it, we enjoyed our visit. ",5,
I love the infinity pool! So relaxing up there! The jacuzzi was awesome too! Staff was amazing and friendly. I'll come back again here! So many things to do just around this hotel. I just love the pool!!!,5,
"The view from our balcony of our room was phenomenal - we overviewed the Gardens by the Sea and spent hours watching the ships come and go - amazing! We also liked the famous view of Singapore, too, of course, but this was truly special.  Our room was pretty big, furniture just alright, but the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom captivated us due to its bathtub and the seperate shower (way too big actually) and lavatory.   The Infinity Pool is worth a visit as this is unique and phenomenal just to watch. we were not really impressed by the experience in the pool itself as it was rather cold and pretty crowded at times (mostly children playing or someone taking selfies) so swimming is hardly possible. Unfortunately the hot tubs were occupied all the time as well, so if you…",5,
Marina Bay Sands is definitely a fab hotel. We stayed there for over a week for our honeymoon. The swimming pool is a must visit. The hotel is beautiful but very busy and crowded. The staff is professional and very friendly. Would definitely recommend !,5,
"The hotel has everything -- pool, room, cleanliness, friendliness, services, and great view is a plus. It is an expensive hotel yet a unique hotel in the world. Enjoy your time without any regret to spend your time.",5,
"Great when traveling with a baby. Check in was a little on the slow side. Early check in was given as we had a baby with us. Lovely good size room with friendly staff. Pool is to cold for baby’s/children under 1 I would say. Great location, 5 mins the gardens at the bay. Big air conditioned Mall below which is great from 12-5pm when it’s to hot for babies to be sightseeing. The Rise restaurant gave us boiling water for the baby’s formula.   Had breakfast at both Rise and Sprago. Rise has a larger selection, personally I preferred Rise’s service and food choices.  Dinner at Lavo was disappointing, 500Sgd for 3 people the price definitely didn’t reflect the food. Jumbo Seafood Riverpoint (10mins by Taxi) highly recommended best meal had in singapore.  Check out was extended by a a…",5,
"Plus: great roof pool, nice rooms, very clean, friendly service, a smile everywhere, great location with gorgeous views to the harbor and open sea, great variety of restaurants  Small minus: very long ways between everything (comfortable shoes needed) and slow elevators ",5,
"This hotel is honestly a little plain inside, at least in our room and the second tower hallways on the floors we could see. I was expecting to feel like I was in Asia, but it was more like maybe Palm Springs, California. The service was nice enough to check us in early and was kind enough to print our boarding passes when we checked out, but seemed very unwilling to help or pay attention to our request for early turndown service during our stay. The beds were comfortable, however, and our Garden View room with self-opening curtains that looked over the Supertrees was very nice. It was complicated to get anywhere with their elevator system, and the pool was a bit of a zoo situation. It’s very highly monitored for people going in and out, but people would put towels on the best…",3,
This is a huge property with a giant mall attached and a casino SO don’t expect tranquility and calm if you book your stay here. The hotel is modern (even though it’s been here quite some time) and is an architectural monument noticeable from almost anywhere in Singapore.  It is right next to Gardena by the Bay which is a cant miss site to see in Singapore.  The pool and top floor bar affords for views for miles of all of the city.  It’s convenient to metro and offers tons of dining options.  The service is good but can be slow because of the large number of guests staying here. It’s a landmark property and great energy but not a place to come to relax.  So get on those walking shoes an go explore!,4,
"Marina Bay Sands is an airport of a hotel with over 2500 rooms and therefore quite impersonal approach, however again it's a must-do for anyone travelling to Singapore. Staying in a Grand King View room, we enjoyed the City view from our bedroom, and views onto the Gardens by the Bay from the bathroom. Main takeaways:   - It's worth paying a bit extra for the Grand King View room as you get the view on both sides of the Bay   - The hotel pool is porbably the most photographed pool in the world, however it's hard not to take a few pictures yourself   - Location is good for the Gardens by the Bay, but you'll end up using cabs for restaurants and bars   - The swimming pool is unfortunately quite cold!",5,
"I had the pleasure of staying at the MBS 2 weeks ago. Yes, it’s expensive but I was also there during the lunar year so I think the rates were higher. I came for the pool.and it delivered. I did not have a problem finding a chair. Towels were plentiful. Breakfast at sunrise at Spago’s was very nice.they keep the kids out of the adult side and the view was spectacular! I think check in is at 11a or 12n but my room was ready when I arrived at 7am, I was very grateful after a 21 hr journey from NY. I had a premium room on the 40th floor, front and center of the super tree garden.i visited the art museum. I hate malls but I went in twice. I had a facial, went to ippudo and toast box. Loved toast box!  That mall is huge and exhausting tho but if you like malls, it’s top notch! This…",5,
"You already know that you're going here, nothing could possibly compare unless you are watching the wallet - even then it's worth a stretch!  There's lots of reviews for MBS, with 2500+ rooms and 10,000+ staff (I asked). It is truly onto itself and the Singapore skyline - so I'll skip a core review of the place and after two visits give you my top tips to help make it a great experience and share what we thought wasn't so great (although very minor). During our first visit we stayed in a Club King (December) and second time in a Marina Suite (January) I like staying in nice places but like I my money to go as far as it can, so hopefully you find this helpful!   1. Book a club level room or higher to get access to the excellent lounge -> If you want to try a value for money…",5,
"We had flown from Paris overnight and thought we would treat ourselves to a day in the famed Marina Bay Sands. Check in was awesome, despite not being entitled to a room until check-in of 3:00 PM, we got a slightly lower height room at 9:00 AM which was fantastic.  Despite the jet lag we took full advantage all of the facilities, including the complimentary drinks and the amazing waveless pool.  We stayed up to watch the light and laser show and then retired for the evening.  In the wee hours of the morning we were awakened by loud thumping on our door.  My son was too scared to answer the door and the knocker went away.  But they returned about five minutes later to do it again.  This time my son looked through the peephole and saw a Marina Bays Sands maintenance man talking on…",2,
"I was really looking forward to our stay @ MBS after reading so much about it and watching the best luxury hotels in the world  Imagine the biggest shopping mall in the world with 3 hotel blocks inside it- 2651 bedrooms and well obviously that caters for 5000 + guests and you definitely know that!  Check in was slow even though we had preregistered - bedroom was nice we had a club room on 47th floor nice views , bed was basic and I felt the linen pillows and quilts were old and needed replaced.  Level 55 for 5-7pm drinks and nibbles was nice but again total chaos  Breakfast again was chaos just far too many people wandering about  Had lunch @ cest la vie restaurant- food was ok but service was appalling- kept having to ask for things and maybe a smile would have been good!!  Now…",2,
"Stayed here for my son's 3rd birthday, got a room with the fantastic view of the marina. It was just the best. In-Room dining was less to be desired, but service and the facilities were great and of course they've got the best people around. We got served ice-cream while in line for check-in because it was summer, the kids loved it, and the infinity pool, wow! Can't wait to be back to MBS",5,
"Just Fantastic! I always believe that people ‘make’ an experience and the staff in Renko were excellent. From greeting, to preparing tea, to serving the food, all were friendly, helpful and polite.  The food was fabulous. Although feeling guilty at saying ‘yes please’ when offered more, the superb tastes made it difficult not to do so.  Presentation was second to none! Renko itself is positioned on the ground floor, which initially leads you to be slightly disappointed that it is not on the 57th. But this experience is not about the views, it is about all of the above and the location and ambiance of Renko certainly does not disappoint.   PS. If you want the views, do afternoon on a Tuesday (only) and then move up to Spago for half price cocktails.",5,
"If you are staying in Singapore and can stretch to the Marina Bay Sands you will notice it is so much different to  most other hotels, if you go stay club class, the food, drink and champagne really does flow, the meals make it cheaper than most other hotels in its class also, it saves you a small fortune and you get 1st class service,  the staff are absolutely amazing, nothing too much trouble and extremely attentive without being overboard, they have got this place really sorted. We are definitely working towards coming back and staying here for sure. My sincere thanks to all of the staff in the restaurant and right through the hotel.",5,
"My wife booked a surprise stay for us at MBS on my birthday! Staying here was high on our wishlist in Singapore.  Hotel lobby is huge and you see both tourists and guests. I don’t mind it as I too have walked through it multiple times.   Our room was on the 26th floor, facing the city. The views were fantastic and they held my attention at different times of day - seeing the marina with its backdrop of CBD and Raffles place. The room amenities were at par with any standard 5-star hotel.   The infinity pool is the star attraction. The unobstructed views from there are unmatched! Being locals, we could identify buildings and landmarks at far distances too. Again the scenery is quite different during the day and after sunset. The poolside service from Spago is great as well. should…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is the main icon of Singapore. The hotel is amazing, the swimming pool on the 57th is part of the landscape of the city. The service is impeccable. This is a ""must-stay"" hotel in Singapore.",5,
"Had a stopover in Singapore on the way to the Maldives and you can’t go to Singapore and not stay here right?? All the pics you’ve seen online of the rooftop pool are accurate. The view from up there is unreal. It’s so awesome night or day. Our room had  an amazing view of the skyline also. Room was huge, shower was great. Bed was extremely comfortable. Large casino and shops as well. Food was great. We would definitely stay again! It was awesome!!",5,
"I stayed for only one night at this wonderful location, just for visit and enjoy the Infinity Pool, it was an stunning experience,  I'll never forget! I've enjoyed everything up there, I strongly recommend this unique experience to everyone!",5,
This hotel firstly should lose it's 5 stars because it is far from it. It is more like 3 stars at best. Stayed here and the only good thing about this is the floor to ceiling window and also the infinity Pools at the top otherwise you should stay elsewhere. Over hyped and over priced.,3,
"Stayed in this hotel with family. It was expensive everything but the place is so fascinating. Everywhere you look is picture worthy. In room food is also expensive but there are a lot of cheaper choices nearby. Accessible to many tourist attractions on walking distance. Infinity pool was great both for adults and kids. Rooms are clean, organized, elegant and spacious. I expected nothing less for the price and they exceeded it.",5,
"Stayed here for two nights for a birthday trip to Singapore.   On the exterior the hotel looks impressive but the hotel was busy when we arrived. The checkin staff were rude and dismissive (you can blame it on it being busy, but that is no way to treat a customer spending £300 per night on a hotel room). The hallways, lifts and amenities of the hotel were as to be expected - posh and modern. The rooms were the size of shoeboxes with very little walking space. The view was overlooking the Sky Gardens which are very pretty at night time. The hotel infinity pool was, in my honest opinion, a let down. Busy, crowded and we generally didn't want to stay any longer than we did. Didn't have the breakfast so can't comment. Check out was a shambles (again very busy) and staff were as rude…",2,
"Let us get a few things out of the way first. If you want an unmatched view of Singapore Marina, from a swimming pool, then this is the place to be. However, if you are after attentive service, a quiet special stay, this is not the hotel you are looking for. I would go so far to say that if it were not for the swimming pool, a holiday inn offers better service. I will explain in detail: the check in process: I had booked 3 rooms and had a party of 8 so expected it to take a while, but not as much as an hour. In the meantime, the rest of the family had nowhere decent to sit, no welcome drink, just an uncomfortable “art piece” to sit on. The rooms: no bathtub...for a 5 star place, not good enough. The pool or gym or observation deck: fabulous if you can get through the maze of…",1,
For those unfamiliar with it Marmite is a peculiar brown sticky British yeasty spread that divides opinion on first taste!  So too The Marina Sands!  It is without doubt an architectural wonder and the views from our room were without parallel and the staff all worked exceptionally hard to cope with the daily innundation of guests.  Now the downsides - suffering from it's iconic status many areas of the hotel are swamped with guests - a 20 minute queue to access the Club Lounge on level 55 only to witness locust like behaviour of other guests stuff handbags with food from the buffet table - perhaps parma ham is a rare delicacy in your home country - I hope you enjoyed it !  Constant noise especially in the lifts and at the poolside made for a less than relaxing stay coupled with…,3,
"Only had a short, 2 night stay at Marina Bay Sands but it was just what we needed to start our trip. The room was one of the largest I have stayed in with an amazing view (we asked for a high floor) of the city. We could even see the fountain show although it’s better experienced from the ground. Breakfast was buffet style with 3 dining options. We went for Bliss on both mornings as there was no queue. Spago on the roof seemed a bit disorganised and had a long wait so we gave it a miss.   The hotel was huge - it reminded us of a Vegas hotel - and clean. Lots of places to eat, drink and shop. The main draw is of course the pool on the top floor. This was amazing and didn’t disappoint. We easily got a sunbed on both days. It was nice that there was an adult only side to the pool -…",5,
"Such a fabulous experience staying at this hotel from start to finish. The rooms are boasting with space, gorgeous bathroom and amazing views from the balcony. The famous infinity pool is even better when witnessed in real life, particularly at night. All the staff are so friendly and professional too. Will definitely be back in the future. ",5,
"Picture do not do this Hotel justice, it is amazing to see. It does not come cheap, but if you can afford it do it. Rooms are great and staff very helpful. Lots of good places to eat at all prices. Casino is free to guests and there does not seem to be any dress code. It is a large hotel with loads of shops, did not get to use most of facilities as only stopped two nights. ",5,
"Marina Bay Sands has been quite an experience for my family! Going there for Singapores National Day to see miraculous fireworks, we went to the crowded swimming pool to view it. The hotel was sweet! One of the best designed hotels I have ever been to. The hotel was clean and the staff there were very helpful! It was not my familys’ first time and it would not be the last. And adding on, the food was spectacular and the view was stunning.",5,
"We finished up a trip to Thailand with 2 days in Singapore and decided to stay at marina bay sands for a night. Best decision of the whole trip! Yes it’s expensive- especially on a Saturday night- but it was worth the experience. The pool is as great as we expected, but definitely was cold. They need to warm it up a little! The service was fantastic- check in was quick, Bell hops and room service were wonderful, and the restaurants were pricey but good. We didn’t pay for the breakfast included in the rate because we’ve read so much about how crowded the restaurants are at breakfast. We went across the street to the shoppes to a restaurant called the bird and it was literally the best brunch I’ve ever had! Marina bay sands helped make Singapore the highlight of our 10 day trip to…",5,
"Really nice choice, with good shops around as well as other activities, the mall etc. where you can go out till late. Singapore is really lovely and so is this amazing hotel. I would recommend you try it.",5,
The room was really nice.  The view of the gardens from our balcony was amazing. Swimming in the pool was a great experience.   We had an amazing stay there but unfortunately  we are stilling waiting on our $400 deposit that was taken from our credit card on check in.  We have rung and sent numerous emails to be told to we have to check with our bank. Getting frustrated with the delay. It has been one month now.,1,
"Had a skyview king deluxe on floor 47. Amazing views and a gorgeous room.  Swimming pool really is stunning, if a little busy.  The attached mall is stuffed with high end shops and has a nightly fountain show outside which is not to be missed!  We went over to Chinatown for much cheaper food and drink after we’d experienced the marina bay sands offerings.  MRT station direct to hotel/ mall making it really easy to get around. ",5,
"The MBS (as most people call it) is the most emblematic symbol of Singapore and coming here without paying a visit is missing an important part of Singapore, although is not the definition of its culture.  By the way, I did not stay at the hotel... if you are looking for the hotel review, move on as I went there to take a look at the building, the infinity pool and some of the restaurants/bars it has to offer.  Getting to the hotel can be very easy as cabs are abundant and all of them know where the building is... Now, if you want to get there walking the story might be a little bit different as the lines can cross between each other. We got off (the first time) on the train station with the same name (Marina Bay) which is located south-west of where you should be, from there…",4,
"I think MBS is one of those hotels you have to stay in at least once in your lifetime (or more if you can afford it, why not?) The other half is a frequent guest of this iconic building and always enjoys a drink or two while admiring the Singapore skyline from the rooftop bar.  Of course swimming in the infinity pool is the highlight of my stay here. Although the pool can get quite crowded that didn't really bother me but the amount of selfie sticks can actually ruin your experience. The service is top class and our room was fabulous. MBS is also used for corporate functions, shopping and tourism so as expected the common areas could get really busy.",5,
"We had a wonderful stay at the Marina Bay Sands. From beginning to end we felt very well taken care of. The staff is very well trained and the public spaces are very well kept. The rooftop pool and restaurants are one of a kind. Our kids were just stunned! Rooms and bathrooms are spacious, we slept very well. We will definitely be back! Special thanks to Wangelin Sum for being so attentive! ",5,
I've been to Marina Bay Sands twice. The hotel is the most amazing one I have stayed in my life. The infinite swimming pool on the top of the building is fantastic. The King-bed room is spacious and luxious. The scenery from room window is amazing. Manager Wangelin Sum is very hospitable and friendly. Breakfast has various varieties with high quality and service.The biggest shopping mall and Casino are just around the hotel. You can feel everything during the stay.,5,
I was given a privilege to be one of the Philippine Delegates for Nissan Futures Event last Feb 5-7 and stayed on this Hotel. I’m expecting a lot on it as the Hotel looks like extravagant outside and more of an icon in Singapore. Inside the lobby is a mere mall like scenery with a lot of people in and out of the area.Rooms are just so so as compared to other hotels i’ve stayed with as with their beds and its comfort rooms. Their toiletries are also not that extravagant or signature type as compared to others as i expect that their room rates are far more expensive. The infinity pool is great but i felt like you wont stay long as what you intend to be as air up there is too cold to swim but restaurants on both side of the area is nice area to stay with and see the sun set.…,3,
"I was thinking this place could be overrated before, but When I got the chance to spend two nights here, I absolutely love it. I have an amazing view from my room, the food here just amazing, there is club and restaurants that you could try. One of them offer the iconic infinity pool and singapore view, also you can walk around the shopping center or spend some money in casino area. All in one package, not only offer you a nice place to stay but also give you options to get well dining and luxury shopping experience ❤️",4,
"This was my second trip to the Marina Bay Sands and it was just as amazing as the first, I went to Imperial Treasure Restaurant which was a amazing meal, we had the whole duck and it was simply superb.  The service in the restaurant was amazing then decided to have a little punt on the roulette and won 1300 Singapore off 50 dollars which was a great bonus.  Then we had a drink in the bar.  I wish i could go more in depth but this trip was a while ago.",5,
"We have been staying at this hotel for the 3rd time now and it still has its magic! The check in was very fast and we had a city view room. It offers a breathtaking view of the skyline and the nightly laser show. The room in the 43 floor was very clean and with two king size beds large enough for 3 persons. All the hotel staff, from the receptionist, concierge, pool supervisors to the room maids and the managers were all highly professional and super friendly. Once we had needed additional bathroom utensils and we then received them in record speed. The infinity pool on the roof top of the hotel is for sure the most impressive one that I have seen. Really a place to be, especially at night time! It seemed to me that there were significantly more people in the pool (any day and…",5,
"It’s big and impersonal (it reminds me of Vegas hotels and sometimes you feel like youre staying in a shopping centre) but there is no denying that this is such a unique and iconic hotel.   To be honest staying here for the pool alone is worth it. Such a great experience. Whilst it does get busy, there are plenty of places to relax up in the sky, with various lounging areas and hot tubs. The views... wow.  We were upgraded on arrival. Huge room with floor to ceiling windows giving us an unbeatable view of Singapore. For what we paid (the hotel have low season rates of like £150!) it’s exceptional value for money.   Only ate in the Rise restaurant but this was excellent quality and not super expensive ( I would recommend signing up for marina rewards- it’s free and you get a big…",5,
"During our stay in Singapore, we have decided to spend one night @ Marina Bay Sands. Unforgettable experience, friendly stuff, amazing room and a dream of swimming pool.  Check-in goes really fast and for check-out, they have a quite interesting system (either filling out a paper and dropping it with the keys in a post either video check-out directly from the room)  Highly recommended ",5,
"Having arrived at this monster of a hotel with 2000+ rooms this place is overwhelming in every sense. First of there are 3 towers so be sure to know which tower you are booked into prior to arriving to instruct your transfer driver, this will ensure you check in at the right place. We had booked an Orchid Suite and we were located in Tower 3 on the 53rd floor. Great view however if you are in a club room or suite, try and secure Tower 2 due to Club 55 and the gym being in Tower 2. Club 55 is the exec lounge which offers the normal 3 times a day additions, breakfast, lunch and evening drinks with canapés. But be advised though this is a busy hotel EVERYWHERE so even the exec lounge gets full, so much so, we left it as there were no seats ! Mainly staff were polite, it’s…",2,
"My stay here was incredible,you get exactly what you pay for. We were able to check in 5 hours before check in time. If you are debating whether to get the garden or city view go with the Garden. The pool is fun at night and the view is stunning. Don't eat at the food court in the connecting mall, be sure to visit the art museum and enjoy the show by the water at 9:45 pm.",5,
"The hotel is a Singapore landmark of course. I have been to the rooftop bar twice before but never to the pool. It is only for registered hotel guests. So I booked one night with a friend to share the extremely expensive room fee. Checking in we were in a long queue. I was quite surprised about the extra tax fee, which we had to pay beside the 400 plus dollars already invested in the one night adventure. Unfortunely we were given a room on the 6th floor, not high at all. Very disappointing. The hotel is quite loud and through our door we could hear a lot of noice and music at night from inside the atrium. We had a premier room and enjoyed the big nice bathub. The safe was broken and fell apart when touching it. Also, the minibar cannot be used as a personal fridge. If you touch…",4,
Tour is incomplete if you haven't seen the light show..which is daily for tourist for 8-10min.for free! They have exact time to start and finish. Every Wednesday there is free entry for women if you want to go on top and see the view of full Singapore and it is awesome.So plan your internet as per days and enjoy the view.. breathtaking..without doubts.,5,
"We came here with 4 families. 18 people in total. We stayed 5 nights at Marina Bay Sands and partied for NYE. We loved everything. The rooms, the view, the gym, the open space of the hotel, the breakfast, specially the breakfast, the design, the plants, the staff. It was one of our best holidays. An extraordinary place.",5,
"Everyone knows about this hotel so I won't bother writing too much. Breakfast was amazing, views were even better and the staff in the bar near the infinity pool couldn't have been any nicer. Honeymooners won't get upgrades but you don't really need one here.",5,
"The MBS was a very nice hotel And we had a very comfortable stay with excellent amenities. The staff are friendly and we were fortunate to get a room upgrade. The views are spectacular and we had views of both sides.   The infinity pool was very nice on the 57th floor. Gets a bit crowded and a little annoying with people and their selfie sticks. The food was overpriced for what they offer. Paid $50 for two sandwiches which I didn’t think was anything special.   I registered with their loyalty program but found the male staff a little curt.    Overall the hotel is excellent, great decor and nice spacious rooms.  ",4,
We stayed here for 4 nights in early Feb and really enjoyed it.  This hotel is simply a destination in its own right.  From the iconic infinity pool on the 57th floor sky deck to the huge range of restaurants catering to every taste - this place has it all.  Our Premier King Room was large and very well appointed but it was the stunning views across Marina Bay that lifted this room above the ordinary.  We enjoyed a fantastic dinner on our last night at Ce La Vi up on the sky deck and were seated at an awesome table with great views - and I won't forget the Patron cocktails at Spago (again up on the sky deck).  It's been mentioned in other reviews that check-in can be a problem at MBS but we had a very good check-in experience.  Normal check-in time is 3pm but we arrived in…,5,
"We happened to book our trip to Singapore over Chinese New Year.  Whoops!  That made an already expensive hotel even more expensive but I must say it was worth it and I am so glad that I stayed at this hotel at least once in my life.  Don't be cheap if you are traveling from a distant place - stay here at least one night, but preferably two.    Check-in at the Marina Bay Sands was slightly annoying. It's a huge resort casino so I didn't expect it to be easy but they need to fix their IT systems.  They direct you by default to Tower 1 to check-in with their ""reminder"" e-mail but I should have followed my reservation confirmation and checked in at Tower 3 as that instructed.  We were able to check-in at Tower 1 area but had to walk across the hotel to the Tower 3 elevators.  Not a…",5,
"Rooms, restaurants and unique appeal are all great but the staff and even better. Checking in was a slow drag and needs to be improved but bear with it for the experience. The 'surf board' stuck on top of the towers with its infinity pool is a must experience for Singapore.  Ok, it's not cheap but it gives a hell of a memory!",4,
"We stayed there for 2 nights, check-in is quite late with 3pm, however our room was already available at 11am.  Where to start... - Foyer - really big and impressive, but full of tourists (also people who're not staying in the hotel) - Room: we had a great room in one of the upper stories ++ - Infinity pool: Nothing can compare this masterpiece ++ (small minus: water is cold, a lot of wind & you need to be early to get a cot - Restaurants: Are good, top standards but very expensive, we would recommend to eat in the several shopping centres - Personal: Professional, kind, no complaints - Casino: No fee if you have a room in the hotel, would highly recommend a view into the biggest Casino of the world.  Resume: For me this hotel was on my bucket list, it was worth a visit! Would I…",4,
"As the infinity pool is for hotel guests only, staying at least 1 night is almost a must. But there are also other benefits that justify the room price like the free snacks and drinks in the afternoon and the delicious breakfast. And of course: the room (we were in a suite) is very clean and spacious.",5,
"Infinity pool offered brilliant views of the city, especially at night. However the pool was very cold. Drinks and food very expensive. There is an adults only area in the swimming pool area, but there were Chinese kids on several occasions in there (obviously the rule does not apply to them!). Staff were friendly and polite. We were able to check in early for no extra cost which was very handy.",4,
"We absolutely loved our stay! We were lucky to be able to check in a bit earlier than the said time. The room is magnificent but the pool is just breathtaking. I recommend getting up there at 6AM to beat the crowds. The food in the pool bar is great - I recommend ceasar salad, fries, and especially pina colada! I recommend choosing the right pool as it is adults only and all children are kindly escorted out of the section. Consequently there is less crowd in this part of the pool. There are also jacuzzis at the opposite side of the hotel but we didn´t manage to get in unfortunately. We were able to store our luggage after check out which was very convenient. Looking forward to staying here again!",5,
I traveled all over the world (all continents except Arctic) but Singapore is for me the best city I have ever visited. Even it is situated in the heart of Asia it is very clean and tidy and people who are living there are very warm and welcoming. In Marina bay hotel I spent only two nights but it was enough to enjoy viewing the beautiful panorama of the town from the largest pool in the world on that hight.,5,
This hotel was very impressive and well run and of course the rooftop pool is amazing and a must-see if you happen to be in Singapore. The service from the staff was really excellent and I wouldn't fault them. For me it was all a little bit too faceless and impersonal and just too big but I would recommend a one night stay for the pool access.,4,
a nice view to hangout.. very good environment.. a lot of place to have a shopping.. a good place to have a nice food and drinks..a place to go through to the bridge and to gardens by the bay..a veey beutiful scenery u cnt miss out this..,5,
"My stay here was filled with excitement, fun and aww moments.. the room had a fantastic view.. the hotel itself is a tourist spot and if you staying here you dont need to go anywhere to have fun.. this place has all within the boundaries or just at walking distance.. infinity pool was the cherry on the top.. picture perfect moments! Loved my stay..",5,
"We stayed for 2 nights in February en route to the Maldives. We arrived very early in the morning and the hotel staff were kindly able to check us in early which was very much appreciated. Our 44th floor city view room was enormous and very smart with an incredible view of the skyline. However, the absolute winner was the extraordinary rooftop pool which is an experience in itself. Service throughout was spot on from all staff. We had breakfast by the pool and whilst there was a short wait to be seated (understandably) again food and service was excellent. My only suggestion is to be aware that as the pool is 57 floors up, it can get a rather windy and a little chilly when the sun is behind the clouds. Also the pool area can be rather busy at times. Overall, well worth a visit.",5,
"The Pool is the only plus point in this hotel. The service is average, rooms are good but they don't even have a proper coffee machine inside the room, Fridge is full of their stuff and charges are out of this world. I had to order another extra fridge at a cost to even cool the water provided ... What the heck is this?  There is no human interaction other than at the pool area.. lobby is full of passing by people... nothing more to shout about other than the pool with a view.  Worth  to stay for a night to use the pool ....otherwise look for elsewhere.",3,
"I was so looking forward to stay in this hotel. Not sure, maybe it was the time of the year, feels like everyone decided to check in that day. It was so crowded.  Granted their highlights being the infinity pool and the sky view deck. I was expecting a large pool but 2 small pools. one for adults one for families. You cant even enjoy the pool cause its so crowded. You have to squeeze in between couples and families to get near the edge of infinity pool to get a decent picture. Their jacuzzis only 2 and small as well and you have to fight for the spot to squeeze in with a family of 10. Also they should have a policy for hotel guests to not come down on their hotel robes. So unappealing. For the price of the room, totally overprice. Unfortunately did not show in the quality of the…",1,
"Yes, it was worth it. I was fortunate enough to get a high level room that faced Gardens by The Bay looking out to the harbour dotted by container ships (I love ships). The room was very clean, spacious, and had the quality you would expect. The balcony was big and private enough that you can comfortably sit back and relax and enjoy the view day or night. Obviously, I had to check out the rooftop infiniti pool and the view was really spectacular. The pool was surprisingly not busy and I enjoyed several hours sun bathing, swimming, and people watching.",5,
"By far some of the best service we've experienced in a very long time. My partner took me here for my birthday, so I can be a bit much when it comes to the level of service that I expect and they DELIVERED! They upgraded our room, which we loved, there's an endless amount of amenities, food, bars, clubs, and shops.  Our next visit we're just going to stay in the hotel and experience all the other amenities we didn't get a chance to enjoy.  I highly recommend this hotel and resort.",5,
"Let me give you my honest review here, when my girlfriend told me, don’t be shocked at fragrance hotel riverside, because the room very small, bathroom very small, I prepared myself mentally and thought of the worst, when I entered the room I was surprised that is better than what I was expecting. Moving on to Marina Bay Sands, I was expecting too much but I was shocked!!! let’s start with the room we booked deluxe room, when we entered the hallway is big bedroom with big couch the views are awesome, I entered the bathroom and I was shocked that there is no bathtub!!! 5 STAR HOTEL with no bathtub? Ok we called to upgrade for premium after 20 minutes very nice guy came to help shift to premium, we entered the premium room, hallway big, room small with 2 small chairs no couch,…",2,
"Stayed in this hotel for two nights around Christmas. We had booked two club rooms and glad we did. We had access to the club lounge, infinity pool, viewing gallery on the top floor with separate lounge for check-in and check-out. Considering the hotel is massive the queues are equally massive for normal rooms. I would suggest to pay a bit extra for the club rooms.  The views are amazing from the room. We had our rooms facing Garden by the Bay and it did not disappoint. The facilities in the room were good. One morning we used one of the ground floor restaurants for the breakfast, it was alright. Next morning we went to club lounge for breakfast. It was much quieter here. The infinity pool is amazing. It is an experience on its own. The views of the city are great.   If I ever…",5,
"We stayed in the Marina Bay Sands and honestly I had no idea what to expect. Of course you knew about the infinity pool and the view from it BUT everything else is also amazing. When we entered in the room (which had a garden view - to Gardens by the Bay) we were flashed. As soon as you put the hotel card in the slot, curtains opening automatically. Such a lovely and extremely good smelling bathroom - great. The bed was very comfortable and I think I never had a more comfortable one than here. When we then went to the top, where the infinity pool was, we were flashed a second time. It’s amazing up there, unfortunately very crowded. The pool is more a place for poser, not exactly for swimmers. Nice drinks and food at the pool. Next morning when we had breakfast in “The Rise “ it…",5,
"Excellent rooms, good club and excellent staff, very busy hotel, pool area busy in the mornings but overall a good experience, food good, breakfast in the club on 55 very good, staff very attentive. Rooms clean and bigger than average room, close to the gardens and easy to get around direct from the SMRT",5,
"We stayed here because it is well known in Singapore even though it was very expensive.  You pay for the view - we had the lovely view of the garden.  The infinity pool was a sight to not miss...wish they heated the pool up though (we went there in the morning to skip the rush, but the water was so cold since the sun has not yet covered it). Close/connected to the mall, casino, restaurants, and other places to go.  Other than the view and infinity pool, that was it for the hotel.  Was it worth it?  yes.  Would I go back?  probably not going to spend more again.",4,
"First things first. MBS is a really nice hotel and there is no doubt about that. But seriously, what went wrong? There is a serious constant miscommunication between the staff.  Take my experience for example, one night I was trying to ask for the price of lunch at RISE for the next day and the lady there says ( quote ) "" There will be a 20% for lunch tomorrow, would you like to make a reservation? "". So we made a reservation for the next day but when it comes to payment, there is no discount or whatsoever. Then comes the parking part, which charged us for about $8 although we have had redeemed it through the Lifestyle Card kiosk for $4. But it only cost $4 more so it isnt a big deal. What I am wanting to make a point here is that the staffs here are very eager to help us and…",3,
"We spent our last night here after two at the Pan Pacific, at both hotels we booked Club Lounge rooms. On arrival we were glad that we had as the normal queue for check-in was extremely long, with Club rooms you check-in in a small lounge situated to the side of the main reception and they use a ticket system to ensure you have a stress free wait. There were complimentary bottles of water and ice creams to enjoy as you waited. Check-in was smooth and we went off to our room. On arrival at our room our luggage was waiting for us, extremely efficient. We changed and went up to the pool which was the primary reason for our stay, the photo opportunity. We managed to get two beds next to the pool but because it was so busy we decided to return in the morning to get our pictures. The…",4,
There is no denying that this is a visual dream and a very instagram worthy pool but scratch away from that and we found the whole experience just very average at best. Upon checking in where there are clearly not enough desks - in tower 3 - we were told that the VIP and Tower 1 check in had more to serve the clearly more important guests!! Not a great way to welcome the bulk of your clientele... it just felt like a human processing factory and people shuffling around in queues with selfie sticks to take the hundreds of endless shots! The pool after 2 and the majority of check ins are completed becomes a human soup - pretty gross! The toilet facilities at the pool were actually not clean and had no attendant for the 2000 people heavily using them - I would have expected some…,3,
"Me and my family has choose to spend our CNY holiday in MBS. However, we have disappointed on their services. We have stayed for 3 days 2 nights, a room charged about SGD 700+ for this 5 star hotel. But the experience for me which is worse than a 3 star hotel. This is a very unpleasant and all the issue should not be happened in a 5 star hotel. I’m very disappointed on this hotel. Overall, on MBS, the only unique thing is the infinity pool, other than that, it is just nothing. Overrated hotel, and worst customer service. Not friendly, even for their housekeeping staff is not smiling to their guest. I will not recommend anyone of you to stay in this hotel. Very strongly, Please do not stay on this hotel. If you have this budget, you may stay in St. Regis which located nearby…",1,
"The best hotel in Singapore great entertainment place with a lot of activities, top of the hotel is stunning with a swimming pool and great view overlooking Singapore. A lot of Shops and Restaurants and bars and coffee shops available also in the nearby areas. Good location. Prices expensive to very expensive, but to visit it for one time experience it is worthed!!!",4,
"This cant get better. Great view, great room, great service and great food. Many things to do. Bars, restaurants and mall, all are there. Great service, we got to check in early and checked out late. Our rom had great view.",5,
"All said before, I only have positive comments for this hotel, it’s an amazing piece of architecture. Staff very helpful, up graded the room so I could check in really early, it was worth it, views are amazing of gardens by the bay, I think this is the best side to look out at. The pool gets busy in the afternoon but both times around 12.00 when I went there was plenty of space and beds. It is a bit expensive but as a once in a lifetime experience well worth the expense. We only live once. ",5,
"If it’s on your bucket list do it  Impressive building from every angle inside & out but more like a town so lacks that warm personal feel.  Despite the worst possible checkin after a14 hour flight & shattering that special feel( we were checked in then advised booking was for the following day) was a great stay.  Sky view room was good size , large comfortable bed, huge amounts of storage, safe, iron, hairdryer, mini bar, ironing board, great huge fluffy white towels, robe & slippers  Curtains opened when you put key in light slide  Shower no bath, tendency to flood floor & steam up bathroom as at floor level with no lip Great toiletries  Fabulous range of food & great breakfast buffet but breakfast from 6-1000 every day  View over CBD was great  Skydeck /pool fabulous  Great…",5,
"Set up as a resort hotel where everybody is encouraged to stay and spend on site or at the adjacent glossy shopping mall and at inflated prices.  Vast majority Chinese clientele (or maybe that was because it was their New Year).  Other reviews have covered many salient issues in detail.  No getting away from the fact that building structure and roof top infinity pool are feats of engineering and I can speak from a professional perspective.  However there are flaws :-   1.	The rooms are comfortable enough but an interior designer’s disaster area.  Mish-mash of different fabrics, stone surfaces and wood veneers.  Badly detailed bathroom, which must be a nightmare to clean.  To cap it all the electronically operated curtains only can be opened HALFWAY and cannot be manually…",2,
"Can't complain here, had a lovely stay-cation with a great view over the gardens by the bay and the room is nicely sized and does everything you need and room service was quick.  Had fun and yes it's expensive but I paid for convenience rather than the name and the pool everyone else paid for!",4,
"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here on our last week of a 5 month Asian trip and what a place to stay!!! The check in was faultless and we loved the mini Cornettos and mango juices we were given by smiling staff. Within 10 minutes of walking through the doors we were arriving in our room. We chose a dulux city view room on the 37th floor and it was beautiful. The views of the city were spectacular, the room was spacious and comfy and the bed was HUGE!!! The pool was fantastic and not overcrowded but what we loved the most were the 3 massive hot tubs! Once we kicked out the children who gate crashed them (they are clearly signed adults only!) We ordered champagne and sipped on bubbles whilst enjoying the views and the wonderful service. We ate a hamburger and also ordered the 4…",5,
The pool here & the architecture of this building are amazing!! Good place to just relax. The food & the service were up to the standard that we expected.We enjoyed our time for a short visit. It is over the top & completely  touristy obviously. We have stayed on the bay side & the gardens side & both rooms had great views.,4,
"Is it a pricey hotel? Yes. Is it worth the money? Yes. From the spacious bedrooms, fab views with floor to ceiling windows (we had a city view room on 46th floor in Tower 1), very comfortable beds, superb (non blowy) air con, lush bathroom - couldn't have asked for a better room in a hotel. Reception were also obliging and gave us a late checkout. The roof top infinity pool and jacuzzis were the icing on the cake. There are 3 swimming pools which span across the top of the 3 hotel tower blocks. Loved it. Plenty of Loungers, towels and staff servicing the area too. Hotel is perfectly located at Gardens by the Bay. Go for a stroll around there - it's lovely.",5,
Stay here for a short business trip. I can say the hotel is awesome. The check in process is a bit slow in my opinion. The room is clean and modern but nothing special. Its facing the city. Didn’t manage to try any restaurants. There are a lot of people in the hotel but I assume nearly half of them are just tourists admiring the the hotel and visiting the sky park.,4,
Our last visit to Singapore was 10 years ago as a part of our honeymoon (pre-children and pre-MBS) and we loved it! So 10 years on we thought it was the perfect time to revisit. We wanted to stay in the Marina Bay area as we stayed at the Pan Pacific last time and the area was perfect!  Initially when we booked my wife wasn't 100% convinced that MBS would live up to the hype or the price tag! However within moments of arriving we knew we had made the correct choice. Despite a boarder line rude lady on reception we didn't let this ruin our first impressions.  The room was compact put perfectly formed and the bathroom and shower was excellent. Our room was on the 37th Floor and overlooked the Gardens by the Bay.   A word of warning if you are travelling with children... the rooms…,5,
"The best hotel nice rooms, perfect view, the infinity pool was great, ,good foods, Many shops, all the shops are very expensive !!at the top of the hotel are bar with good food and music, and the view are marvelous",5,
"Was great, I'm really scared of heights but felt secure. No entertainment up there apart from a very expensive gift kiosk. Huge platform to walk around. Was there on a Thursday and wasn't crowded at all. Don't miss doing this!",4,
"We are a  couple with a 7 year old child who visited Singapore as part of our Bali trip in August 2017. First time round, wanted to experience the futuristic Singapore hence chose to stay at MBS. I loved it - my husband thought it was overpriced. The whole construction as you approach from the highway is impressive. Premices are immaculate, hotel is one of the kind, spotless but the pool is the key attraction. Up on the 57th floor, we stayed until midnight, were given bathrobes and beds, high music, great food, we absolutely loved it!  There is also a light show, a canal and other features which are worth viewing.  Our room was a double deluxe which was huge; resembled a suite, had a living room and enormous bathroom. View was amazing!!!! The whole wall was window framed…",4,
"Experience luxury in a new way. A stay at Marina Sands can be a once in a lifetime ""must"" experience. The hotel is only 8 years old (2018) but feel that is was open ""yesterday"". Several unique facilities like the ""Infinity pool"" which is situated onto of the 57 floor tall hotel.",5,
"This hotel is amazing. Very expensive, but worth trying. The first time we stayed there, they had were represented at Singapore Airport. A bus was available to take you to the hotel, and paperwork was completed on the bus and your luggage collected at the airport. The next time you saw your luggage was in your room. They no longer have that facility. If you are a returning guest don't bother looking for the hotel bus as it's been discontinued.",5,
"I had booked a city view Orchid suite as a surprise for my proposal. It was an extremely memorable experience with MBS.   Check-In: Suite guests have a private area where they are able to check in near the entrance lobby. It is well stocked with water and drinks, even got offered an ice cream. The staff were very diligent in trying to help us arrange a temporary additional card while we coordinated logistics for the surprise. Very smooth an easy.   The Suite: The size and view was a real treat. Definitely opt for the city view as it is not to be missed. The high ceiling definitely add to the regal feel and the furnishings were top notch. We used the concierge service which comes with the suite to get some ice and champagne glasses. I have to say the staff deserve high praise for…",5,
"What an awesome hotel, the size of it is amazing, all staff friendly and runs like clockwork, breakfast was great, lovely and fresh. The pool is amazing with great viewing points, prices for food and drinks are reasonable considering you are at a top hotel. Nighttime view is amazing, it’s selfie city!!!, if you don’t have a selfie stick you will look out of place!!!, lol  Would just like to say some of the customers are so rude and arrogant to staff I don’t know how they stay polite to them..  Hats of to all the staff ",5,
"Not the first time staying in MBS. Was impressed by the efficient of the hskp. Went to the gym at level 55 for an hour and our room was all nicely made up and clean when we stepped in the room. Our shoes and items was scattered around the room but it was placed nicely when we returned. They even have a bed deco on the bed after making up the room. Little actions that counts.(: thank you, Yun Xia, for the service.  ",5,
"The views alone from the rooms and the rooftop make it worth it. Customer service was great and we were able to get our room early. Connected to mall with many eatary options. Connected to Gardens by the Bay and our room had direct view of it. Also included in stay is access to observatory and entry to the rooftop club (not sure if only some nights for club). If you can afford it, then go for it. ",5,
"We stayed in a club level room with our 2 young children which included a king bed, a rollaway bed and the sofa bed made up - but it still felt spacious nonetheless.  The room had a marvellous city view and we could watch the nightly light show from our room. Our booking included breakfast and we chose to eat each morning at the open-air rooftop restaurant Spago - absolutely delicious, fresh and plenty of variety with superb views of the supertrees and ships in the distance. The booking also included afternoon tea and then later, canapés - this was a boon as we filled up so much at canapés with yummy food and French champagne (piper) that we didn’t need dinner.   The pool was very special and was the real reason we chose to stay at MBS.  Sure it got crowded and the selfie-takers…",5,
"Unique hotel with a top level like no other in the world: a swimming pool and several great restaurants on the 57th floor. Nice and spacy rooms and in view of the giant size of the place: incredibally friendly staff, on every occasion I needed help (my wife got sick during our stay). Not a cosy place though because it is so big. There is no such thing as a reception area with a lounge or bar or anything like it, that we know from ""normal"" hotels. Everything is to be found in the large groundfloor of in the giant shopping centre behind it: restaurants, boutiques, watches, shoes ... you name it, it's there.",4,
"As"" once in a lifetime"" (though I will do my best to return) experiences come this has to be right up there. staff - excellent (thanks to the doorman taking our bags out as we left on Sunday 11th Feb at 17.00) we managed to book in 5 hours early thanks to a very helpful receptionist. Room - we had the basic de-luxe room on the 2nd floor of tower 3 and it was really very good. The roof top pool etc -  you have to be there to appreciate it, fantastic. Building - very impressive, huge but not intimidating. Value for money - not cheap but I dont think anything else in the world would compare. I will return.",5,
"We have yet to even step into MBS hotel and we are already faced by the poorly handled customer service provided by your BayFloral team (Maria Savirimuthu).   We are trying to arrange floral decorations for a unique experience and we believe that MBS will do a good job. Yet in the midst of communication, we are taken aback by the service of your staff. How can one reply with ""So sorry - i do not know your name"" in one of the corresponding official business email to us while in previous corresponding emails by the same person, it was addressed as ""Dear Sir/Mdm"". This clearly implies a very bad example of poor customer service.   The replies of the emails were also replied partially which shows this is very unprofessional. In our correspondence, we have requested with regards to…",1,
ArtsScience - a completely new concept for me and wow does it work. You can make your own drawings a part of the immense display walls or play with huge coloured balls which keep changing colour. The whole site is amazing. ,5,
"Initially reception looks very opulent and impressive but it stops there. For the money we paid this is substandard for a fie star hotel. Nothing special about rooms. Service was poor. Essentially like staying in a room in a huge shopping centre. Unless you want to go shopping or to the Casino it is isolated from the main part of Singapore so you can't really walk to anywhere.  While in Singapore we also stayed at another 5 star hotel, we had a suite that cost less than the Maria Bay Sands and it was spectacular. In comparison the Marina is overpriced and I would definitely not stay again or recommend it to anyone.",1,
"Actually it is a good hotel, people/staff make big difference - service is great, though overpriced as it is not that comfortable and luxury as expected. The main attraction is the Infinity Pool, but it is always busy even at 7AM and full of Chinese with selfie sticks.. Worth to stay not longer than a night price wise unless you want to spend  these money in vain as lots of other good hotels in Singapore worthing the money, anyway your choice. Have a good stay!",4,
"This is an iconic building, a symbol of Singapore. What a wonderful place to stay! The views are amazing, the rooms well appointed, clean, lots of towels, toiletries just what you would expect from a five star hotel. The staff are well trained and always charming. The major problem at Marina Bay is some of the other guests. The pool area seems to attract the worst... large groups of young Italian men who play loud music while posing. Women who must have spent the entire day applying makeup, attending the hairdressers etc so they could have numerous photos of themselves at the pool??!! Maybe we hit a bad time... the hotel was full while we were there... but the pool experience was more like a day at a lido on a hot summers day! As I said the staff are excellent but the lack of…",4,

We upgraded to a nice room on the 53rd floor, which gave us access to a nice lounge, providing late breakfast and afternoon snacks.   Pool area is very busy with crazy Asians making strange poses whilst trying to capture a moment! Towels are provided!   Overall amazing experience, which I totally recommend it ",5,
"In so many ways this is an excellent hotel. We paid up for a special occasion visit so the hotel room was huge and the bathrooms etc were excellent.

The CLub 55 is excellent,a nd the staff and service as you would expect is excellent. All this was fantastic.  The infinity pool area however is a disaster,always packed from early hours of the morning, there is a kids area but there dont police it but the key issue is that people from other hotels can pay to use the pool during the day and thus it is always overcrowded, If I am paying $700 a night a seat by the pool should pretty muhc be guaranteed, this was a the only…",3,
It’s an experience to stay in this hotel.  It’s modern and beautiful view.  Most of all it’s an sensational experience to be in The infinity pool on 57th floor.  At night the free light or laser show is ver good.  Just great.,5,
"We stayed here for 4 days during our trip to Singapore and it was just breathtaking!   As soon as you walk in (there is a lot of people/tourists looking around) it’s just amazing.   As a hotel guest we got access to the infinity pool, views are amazing, brilliant service, cocktails are incredible but the pool is FREEZING!!!   Rooms are very spacious, large bed which is comfortable, water replenished everyday & large walk in shower.   During check out time there is a wait for the lift but otherwise an amazing stay and would come back again! ",5,
"We stayed in this hotel in September 2017 and below is an account of what we liked and not like:   What we like: - The hotel offers rooms with basically two views - one facing Gardens by the Bay and the other facing the city. Go for the city view definitely!  - The hotel suite was lovely! It comes with a living room area whereby guests can comfortably sit around and hang out and a separate partition so that your kid(s) can sleep comfortably if you're still hosting friends. - When Singapore has events with fireworks, the fireworks are literally in your face - super spectacular!  - Service is top-notch  - The infinity pool alone is reason enough to select this hotel   What we did not like:  - Stayed in this hotel for a couple of times but it seems like their toilets has a sewage…",4,
"We had booked 2 separate rooms on the Club 55 experience for 1 night for a night of rare  luxury. Well Marina Bay Sands didn't disappoint. The early check in from a really smiley receptionist was a joy and when we later got our room keys they had upgraded us to a shared suite which was absolutely amazing with breathtaking views over the Gardens of the Bay and the numerous tankers out at sea. The iconic pool was also just out of this world and surprisingly, not busy. We also took advantage of the afternoon tea and evening canapes which was also a lovely experience as well as the breakfast. In all the staff were really friendly and helpful and the hotel is an amazing piece of architecture, it was not as busy as we thought it would be apart from the foyer which is to be expected as…",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights in February.  What an great experience! We had a club room on the 49th floor.  The views over the Bay Area were breathtaking.  The club room gives you access to Club 55 on the 55th floor.  Where you can have afternoon tea between 2 and 4pm, and canapés and cocktails between 5 and 7. Along with breakfast in the morning.  This is well worth paying extra for.  For us it was a fantastic experience and we would love to visit again.",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is an iconic landmark in Singapore and I had been wanting to come back and stay here since I first visited Singapore five years ago.   The hotel did not disappoint. The lobby is incredible, the rooms are large and very nicely decorated and the infinity pool, whilst always busy, was an experience not to be missed. The only suggestion for improvement is to provide some outdoor furniture for the balcony. It was a huge outdoor space with an amazing view but we couldn’t sit down out there and it enjoy it.  The only real disappointment I experienced during my stay was the Singapore Sling I ordered pool side. It was simply awful. The Adrift bar downstairs makes an incredible Singapore Sling so I was genuinely surprised at how bad it was. Perhaps they need to send…",5,
"Next time, maybe we will book a room for the night, if only to have a swim in the amazing and unique infinity pool...  But we stopped by to check out the iconic design of Marina Bay Sands. Based on a friends recommendation, we made our way up to the restaurant next to the infinity pool. It is free to go up and you don't even need to buy anything, but we had a (rather expensive) drink each, took in the breathtaking views and saw the infinity pool. The alternative is to pay to go to the viewing deck, where arguably you might get the same (or improved) views, but at a higher price.  Either way, make your way to the top of the complex and see Singapore from a different angle. And if you can afford it, splash out for a night at the resort and enjoy living in luxury.",4,
2nd time came here. This is a mandatory list right? Always amazed with this place. The first place to visit on this trip with my bestie. And we’re so lucky coz we saw a show here.That’s the best part. ,5,
"Marine Bay Sands is a beautiful hotel and icon of Singapore. The decor and architecture of the building really makes an impression. Our room was located on the 42nd floor and offered a balcony with a beautiful view of the Singapore strait and gardens. It was really spacious and elegant. The biggest attraction of the hotel is the swimming pool on the 57th floor, which is really unusual. Very rich breakfast, however some of the local dishes were a bit strange. Helpful and friendly staff. Hotel very well located, close to the underground, shopping center, gardens and Singapore Flyer. A great hotel for holidays, sightseeing and business. I can really recommend.",5,
This hotel so perfect!!!! Cant wait to go back. Love the pool and everything inside the hotel😭❤️❤️❤️ the staff also so nice!! So help full. Thankyou so much. Definitely will come back soon. So I recommend to you guys who want stay in Singapore!! Its worth it! Even lil bit expensive! But you will chill and relax in this hotel❤️😍😍😍,4,
"My husband planned this staycation to celebrate my birthday. Check-in was smooth and our room was lovely. The pool was busy but we expected it.  Our stay was pleasant until nightmare struck at 11 pm, when what sounded like 5 teenagers slamming doors, stamping their feet along the corridor, and talking at the top of their voices, woke us up. We waited 5 min for the noise to die down. When it didn’t, we called the reception, who said they would be sending security guards up to check. Whether they came up soon enough and resolved the issue, we did not know, for at quarter past 11, the noise returned. Called the reception again, received the same response.  Furious that we were then wide awake and disturbed, we called the reception again and asked to speak to the manager. We wanted…",1,
"Marina Bay Sands is not only a luxurious hotel, I would call it a mini city. Even though we were only in Singapore for 24 hours (due to a plane delay), our time at Marina Bay Sands was a delightful one. The staff were incredibly friendly and always smiling.   The hotel, made up of three towers with a boat shaped swimming pool was five star accomodation at its finest. The weather was miserable and it rained, however it didn't stop us from going into the infinity pool and experiencing that amazing view of the city. There are some spas for those that have not so kind weather.   The hotel room was spacious, decor was practical and colour co-ordinated. The bed was comfortable, and if you don't have a universal adapter, don't worry as the plug fits most country plugs. We had a lovely…",5,
"Great place to stay , with MRT running right under. High shopping are housed within the Hotel. They have 3 towers world in its own. The infinity pool at the top floor is accessed by guests only. The lady manning that is bit rude . So do carry ur hotel cards with u, as one entry per card. Buffet served st Rise is funtastic with wide range of menus. Again standing in queue to get in is bit of an disappointment for this class of Hotel. Overall gr8 place. ",5,
"If you are looking for a relaxing hotel in the heart of Singapore this is NOT the right hotel. TONS AND CROUDS OF PEOPLE!!! We've ordered Orchids Suite room but this room don't cost its money at all. As hotel is very touristic and the hotel has to be renovated, the rooms are very-very old right now.  The pool was so crowded that you even cannot find free sunbed to put your towel, so we were very disappointed about that too. We've stayed 3 days in the hotel and won't visit the pool other two days.  The only good thing in the hotel that in each room there are huge windows you so may enjoy the view.  But all my conclusion is that this is just a regular touristic hotel and nothing else, so if you want to enjoy good room and best service in the hotel and relax time this is NOT the…",2,
"Location: The hotel is located in city center just about 30 minutes from the airport. You can reach the hotel by taxi (20-25S$) or metro (Bayfront Station). The metro station is a part of huge building complex consisting of the hotel (core of the complex), big shopping mall (unfortunately selling only luxury brands at high price) and corridors to the park Gardens by the Bay. Due to excellent metro system it is easy to reach any interesting place of Singapore from the hotel. The building complex with marvelous park Gardens by the Bay have been built on landfill and forms itself a city center.  Public areas of the hotel: The hotel is huge (somewhere was mentioned 2500 rooms). It has 57 floors. The hotel consists of three towers connected to each others through about 200 meters…",4,
A very Big Resort in the light country singapore The hotel is great staff is excellent we stayed in the grand club room the club at the top is just an experience not to miss 4 stars as there are services which can be improved further like they are short of check in counters and the luggage arrives to your room hours after also there is no proper greet on arrival you have to find luggage porters to get your luggage collected room service is also Too slow,4,
"I have just checked into the Marina Bay Sands and feel completely disappointed with the value for money. This is the most expensive hotel we have stayed in, we have a view of a highway on the 4th floor (although we accept there is not a guarantee of room floor), and the ""deluxe room"" we paid for doesnt even have a bath. What five star hotel deluxe room doesn't even have a bath? We are paying an extortionate amount of money, and for any extra they demand even more if we want a bath! Stay somewhere cheaper and you will get much better value. The room is average, and have stayed in much nicer hotels for a fraction of the price. ",1,
"This place just screams greed wherever you go. There's a fridge full of drinks that as soon as you literally lift, it charges your hotel account with it. The staff literally comes around you every hour to ask you if you need anything, no, I will not tip you, go away. When I went to the pool on the last floor, the guy that stands next to the magnetic card reader(you need to be signed in the hotel to get in the pool), have an attitude worthy of a full-arm slap. When it started pouring down and I was trying to get to cover, one of those guys was holding me back and I had to get my card out and stay under the rain because of this idiot. I wish I could use profanity to tell you what I told to that guy, but this review would probably be flagged as inappropriate. Yeah, the rooms are…",1,

We had our room on the 30th.floor on tower number one.Very beautiful room with the great view of the ocean.The hotel is very Hugh with three towers and on top  at 57th  floor connecting is a ship like structure which has a huge swimming pool and restaurant.

My Instagram followers loved my pictures as well :P  Room: We booked Premier Room and stayed at the 45th floor, if I recall well :) The room was quite spacious and extremely clean, the balcony was small but stunning. The view from our room were over the park so both during day and night was amazing. It's a shame using the blind while here :) The bathroom was very spacious as well, well cleaned, amenities replaced twice a day, together with complimentary water and change of towels.Room services were definitely perfect.

Loved our second stay at MBS. Fantastic hotel – genuinely a 5 star experience. We enjoyed great views from our room over Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. The bed was huge and comfortable and the bathroom was very large and well appointed – lovely products too. The highlight is the Sky Deck. The view from the 57th floor is AMAZING!! Early morning swims - to watch the sunrise and before the day heats up - are wonderful. Hope to visit again soon,5,
"We came off a cruise & spent an extra night in Singapore before flying home. This hotel is only a few minutes drive from the cruise terminal. We checked in early however as the rooms weren’t ready yet we were able to leave our luggage at the drop off & went to explore. Sensational hotel. Every high end designer store is here. Great food court. We had Deluxe King City View room. Very spacious, great bathroom & amenities. View was amazing. Pool was spectacular & definitely photo heaven. Yes, crowded & hard to get a sun lounge seat but we got lucky & found a couple straight away. Great breakfast the following morning at Rise/Renku. We checked out, put bags in drop off & continued to ArtScience museum & shoppes for a few more hours. Worth a stay. It was wonderful. ",4,
"We recently stayed there for three days. The architectural design of the hotel is spectacular especially for the roof top terrance swimming pool. But we were very disappointed because it was way way too over crowded with noisy guests. Even our grand children of 4 and 9 found it annoying to stay there. As a result, we only used this facility twice for less than an hour each. Basically we just took couple of photos there. We found it not worth paying so much more for better five stars hotels just for that experience.",5,
"We arrived after 6 days in Cambodia, Mark at check in was very polite and efficient, he told us because we upgraded through Planet Cruise, our room didn’t have a view. We were ok with that but Mark told us he was upgrading our room without charge. When we arrived at the room, we were chuffed to see a large outside terrace through the automatically opening curtains, overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. The rest of our room was lovely, comfortable beds and chairs. Terrific breakfast on the ground floor restaurant, again with friendly helpful staff. The pool was WOW, enough said. Coming back next year with our mums.😀",5,
This place is very beautiful. Sky parks and drive is must go for the people visiting Singapore . All things under one roof. Casinos are little expensive but a must visit for enjoyement. For kids you have parks and observatory. ,5,
"We have stayed twice in 4 years .  It might be the most photographed building in the world it truly is an amazing structure. It is a great location handy to the train ,gardens , loads restaurants shops shops and more shops they have a casino it is not fancy but good .we had a nice win 🙂The  casino has Robots that roam around for you to grabs free water or soft drink 🥤  Walking distance to catch a boat .  We had a Marina King Deluxe room , great views large full bathroom good vanity space for us ladies to spread out . Supersize shower with a large bench seat in it and a bath .  Absolutely incredible pool selfie Heaven 😂  We did not swim this time it is crazy busy .  There is plenty to do up top even if you are not swimming .  ",4,
"We stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights early February. From the moment we walked through the door we were greeted and welcomed by friendly staff. Upgraded to club55 which was well worth the money to get breakfast, afternoon tea and free drinks each afternoon.  We couldn’t wait to visit the infinity pool and it didn’t disappoint. We spent time around the pool at different times on the 3 days and have to say the view at night is amazing.  I can’t see how anyone would write anything bad about this hotel, it’s a must visit place! ",5,
booked this hotel to experience the infinity pool . Not disappointed as it was amazing .  Be warned the water is freezing though but you have to grin and bear it to get that all important selfie.  It’s not a place to relax though too noisy with all the excitement.   Separate adult area . Go early morning when it’s a little quieter.   Breakfast on 57 th floor unless you go early you will have to queue and tables are very low. We found a much better breakfast buffet in the hotel lobby but SGSG b go early before 9am to avoid queues . Bedrooms well furnished and very functional and comfortable.  Advisable to email before arrival to request high floor !  Extremely busy lobby as it is a tourist attraction in itself .  A fantastic experience  ,5,
"I watched the TV show about the hotel and was amazed by their staff uniform system, and the effort put into running a hotel of that size. I hoped  to find a downside to it all as it's all so extravagant and I usually prefer smaller boutique hotels with that personal touch.  But I couldn't help but be blown away by the place.  The design of the building is amazing and everywhere I looked there was something to admire.  Having said that most of Singapore is as beautiful and maybe it the feng shui that does actually work! The staff were very friendly and chatted to us about working there, we happened to get checked in early so we used the the pool when it was fairly empty.",5,
"we stayed in a club king room with a city view. Basically it was fantastic, as is the entire hotel. The staff are courteous and very friendly. we enjoyed all the facilities of the club 55 lounge. On the whole a very memorable stay.",5,
"I actually forgot to provide a review since we booked last October 2017. This is our 2nd time to experience MBS. I just cant believe I'd smell a foul sweat on its sheets when it's supposed to be new! I mean, its a 5 star hotel! Of course I had to call someone to have the sheets replaced with a new one. Please be advised to check on the sheets before trying to dive in. ",3,
"I was there in December. Awful. The rooms are nice and harbour view is great, but hotel overcrowded and full of kiddies, that just go there for posing and to post selfies on Instagram (at least, it seems so). Did they all won in the lottery that they can afford to pay this unacceptable bad price/quality relation? View over Singapur is spectacular, but famous Pool overcrowded, cold water and wind (you definitvely will freeze there even at >90 Fahrenheit outside) and some of the women jump with full clothes and scarfs into the pool. Service is good, but definitively overprized. If you want, stayx there just for 1 night, but no more!! Those who wanna go there on the roof, nice bars and restaurant with free access.",3,
"The pool area is a joke. Someone stole chair i was Useing; while I was in the pool, when I complaint the staff just send me away to find Another one. The dude I was talking was a major Jerk. I havnt tried anything like it. Definetly NEVER goin back. ",1,
Unique hotel with spectacular view in Singapore ! Amazing infinity pool but too crowded ! Breakfast better in the ground floor than rooftop ! Huge hotel. Music not appropriate for the bar in the ground floor,4,
"Marina Bay Sands is a Singapore resort that looks like a ship balanced on three pylons.  In addition to the complex’s 2,561-room hotel, there is an exhibition center, casino, theater, shopping mall, an art and science museum, and many 5-star restaurants  On the roof top, there is an infinity pool only open to guests.  The skylark provides a 360-degree panoramic view of Singapore is open to everyone for approximately $20 USD.  Sampan rides are available for guests and shoppers. If you do not stay overnight, a visit to this attraction is a “must”.",4,
"Good: - gorgeous hotel - after some wrangling got free breakfast because there was a dirty sanitary pad stuck to the shower room's wall Bad: - there was a dirty sanitary pad stuck to the shower room's wall - there are people who hang a dirty sanitary pad to a shower room's wall and just leave it there  To be fair the pad was pretty high up and if you're short you could easily miss it, so I don't blame the cleaning crew. But still not a great thing to experience for a 700$ per night hotel.",2,
there are types of tickets for observation area. 1 ticket is $23 and you are just allowed on observation deck the 2nd ticket is for drinks or lunch which is $20 but this is then taken off your bill. The views were excellent and the food faultless. Would highly recommend lunch here it was well worth the visit.,5,
"I was in Singapore for one night and thought I had the see for myself the Marina Bay. How disappointing. The rooms are very boring,  the pool area was busy and I understand why however it was very tatey  and unloved the food was mass produced rubbish. I'm finding it difficult to say anything nice about the place apart from the engineering of the building. Having said that I had just stayed 4 nights at the Bangkok Oriental Mandarin. In my opinion one of the best hotels in the world ",2,
"It was a special birthday celebration. I live in Singapore, but my cousin who shares my birthday flew in from the UK and we decided to celebrate at MBS. I booked the Orchid Suite with City View. This is the only type of suite with a Master bedroom and a dividing wall with two sliding doors creating a separate sleeping area. At night housekeeping turns the sofa into a bed. The suite is HUGE-you walk in to a large hallway with floor to ceiling mirrors, and a lovely towel elephant with orchids to greet us:) then a large dining room (table and four chairs) with 'kitchen' (coffee, tea, and minbar),then the large sitting room and office.On the other side of the wall the equally huge Master Bath-two sinks, lovely tub, separate shower and toilet.This is accessible from both sleeping…",4,
"Loved everything about this hotel. Views from the balcony are to die for- We could see Indonesia's lights in the distance while over looking the gorgeous Botanical Gardens and our bathroom (bath) had gorgeous views of the river and city. The views/lights at night time really are beautiful...Worth getting a club room as it includes b/fast, afternoon tea (2-4pm)and evening drinks and nibbles (5-7.00pm). This actually saves you money buying snacks...Nothing is skimped on, the hotels toiletries are even 5 star quality. Staff and service is amazing. They remember your name and room number and call you by your name each time you enter the restaurant or lounge. I would definitely stay here again. Expensive but worth every cent.",5,
The hotel is very beautiful rooms are very spacious and the staff is very courteous and friendly .swimmimg pool is always crowded but the view is breathtaking leaves you with a top of the world feeling !!!,5,
"Maybe the most astonishing hotel, even from its looks. It became a landmark of Singapore and it is a worthy experience of staying there. The hotel is huge, but the staff are very eager to help in a swift. Breakfast is very delicious, and has many kinds you can choose from. The only cons are that there are too many people including the tourists and the hotel guests. If you want a remote atmosphere, you should try find a different place.",5,
"Last time here, i said to my self won’t stay here anymore. What can i say, we just keep coming back. Now to get to the pool you need a card, so don’t forget to tell that you are travelling with children so you’ll get extra card. Quite annoying since you cannot put one card in the room for a running aircon and electricity. I guess will be back in another 3 years...",4,
"When you are super seniors, you usually stay at quiet quality hotels...  but we still wanted to try the pool and the view everybody's talking about. Third time in Singapore and we had a week of get-away to arrange a surprise 60th party for a in-law also flying in from Sweden. Before the party we stayed for a trial night here. We understood from the beginning that this was a huge hotel with up to 2500 guests a day, so we booked Club Room for the access to Club 55 Lounge. This was a right decision we took and we had a quiet breakfast and evening with the best view without hustle.and bustle. We did not go out at all but enjoyed Club Lounge's good service and food. The pool was time to time a kind of crowded but it was not impossible to take photos of ourselves .... after the…",4,
"We stayed here for one night after the cruise just to tick one of the bucket list. Well you have to stay to use the pool. Forget the negative reviews you are staying here for the pool and to say, you have been there done that. Yes it is crowded at check in and check out but depends when you do it. We got in early and still checked in. We would have got our room if it was available but were still given early access to the pool and they texted us when the room was ready which was well before check in time on their website. We had a room on the third tower, 49th floor. What a view wall to ceiling windows. Good size room only thing it would be nice to have automatic lights for the bathroom at night.

"We chose Marina Bay Sands because of the building and the sky pool, prior our arrival we weren’t sure if we were going to be comfortable in such a big hotel as we prefer smaller boutique hotels.  Our check in was fast and after  10 minutes we were in our room. A spacious room with a lovely garden view on the 39th floor. It was comfortable and with all the amenities we need it.  We chose to have breakfast at the SkyPark with view the first day, it was Sunday we had to wait for 15 minutes to be sited but the following days everything was quicker. The breakfast was good. Only complaint was the second day they forgot our eggs and when we asked for them they said they couldn’t do something as the kitchen was closed, it was their mistake they should have find a solution more…",5,

Giant infinity pool with best view or the city Great breakfast spread  Huge shopping mall with up class brands to choose from Great dining options from local taste in Rasapura food court to Celebrity restaurants Gardens by the bay is 5 minutes walk from the hotel, which is the top tourist attraction    The hotel is pricy but totally worth it. I would stay again if my pocket allows. 5 stars",5,
"This is not the first time I am staying at Marina Bay Sands, but I reckon this would be my last.   The crowd at check-in and everywhere at the hotel was just insane! To be fair, the hotel tried their best to manage to the best of their capability. But how do you remain efficient and keep customers happy when you have tons of guests?   1. The check-in queue was like people were queuing for free rooms - we waited for 45 Mins to get our keys. Kudos to the hotel for constantly offering ice-cream, juices and water, but a long wait is just a long wait.   2. You wait forever to get a lift, and when you are in there, you stop at so many levels before you get to yours. Simply because it’s overcrowded.   3. Infinity pool is always full of people and you never see a deck chair free. And so…",2,
"We stayed here for 1 night to pamper ourselves!  The staff were extremely friendly.  You can find a shopping mall, casino, restaurants all within the hotel.  Gardens by the bay is within walking distance, we could see the garden from our hotel room view.  The pool was definitely worth visiting!  The view was unreal and peaceful.",5,
"We stayed in a suite overlooking the harbour complete with balcony!  Although not overlooking the city it was great t watch the boats and the lights at night!  By far the reason we came here was for the infinty pool and it did not dissapoint.  If anything i would ask if the pool could be heated more as when we were there it was chilly. The room was well appointed with everything you could need, comfy beds, great bathroom with full amenity kits!  We would highly recommend this hotel complex and the shopping precinct.",5,
"This hotel is amazing - admittedly very large & busy, in fact, totally alien to my usual haunts but wow, it is a very well oiled machine. There are 3 main towers & it isn’t too far from the airport or Marina Cruise Terminal & taxis are relatively cheap in Singapore. The architecture is stunning from both the outside & I side. I was blown away. Level 57 is where the famous infinity pool is housed.   Spectacular & a must but you cannot get in unless you are an hotel guest as there are machines with bouncers where you insert your room key both in & out. Anyone trying to use your key for a second run will be stopped!  The Asian Restaurant was excellent & the cocktails overlooking the view of the CBD are excellent - however, you so pay for the view - but hey, it’s a one off…",5,

"Stayed for 1 night as a stopover to Australia. We chose this hotel as we’d seen it on TVs show amazing hotels.  The infinity pool is amazing. What a view. Pool is not deep and it’s the selfie destination pose. Everyone has their phone in the pool! Open late.  You can get pool service for drinks and food and there is also. Restaurant where you don’t need to be a resident to enjoy the views, you just can’t use the pool. The observation deck is open to public and residents. We were very kindly upgraded as it was our first visit to Singapore and were upgraded to 27th floor overlooking the gardens, which was amazing.

Well I am more catered to  boutique hotels or at least the hotels that cater to the guest in MBS not really you are number lines for everything not really to be liked and you get annoyed because your paying a hefty fee and if you want to order your eggs any differently than they have good look be aware that the night can be advertised at a rate but the taxes are very steep I would recommend to pay for the pool which everyone can do it and stay elsewhere although I went to the pool be used to the garlic mixture of odors and the crowed population that seems you are bathing in the gengis river, don’t get wrong…",3,
"Not worth the trouble. Lines every morning for breakfast, not something that is expected from a 5 star hotel. More like a railway station than anything else.  If visiting for the pool, spend a night and move somewhere else. The pool itself gets very crowded and is no fun after the initial awe wears off.  Awesome hardware but they lack the software and the crowds don’t help either.",3,

Yes, it is quite a long walk to everywhere. Yes, the pool and the view is insane. But I am glad we stayed here (we stayed here for 2 nights, but at least 1 night is needed). I was a little worried when booking this hotel due many negative reviews. However, after voicing my concerns when booking, we were looked after beautifully. Staff are so kind and friendly, especially when looking after so many people.

"We travel to Singapore often and love the city as the local Singaporians are always super kind and helpful and friendly. However, the hotels seem to  consistently fall short on one level or another.. For instance, we like shopping and gambling so we thought we would try the marina bay sands despite their pricey rooms and restaurants.. Check in was straight forward and the nice Philippine lady at the front desk who served us was cordial and polite.. Walking into this huge open air establishment is very impressive and would be to even the most seasoned traveller.. Once we got to our room it was clean and standard and nothing very special.. the TV was mounted crooked and the Air-conditioner was noisy (rattling) and didn’t provide for a peaceful night sleep unfortunately. We ordered…",2,

Yes it is $20 pp to access the roof top which is refunded via a drink + taxes. This really is a must see opportunity you will not regret. The views stretching across the entirety of Singapore stretching out from the dock is incredible. The massive infinity pool in unaccessible unless you are a hotel guest however, you can still take photos and see everyone loving their swim, selfie moments. Wonderful experience.",4,
"Sorry about this long winded rant... we'd stayed at the W in Sentosa before arriving here, and were blown away by how amazing it was, which only magnifies how bad our stay was at Marina Bay.  We really could not wait to leave this hotel, and were so disappointed given we left this till the end of our trip as we expected it to be the highlight.  First, the good stuff: the pool. It's really quite an experience to be sitting 57 levels up, with that infinity pool. We loved it, and really tried to cherish what is a once in a lifetime experience.   That's all the good stuff I have about this resort unfortunately.

Arrived late 22pm and the only less god thing is that you so not have acces to poolarea if you have checked out - and check out is 1 PM so I ""missed"" the afternoon in the Fantastic poolarea. Expensiv but nice to have done.",5,
"Paid $2000 for 2 nights having checked out of the awesome Shangri-La and expected something special. Summary of experince as follows:  Highs: The view. Although a visit to one of the bars or restaurants gives the same view  Room was quiet.  Lows: Upon checkout you are barred from the pool, gym etc and effectively kicked out of the hotel’s faciities-never in the world have I experienced this level of exclusion upon checkout.   Internet is dreadfully slow and you need to login each time you move around the hotel.  Food by the pool is genuinely dreadful and you get better in the street.  Long queues for breakfast  Service is abysmal. Too many people and not enough staff. This is a tourist attraction and not a luxury hotel.  Top tip: Stay at one of the fabulous 5* hotels jn…",1,
"We visited this hotel shortly after it opened and vowed to stay there on our next visit to Singapore. Such a wonderful one night stay and definitely a splurge to book a club room for 3 persons. We were allowed to check in early so were able to spend nearly 2 days enjoying the infinity pool. We were also upgraded to an Orchid Suite which had beautiful views to the city from one side of the room and which had 2 balconies that overlooked Marina Bay Sands. Staff in Club 55 (for afternoon tea and evening canapés), Spago on the sky deck (for breakfast) were very gracious as were the pool staff, the bell staff and reception personnel. The hotel is very crowded but the elevators moved quickly; even the crowds at the pool made for great people-watching. Kudos to the lifeguards who…",5,
"Incredible views and outstanding accommodation in very impressive club room. Love the freshness of the room, amenities and quality of furnishings. Club 55 is a bit chaotic at times with families but the food and service is excellent. My only feedback is that there should be an area in the club set aside for those who are not traveling with children under 12 as it would make the experience for us much much more enjoyable. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,
"The hotel motto is «to exceed your expectations».. They really do..and more so! Amazing staff, facilities, service and food. The famous infinity pool was never too crowded to find a sun bed. We had a club room for our honeymoon and got a nice greeting card and a complimentary bottle of champagne from the hotel. 10/10!",5,
"Truly high class and exquisite experience. Their food was intended for everyone as they were quite bland and you can add up to the saltiness and sweetness. Their rooms are amazingly big and very cozy. The building was entertaining as it has a lot to offer variety of restaurants and a very expensive one downstairs with huge light bulbs as decors, but my father in law loved the chinese food there. My dilemma came as we visited on valentines day. There were too many people and sadly i didnt get a spot to swim as it was congested like sardines in a bottle. We were fighting for our seats at the pool side. They shouldve made the pool in proportion to the guests they accommodate.",3,
"Let's be clear: Marina Bay Sands is not a luxury hotel.  This is obvious from the moment you step inside to be confronted with masses of tourists who look like they've just emerged from cruise ships and coaches. To one side is reception with a huge queue of guests waiting to check-in. The queue remains long the whole time I'm there. Luxury hotels don't have check-in queues!  Luxury hotels also have some sort of personalised experience - staff who remember your name, and greet you as you enter. Marina Bay Sands is deeply impersonal. I never recognised a single staff member and they - not surprisingly - didn't remember me. This hotel is simply too big......there's no one place for breakfast but about a dozen. The entrance slips into a giant (and hideous) shopping mall filled with…",3,
"Stayed there for one night only obviously the main reason was to have access to the pool. The building is an iconic building in the city, the lobby is quite busy to be honest and the check in process took a bit of time due to the long queues. We were staying in the 29th floor, the room was very spacious and had a breathtaking view, definitely worth it. However when we went to the pool we were a bit disappointed, the pool was extremely cold and packed, you can’t enjoy it that much, we went in took few pictures and headed out straight.  The breakfast is really good with a big variety however you have to get there early to avoid queuing for ages.  Overall I can say that it’s a hotel that is worth the visit but a night or two there are more than enough. ",4,
"A must visit when in Singapore. Great infinity pool, high end mall, casino, great food - an amazing time. Expensive - but worth every penny. Its quite an experience. Ce La Vi is awesome ! Service is exemplary and out of the world !",4,
"Booked a large corner suite, felt it lacked any comforts just vast and expensive. We were treated very well, and checked in in our room, if you booked an ordinary room the queues for check in and check out were horrible. It really is something out of Las Vegas, a massive high end shopping mall filled with very expensive names and a casino that must cater for thousands. The breakfast in the ‘Club’ lounge was poor, waited ages for a cup of coffee and on one occasion had to wait 10 mins for a table, you don’t expect this when you pay extra for the ‘Club’ amenities. We eat at their upmarket restaurants, Ce La Vie and Spago and had excellent meals with lots of atmosphere. If you want Vegas in Singapore stay maximum 2 nights.",4,
"Finally checked this hotel off my bucket list! We came here to celebrate our engagement and was not disappointed. When we first checked in we were greeted by Antonio who was extremely friendly. He provided us with a ton of information for our stay as well as other countries we planned on visiting! We were provided with a free upgrade to a higher floor suite with panoramic views of the entire Bay. The pool was more incredible in person than we've seen in pictures, especially at night time giving you a ""pinch me"" feeling overlooking the entire city lights. The drinks are pretty pricey which was expected ($16US & up) but that comes expected with a hotel like this. The rooms and amenities were all first class and we hope to return again one day! ",5,
"The butler were professional and attentive, they really cater our needs in the room.  And of course it is an experience to stay at marina bay sands, with that location and infinity pool! We are in room 2262 tower 2, 22nd floor and the room has balcony facing the garden, it was pretty. And the room was huge. I went here for my birthday where i stayed in premium king with my mom and hubby. I always stay in a relative house whenever i am in singapore so it is exciting to stay in a hotel (-_-“). Honestly, the price is steep for me but with that location, butler service, and the pool, the size of the room, you won’t mind. I stayed for 1 night only cause I couldn’t afford more nights (lol) Also you will get to experience the famous pool! It was windy and cloudy when we were there; to…",4,
"Booked 1 night to stay here, because I always wanted to experience the Infinity Pool. As we came in, it was bit of a shock how crowded and noisy the lobby area was. Not gonna lie, the check-in queue was long and took some time. But staff came to queue to offer water and mini ice creams too, it was a nice surprise. Then it was our turn and the front desk lady was so kind and even offered us an upgrade! The room was way bigger than the one I originally booked! It also had stunning views and perfect for watching the fountain light show. Bed was comfy and I loved the bath tub in our room! Infinity pool area was super crowded, it took sometime to find a chairs for us. But the pool wasn't so crowded, so you could actually take photos very well there. But the pool water is so cold!

"The idea of having a giant luxury hotel with almost 2500 rooms,a high-end luxury mall and glamorous casino in one roof does not sounds really well but The Marina bay sands has proved it to be an outstanding project. I stayed there for 2 nights and we were 5 adults so we booked two orchid suite. The rooms are without a doubt very spacious and gives a feeling of premium luxury. For the prize of any other Ritz Carlton or St. Regis suite i felt some touches and style was missing. Though the toiletries were from the luxury fashion house Roberto Cavalli and the dedicated express butler service always came up with our needs really quick despite the size of this big property and i really want to highlight this because many other luxury hotels around the world 1/5th of the size of marina…",5,
"Always thought next time in Singapore will stay here. Only stayed for one night which in the end was a good call. Queuing for check in, check out was hideous. Long queues at a very small desk for the size of hotel.  Rooms were good and spacious. Great views. Pool on roof underwhelming if I'm honest. It was cold and very packed. Although as aspected it's all about the view. Queues for breakfast, went to restaurant on the roof. Our friends went to buffet breakfast and said it was the same. We must have waited 10 mins after repeatedly asking for coffee.  Glad I did it but was left feeling disappointed.",3,
"Stayed for business. The rooms are very well decorated and equipped and reasonably sized although I was given a relatively crappy room (twin beds, low down above the street with no view). The rooftop infinity pool was very impressive, and the restaurants I visited were busy and well run but the place is just TOO BIG to be pleasant. There are hordes of tourists everywhere...queues, families. It is like being in an airport at holiday time. It is impossible to show guests any sense of refinement on this scale. ",3,
"I visited Singapore back in November 2017 for the first time with family and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 4 nights. It's no doubt a lovely hotel, it has really nice decor and a nice feel about it. The room was lovely and just what we needed.  The infinity pool is definitely worth the trip and is everything that I expected it to be, however now that I have stayed here and have experienced the infinity pool, I don't have a reason to come back to the hotel also you don't get the personal touch as you do in other smaller hotels. The hotel is also a central location and has easy ways to get around Singapore from the hotel. Thanks for a great stay Marina Bay Sands.",4,
"If you want a top rated hotel, stay at the Marina Bay Sands. Yes, it’s a bit more expensive than we normally would spend on a hotel but this was our last vacation night in Singapore and we wanted to splurge a bit. What’s all the hype about? Watch Netflix’s “Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby” to get a sense of the sheer size and amount of work it takes to run this hotel.   We arrived at 8:30 am and pre-checked in the hotel. We checked our luggage, left our email so they could let us know when our room was ready, then headed out to Gardens by the Bay. BTW you can reach this attraction from the hotel by taking the underground walkway through the MRT. By 11:30, we received an email that our room was ready! Our room was a “standard” room but it was spacious with a nice large…",5,
"We loved every bit of our stay in MBS. It was our mini honeymoon treat after touring Asia. Fiona checked us in and upgraded us, to a room with bath tub and facing the city scape. They even sent a complimentary plate of chocolates after we checked in. In room breakfast was amazing. The fitness centre was great too. The downside was the infinity pool was a bit too cold. Otherwise, it was a really good stay and we will be back! ",5,
"A wonderful hotel, great location. You can get to the hotel by train from the airport. There is a shopping mall and train station below the hotel. Close by restaurants, try Gordon Ramsey’s or go to the food court for a cheaper deal. Tea and morning toast at toast box. The pool is amazing.",5,
"from the reception to the concierge, I was very well attended and well treated, I had no problem, the receptionists are friendly and the elevator staff also, the hotel and a mall with lots of luxury shops, restaurants, gym and spa, went in the pool and of course I knew it was crowded with people, it is the most famous pool in the world, we had no problem, after we checked out they still let us shower, I will come back",5,

"Hi, I'm 35+yr old female, stayed here for one night with a friend & booked a Grand Bay View Club Room with the food & drink package.  The booking was directly on their website for $800AUD.    I've stayed here 3 years ago in early November & it was great.  This time during the holiday period, it was a completely different experience.  The driveway is like a traffic jam, the lobby is very busy, check-in takes so long (~20mins wait) and there is no way to avoid a queue anywhere.    Pro's: - The upgrade to Orchid suite on Lv54 was bigger than my house - that was great. (Garden view AND Bay view)  - Obviously the infinity pool is why people stay here - hence very crowded - the adult section is great. (Get there early to secure a lounge) - Gym (with great views), Sauna and hot bath…",4,
This is one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at. The hotel staff are friendly. Hotel room was spacious with plenty of room and spotless. The architecture around this whole hotel is amazing! Endless shops at the marina bay sands shoppes and plenty of restaurants. We had spectacular views of the city and directly at the Merrion park. The pool is something else just behind crazy. The views are amazing the infinity pool is a must see! We didn’t have the best weather but we made sure we still got in for photos. ,5,
"There was no way we didn't go to Singapore and lived at Marina Bay Sands, or so we thought. We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental the first 2 nights and had a marvelous time - their pool was spectacular - very calming and well-run - and left excited to step it up a notch at Marina Bay Sands. Within the first 5 minutes of stepping in to the hotel we already regretted it. It was crowded, loud, and messy in the lobby. Lines were extremely long - we waited in line for 30 MINUTES to check-in (it was worse for check out). But we made it to the pool and it was a total dud. It's great for the first 20 minutes for pictures, until you actually want to be on a chair to relax. They spent very little time designing the environment, people were everywhere (mostly just taking photos and not…",1,
The best hotel I have ever stayed in! We only stayed one night but wish we could of stayed more!  Amazing staff & service from the second we arrived.  The room was absolutely beautiful! We had a stunning view of the gardens.  The rooftop pool & bar was incredible and the food was very good.  Would love to visit again!,5,
"For sure the best part is the pool. It was amazing to see people from all over the world want to take selfies in the pool. Most impressive pool ever. Hotel was expensive, but just for the access to the pool, it was worth it. Additionally, the seafood buffet in the lobby restaurant was just incredible. ",5,
"Ever since watching this hotel on a tv show, I have always wanted to visit Singapore and this hotel. The hotel is rather large and I would suggest only staying here a weekend. It is very ""vegas like."" I would say the pool area staff are a little rude, which semi-ruined my visit here. Overall, the rooms are nice and the hotel is new and the pool is awesome!",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is the place where Luxury meets Style. It was an amazing experience staying at one of the best property in the world. It is a kind of busiest but the executives do have your attention. The huge lobby will amaze you at your first step in. I recommend the higher floor rooms with the Gardens by the Bay view. It truly is stunning from the 35th floor. Rooms are spacious with the right sense of luxury and all facilities to mark up your expectation. Sands have many dining options and they serve almost every cuisine in the world. The eye catching Infinity Pool is the best landmark of Singapore and signature of the Sands. Best part, it is only accessible for the guests staying, so for the experience you need to be different from the odds ;) Marina Bay Sands is not a…",5,
"We had the most amazing 24 hours. A very big thank you to Ella from service management for offering us an extended check out after my son was taken to hospital and making our check out and experience all the more comfortable as we left to go to our next destination. Customer service was 10/10. Room service 10/10. The infinity pool was breathtaking and this place far exceeded our expectations after reading some not so nice reviews, I can confirm we never experienced any disappointment. We called for extra quilts and pillows a few times that arrived within a few minutes. In room dining was better than most five star dining experiences I’ve had, hands down to some amazing chefs who work here. Thank you it was amazing ❤️",5,
"It's a beautiful property and probably the best Singapore has to offer, but the service of the hotel staff needs to be better. The rooms are clean and the views from the infinity pool is fantastic.  Also, the casino doesn't have a bar, which is a bit let down, although the casino itself is the best in Asia in my opinion.",4,
"Having stay at several of the 5-star offerings in Singapore over the last 15 years, I was very keen to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for the finally. Let me first say the complex both hotel, shopping centre and other facilities is enormous. It takes a bit of getting about especially if you're keen on accessing the club and rooftop pool levels. The service was faultless and rooms of an excellent standard, have stayed in two sizes of suite. I would go as far to say the rooms are a lot better value per night than what we are charged here in Australia and that's coming from a person who has access to corporate shareholder rates at the closest comparable hotel and casino property in Melbourne. I'd definitely consider staying at Marina Bay Sands again especially for the convenience of…",4,
"Obviously we chose this hotel because the pool is the basically the holy grail for shooting instagram photos. This was a short Winter break for us to get out of COLD NYC. We stayed from 01/11/18-01/16/18. We booked through our Citi Prestige Concierge and total was about $350/night USD for a Citi View King Premier room. I was worried this hotel we going to rest on it's gimmick of having it's infinity pool with an amazing view. Thankfully that is not the case. The service and attention to detail were great and I would highly recommend it!

Coming from Malaysia, the cost is actually quite high and we were hoping that it lived up to its pricey cost.  It did. We had no regrets at all. All of us enjoyed our stay there.  The room was spacious, clean, well-equipped. I had a nice balcony with a wonderful view of the sunrise.  The check-in experience was pleasant - they were even giving out free ice-creams to us!  We took the room that gave us excess to Club 55 - we had our breakfast there, afternoon tea and evening canapes. the breakfast and evening canapes were simply excellent!!!! It was a small regret that we spent too much for the afternoon tea, then went to the skypark and was late for the evening canapes.  The service…",5,
"Well what can you not possibly love about this place.  Even on a busy day you can find a quiet spot. Something truly special about singapore is marina bay sands. They have the Sky gardens and they so much space in a city. You could spend the day here for free. It does cost to get into the Sky gardens and other tours but you can walk around yourself for free. I waited until the evening for the lights to switch on in the gardens and it truly blew me away!!!   It's a special place and you can go alone, as a couple or even with a young family. ",5,
"I don't know where else to write this review, but I was really impressed with their customer service. I am from the Philippines, and I tried booking tickets for their Art Meets Science museum and exhibition. I had problems booking my ticket, so I sent them an email. I was surprised that someone actually called me from Marina Bay Sands asking me if I still needed help booking my ticket. I don't know the name of the lovely lady who assisted me, she mentioned her name but I couldn't catch it. :( I just wanted their staff to know that I appreciate the extra mile of asking and checking on their customers. They replied to my email, and called me on my personal phone number.",5,
The food tastes heavenly and accommodation is superb although I've to say. Good quality food and service comes at a price. This is not a cheap stay but if you're on a getaway staycation with a love one Marina Bay Sands is a good choice especially if you saved for the occasion. We'll be back. :),5,
"Lovely spot to have a sneaky cocktail and take pics - fans of F1 will love it :) Bit pricey - but a 'must do' - if want to spend more there are plenty of places to eat, drink, shop. Bit of a trek to get to but can't beat the view.",5,
this hotel is absolutely stunning! the luxury and quality of service you get is unbelievable. you'll feel it the moment you set foot there.i got a complimentary upgrade to a room with a view on the 45th floor which was more than satisfactory. spending my last day in singapore on their infinity pool was an incredible end to my trip! thank you so much i will definitely come back :D,5,

"We chose this hotel for the pool and it certainly didn’t disappoint!  Absolutely loved it!  The views are amazing, there is an adult’s only section which was perfect for us and great cocktails.  The hotel rooms are really large and have a classic décor and there are lots of shops and restaurants in the complex.  We will stay here again when next in Singapore.",5,
"Brilliant fun - loved it! ( and I wasn't sure I would ). It is expensive but it was awsome - the shear expanse and height of the place, the free room upgrade, marvellous food, viewing deck and of course - THAT POOL!  The bar next to the pool was super chilled and played surprisingly good tunes.THAT VIEW! Late night swim highly recommended. Also check out the Club 55 deal ( no brainer) separate fast check -in, afternoon tea, canapés/drinks 5-7pm with endless Champagne. We only stayed one night at Marina Bay Sands but it seemed like enough time - we got an early 11am check-in, emailed in advance to request this ( although they made no promises).

"This was a treat for my wife, who had heard about a hotel in Singapore that had an infinity pool on the roof. The hotel is part of a very large complex with a huge mall. The hotel is enormous, as you can see from the photos.

"Well the hotel itself is not bad , clean and with a magnificent view from the pool . But since we booked the lowest category of room because we was staying for barely 1 night , we saw that the room was just at its very basic point . Nothing special really . This is none of a cheap hotel and highly rated in Singapore which is known for being an expensive country in Asia , but still it was rated no. 1 on TA so we wanted to give it a try but at our disappointment , we was not wowed by this hotel at all and find it a bit overrated . Still it’s a good hotel and with a good service and delicious food .  Would not mind giving it another shot next time but with a much higher room category I guess . ",3,
We stayed there for two nights... great location and in great proximity of many attractions. Whilst it has some 2500 rooms we didn’t feel lost in the hotel. We were staying in one of the suites overlooking the harbour....simply amazing!! We were part of the Club 55 which was well worth it!!!,5,
"I’m a big luxury hotel traveller so it’s needless to say when I went on my honeymoon I wanted to stay in the best place. I had been told many reports on how amazing marina bay sands was, and from the outside one would agree! From the service I found it average, reason being when we arrived in a taxi the person collecting the bags only helped on the last suitcase and watched us pulling out our own luggage.... never does that happen in any hotel, there was a line to check in, and most importantly when I told them it was my honeymoon they pretended they didn’t know and sent us 3 small chocolates to our room in which they gave to all the guests.... the St Regis made a fuss, gave us a cake and free drink nothing major but it was lovely to be congratulated . Marina bay has this great…",2,

"If you accept that you are paying for the privilege of swimming in the world’s most famous pool & the location, you’ll be very happy with this hotel. I would like to give it four and a half stars, but this rating does not exist.   We loved our Gardens on the Bay view, which also looked out to sea where there was an astonishing number of ships. Being able to walk right out on to Gardens on the Bay was also magnificent.   The room was nothing special given the price you pay (there were some great towel animals when we came in, a remote control for curtains etc.). The double beds seemed smaller than usual. The bathroom was lovely, with some very upmarket toiletries, and there was a telephone next to the toilet, which we had never encountered before. We had room service which was…",4,
Excellent property...very nice rooms excellent and a HUGE variety of food.! the last floor of the hotel has a swimming pool which is an iconic place in Singapore. Location of this hotel is very nice.The architecture of the property is amazing specially the infinity pool which offers a breath taking view of the whole city of Singapore and the glass sections offer a heart stopping view.,5,
"The accommodation is not only ridiculously expensive but not worth it. What use is an infinity pool""  anyway?  Unless you happen to be a complete drop-kick who wants to waste his or her money, pop up to the 57th floor and enjoy the view for SGD20.  You'll get it back anyway  as you sip a cocktail as you look over Singapore with absolutely nothing in front of you, unless a storm is rolling in, which makes it even more special.  I can recommend Once Upon a Thai to use up your SGD20.  Just hope there's a storm in the offing.  ",4,
My girlfriend and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel only for one night and it's been one of the most amazing experience we ever had in our whole life!!! The hotel room was absolutely beautiful and huge. The staff were simply amazing. Everyone is very helpful and kind. We have definitely chosen this hotel for the amazing view from the swimming pool: something to die for!!!  If you are in Singapore you MUST go there.,5,
"Room is very spacious . The infinity pool is spectacular,  very unique. encourage to visit both day and night as it's totally different.  They only allow hotel guests to visit so it's  not over crowded. Service staffs really need rooms for improvement for hospitality . You normally will not be greeted with a welcome smile . ",3,
"The three towers of this hotel dominate the Singapore Harbors  skyline. The infinity pool on the top floor spins the three towers with a bar and restaurant. In order to use the pool you must be a registered guest but is worth the high price they charge.   If you have spent the time and money to travel to Singapore, this is a must.",5,
"Great location, great service, the view is amazing. Infinite pool is spectacular. Hotel is walking distance to Garden by the Bays. Food is quite expensive however. Best to eat elsewhere is you are looking for a bargain.",4,
We stayed at MBS on a 24 Hour stop off on the way to Australia. Impressive hotel from the outside and very smart and clean inside. Handy from the airport. We were delighted to get a check in on arrival at 6.45am having been told by email there were no promises. Staff we met were all lovely especially the chap at the taxis kiosk this morning at 4am. Would probably not stay again- very big and impersonal- very much like Atlantis in Dubai. ,3,
"Spent 3 nights with my partner last week as part of our Eastern Adventure.  What. A. Hotel.   You can see from any google images that this place is visually incredibly special, and very well equipped with shopping, restaurants, bars, casino, rooftop pool (which by the way, is as incredible as it appears).  What these pictures don’t tell you, is the phenomenal way in which every employee you interact with treats you. Both my partner and I were treated like royalty the entire time we were there, and it was beyond impressive. From the room attendants leaving us towel animals on the bed, to the room service asking about our day - MBS has got service Bang on.  I would urge anyone going to Singapore to stay at MBS. Yes, it’s not cheap but it’s definitely worth it.  ",5,
"It’s pricey,it’s hectic,it’s over-the -top; however, I would strongly recommend at least one stay in this iconic hotel. Surprisingly ,even at full occupancy,the service is personal and efficient.Room service always under 30 minutes. Of course the pool area spanning over 3 towers is the site to see .Nothing like it anywhere! And executive lounge access is a must as it could possibly be the best in the world! With its free flowing French champagne and real gourmet food and deserts,coupled with smiling efficient service I cannot think of a close competitor,maybe the Shanghai Mandarin. There are great restaurants and the best coffee/ pastry shop in Singapore. All in all splurge and visit this architectural marvel!",5,
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands.  What an Awesome choice the hotel has so.much to offer and so pleased with our choice. We watched a tv programme about hotel and bit did not disappoint. The swimming pool was amazing and you can only use if you are a resident of the hotel. You can pay and access the viewing platform if you are not staying at hotel. Rooms are amazing and very comfortable. We had the buffet breakfast in the international restaurant...wow so much choice certainly worth a visit. The hotel is perfectly situated for all tour holiday activities so perfect in every way.,5,
"It was a good experience for a one night stay, similar to staying in a hotel in Las Vegas. It's not my favourite type of tourism but it's worth to know the hotel, pool and the views at least once. The hotel is super crowded all the time, it's like staying in a mall, we stayed in the 45th floor and the view from the room was awesome. There is not much to do except walking through a fancy mall, a casino, go out for dinner in overated restaurants and hanging at the pool where the view is great. We were unlucky because it was raining all day long and could not hang at the pool much, I think the hotel staff could do a lote more to make the guests comfortable at the pool when it's raining, they have 3 Jacuzzis but most of them had cold water, and we didn't even have a covered space to…",4,
"This is an amazing structure conveniently located with beautiful views. Spacious rooms with the right sense of luxury and all facilities provided.  There are plenty of dining options to choose from, so were happy to explore. Convenience of shopping too is available without having to travel around. A few minor drawbacks in service, but could certainly turn a blind eye owing to the busy period. The place itself compliments and covers many positives. Good for a short stay in Singapore, but will have to consider the steep price.",4,
"It was an amazing experience of staying at Marina Bay Sands. Despite an extremely long flight to Singapore, endless queue for check-in, crowds of people - this hotel is totally unique! Just imagine living in a skyscraper or in a tower, as it is named. Absolutely stunning view is opened from the top. Sky infinity pool is worth the price you pay. Honestly, my trip there became one of the brightest memories I have today.",5,
"A big, very, big, enormous, no, really big hotel with all the impersonality that implies. However, amazing building, great location, easy to reach, close to what’s left of the old town and that pool, high, jaw-dropping but windy and very, very, very cold!  Rooms fine, lots of space so a pity toilet in bathroom and no tub. Checkin a bit slow. Dining options a bit bland.",5,
"Overall, this place does live up to most expectations. It’s a stunning building with  breathtaking views and just about every amenity you could possibly need. Service is exemplary and the staff are smart, friendly and approachable.  My room was large with a deep bathtub and wet room combo, and all the facilities you could need including a kettle. It may be a little daunting for anyone with vertigo since the rooms are reached via internal walkways rather than corridors but at least you can admire the architecture! The place is stuffed full of large-scale artworks and it’s light and airy. There are a few “buts” although minor... the reception space is a little underwhelming and could be a bottleneck on busy times - I was there when it was relatively quiet... and it felt a little…",5,
"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore for just one night, but it was absolutely amazing to experience. Their Infinity Pool on the top is insane and the view over DownTown from up there is unlike any other thing. Nice roomservice and restaurant too. Go there! High price range but worth it. Bonus: David Beckham has also stayed here multiple times. ",5,
"Fantastic location - in Marina Bayand close to Bay of Gardens, Marina Bay, shops, restaurants, short trip to Sentosa and 20 minutes to the airport. Hotel was extremely big - around 2500 rooms which was way to big for my liking. Check in time took over 10-15 minutes which is the longest check in I have ever experienced and considering all information and payment was made in full prior to going. The check in counter was very long and each person was appearing to be taking the same time to check in. Check out however was much quicker. The affinity pool area was way too busy for our liking and didn't even use the area. We had a room on level 12 and it required 3 elevators to get to level 57 where the pool was which was a huge inconvenience and also why we didn't use the affinity…",3,
"Second time there.  It is still a awesome place.  But ... the light over the desk needs to be repaired, next to the mirror I found black stains, the electricity went down for a good hour in the room, the room is not available before 3pm and you have to leave at 11 am even when your flight is not before 11pm.  So sadly, with so many other awesome hotels around, one shall save some money and go somewhere else.  I‘m afraid to say so. ",4,
"We've visited Singapore several times. This time we decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands. Excellent choice! Our room in the 40+ floor had a breathtaking view of the city line. We bought a package the hotel offered with the Grand Club Room, access to the Club 55, the Infinity Pool and more. From the time we walked in we felt great. The reception very professional and friendly both when we checked-in and out, the breakfast rich and plenty, the snacks and tea-time on the club floor excellent in quality and view, the concierge service efficient. We'll be back next time.",5,
This is club room and big enough for my child to run everywhere. The city view very nice and can see Merlion Park very well.The club 55 service is so sweet and I can enjoy breakfast with my family every morning. The boundless swimming pool view also very special and my family are very impressive it. We enjoy Singapore tour and will come again .,5,
"Marina Bay Sands is probably Singapore's landmark these days.The hotel is an extraordinary building and dominates the surrounding area.  We stayed in a family room which was amazing! Large king bed, 2 single beds, with kitchenette, balcony, sitting area, 2 toilets and a very large bathroom. It was more like a studio.  The infinity pool is to die for. Although crowded and sometimes annoying as nearly everyone is trying to take photos,(even in the pool), it's still the hotel's major draw card.The best times to go is early morning to take in the sun rise and also at night to see the gorgeous city lights. You don't have to leave this place as it has everything and some people have complained about that but not us! Some superb restaurants, high end shopping, casino, but also a…",5,
"Wow, is your first reaction when you walk into the Marina Bay Sands.  We arrived around 10:45 am with our luggage intending to leave the stored until check in time at 3:00 pm.  When I inquired about this I was told to line up at the check in counter as from 11:00 am, if there is a room available you will be directed to that room which we did, we were in the room at 11:15 with our luggage a couple of minutes behind us. The room (Deluxe King Suite with City View) was large with a complete wall comprising of a floor to ceiling window overlooking the museum, shopping center and the nightly light show. The large room made the the King Size bed look like a double the Bathroom/Shower/Toilet are was extremely large.  All in all a great experience with absolutely nothing to complain about",4,
"It was really great experience stay in marina bay sands, since they have a lot of rooms we have a bit long queue when did the check in but they serve you a water and even ice cream while you are queuing, so it doesn't a big deal to wait, it was a really nice and unique welcome treat..  We stayed in the premiere garden view, nice view to garden by the bay, the room was very spacious and the bathroom as well.. As you know the infinity pool was amazing and lucky that time we don't have a lot of people swim there, maybe because it was raining.. But you can only access the pool with your room key, one person per key, that's great so only the in house guest can enjoy the pool..  Also you can get the benefit when you are stay here, like discount for some outlet and even the sampan ride…",5,
"What a place and what a view!  We knew from day one of our Singapore holiday planning that we were going to stay there. The infinity pool, the tall towers - its altogether different. We met people from other high rank hotels coming over just for that scintillating rooftop pool experience.  Our check-in process was smooth, didn't have to wait in the queue and got escorted to inside room and the process was over within 10 minutes. From there, we enjoyed the delux king skyview and realised how much that differs from a standard delux king room, you are basically almost at the top few levels of the hotel. With open of the door to your room, the curtains on the opposite side of floor to ceiling glass window automatically pulls out - just experiences you can't describe in words.  We…",5,
Went here with family . The hotel rooms although clean are basic but the swimming pool on the roof is exceptional. Sitting in the pool of an evening watching the light show over Marina Bay has to be experienced . ,5,
"Having viewed Marina Bay Sands on a television show many months ago I knew instantly I had to stay there.   Staying in Singapore for 3 days in total (2 in a different hotel) the suspense was killing me for when I could finally check in.   As we arrived, I could not believe how busy the lobby area was. People everywhere and not only guests.   The room itself was very spacious but didn't have that wow factor I was hoping for.   We couldn't wait to head to the roof and use what we had been waiting for.. the pool. To our disappointment the water was freezing!! After a few selfies we retired to the sun loungers. Relaxing atmosphere minus the non-guests huddled in an area (your not allowed in the pool area unless your a guest) overlooking the pool making you feel as if your an…",3,
"Loved to stay in this hotel, from the check in Glen was very helpful, let us have an early check in like 11am so thats a bonus !!! kids are very excited to see the pool, the room was spectacular although you have to pay for the extra bed :( but that doesnt spoil our stay!! the view of the room was spectacular - the gardens by the bay. I was surprised for the complimentary cake i had, that makes me special and it was delicious!  The pool!! well the view was amazing we did make the most of our stay in the pool day and night and everything was worth it! Recommended for everyone!!",5,
"Pros: beautiful hotel, great room, cool pool but the pictures make it look way better then what it is. A lot of good restaurants mostly celebrity chefs from western country's but their food court has so awesome authentic food.   Cons: Room rate $575 a night this hotel is not worth the rate at all it's not a 5 star hotel. Service is horrible, the hotel is completely understaffed. Checking in I had to stand in line for 45 min. This actually blows my mind for the rate I am paying I had to waste 45 min of my time waiting in a line to check in. It felt like I was waiting to go through security at the airport. Pool service horrible to 1 hr to order a drink and another 20 min to receive the drink and it cost $28. Location is terrible your removed from al the great areas. Metro takes…",3,
"Stayed this month, was shocked at how overcrowded this hotel actually was... All of the photos online paint a nice picture of a breezy/chilled hotel and rooftop pool, this couldn’t be further from the truth, you cannot move in the lobby, pool or anywhere for that matter, people really are rammed into this place! The elevators in the hotel demonstrate how busy the hotel is, we were on the 42nd floor... To get down to the lobby it took us on average 5 minutes plus due to the amount of times it had to stop! This may seem not long at all, but when you’re in a stuffy lift packed full of people, it is!  The room was clean, nicely furnished and had a good size bathroom, although we found the mattress very firm.  Good points were the views from the roof top and Club 55 for drinks and…",2,
Stunning hotel and the pool experience is unreal. If you saw the tv programme on the property you can start to appreciate what goes into this behind the scenes.  The staff and the facilities are excellent and how the whole thing is efficiently controlled by computers shows that it can be done even in a hotel of thisnsize and complexity.  Having done this I would probably stay in the Fullerton next time for the peace as MBS can be manic once you exit the lift to the lobby or pool deck.,5,
We stayed in a Deluxe City view room for the first part of our honeymoon. The room had a great view of the city (we were on the 19th floor).   The room was very clean and housekeeping was very efficient. The facilities were also really nice. The location was great as it was so close to the gardens by the bay and was above an MRT ration which was very convenient.  We found the hotel a little too big and impersonal but this is probably just our taste. The sky deck and infinity pool were always very busy with lots of people reserving lounges and then not using them so it was hard to get a pool lounge. It was definitely a fantastic experience but I don’t think we would stay there again.,4,
"Fab hotel just look at the web site. Rooms very large, noisy on the garden side construction going on. But close the patio doors and silent and the ac comes on.Breakfast huge choise all buffet. Hot hood is luke warm. Infinty pool to die for. Lifts very confusing. Great gardens along side all lit up at night.Fantastic free light and water show every night",4,
"Stayed in the hotel in January 2018. We checked in at 3:30AM due to flight delays, and the personnel were incredibly helpful in helping us settle in knowing we were exhausted. The views from the infinity pool was as breathtaking as you could expect -- having full skyview of the city. Even our room had great views of the city. After checking out, the hotel allowed for us to come back in the evening, pick up our luggage and have a shower at the gym before catching our late evening flight out of Singapore.",5,
"We arrived early from a long haul flight, room not ready which was expected, however there is no reception area for guest to sit and wait. That evening we wanted a cocktail at the main bar on the 57th floor, queues to get in so we flagged it. There were many empty tables but we we told these were ""booked"", however we were then told by reception that you could not book tables!! Breakfast on the 57th fllor was much the same, a 20min queue then told ""we close in 10 min, so eat quick or you can take some food away!!""  Pool on 57th floor is very cool photo shop opportunity, but cold enough to freeze the balls off a polar bear!!",2,
"This is an extremely large resort, casino and convention hotel property.  Service is outstanding but most Singapore hotel service are outstanding, amenities are also exceptional, including the views and pool deck.  However, since I was there for business meeting, I found this luxury property to be somewhat overwhelming and unusable due to my schedule. However, I would highly recommend this property if you're primary in Singapore for leisure versus business.  Believe the whole family could relax and enjoy the many amenities here.",5,
Arriving into Singapore after a 12 hour flight we checked into what was supposed to be a welcome last break before my partner gave birth to our child. As we entered the room we were greeted by the sound of repetitive drilling and thumping. Staying on the 46th floor in a king suite you would think this would not affect you yet it was akin to staying on site with the builders. After no sleep from flying we could now not rest in the room that we had paid an extortionate amount of money for and had to now go elsewhere and pay money to be outside of our room that I mentioned we had already bled money for. Not the best start to a four night stay.   Day two we were awoken to none other than the same construction sounds at 8am therefore forcing us out of bed early and out of the hotel…,1,
"The people from Singapore and the staff are what makes this hotel stand out more than the massive pool on the roof. Sure the pool is amazing, but that only impresses for the first day while staying at this massive hotel. Every day the staff made our stay better. We also stayed at the Ritz down the street later in our trip. The Ritz is a much nicer hotel but the staff at the Marina Bay was much better. The hotel really does not fit this city/state. Singapore is very classy and the skyline is phenomenal. This hotel looks so awkward and gaudy. Las Vegas with its silly pyramid, fake NY skyline, and castle looks so cheap. Lets hope that Singapore does not add anymore Vegas to a classy place. I couldn't give anything less than four stars because the staff is world class and it is…",4,
"Check in I understand can be a lengthy process but for us it was fine.  However, the long queues for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner are a bit much, although the staff are very efficient at placating queuing clients.  It is an iconic hotel, the pool was full of people just taking selfies, not even enough room to swim.  I get it though, people want a picture at the most iconic hotel in the world, however there was no way I was getting in the pool, there was definitely an infection or something waiting to be had!  I stayed, I've done it but it is completely soul less, sterile and nothing personal or special about the stay. It really is like one of the large vegas hotels catering to the masses.  Stay but honestly don't expect 5* treatment.",4,
"It's a good hotel, but very crowded, long ques with check-in/check-out, but luckily we checked in and checked out pretty fast.   We were on the 15th floor in tower 3 with a view to the Gardens by the bay and stayed 3 nights. The room was ok, but we had some problems with the power, always switches on and off no matter if the key card was stick into the power switch. They fixed the problem on the second day.   The last day there was some heavy rain in the morning and when we leaved our room there was some water in the hallway and smells like mold. They cleaned it by the end of the day.   The pool is nice place with a great view, but it's not easy to find a sunbed, especially if you are with friends. It's very very crowded even in the night.  The Concierge service is great, you…",4,
I recently visited Singapore for two days stayed in this hotel  It’s mega hotel with 2600 rooms excellently managed  The bed was clean comfortable .  The hotel is nicely maintained in spite of its large structure  The rooms are big as compared to other hotels in Singapore  The room lacked one thing that is bath tub  ,5,
Of course this hotel is gorgeous. The pool is fantastic. My only complaint is that it was very cold. I would expect when I’m paying $500 a night to be able to enjoy the pool without freezing. It was a great disappointment. The jacuzzi was warm but not hot. They should be beating the pool and turn up the heat in the jacuzzi. I was also disappointed in that. The staff was kind and accommodating. Everything in this hotel is very very expensive. Be prepared to pay $150-$200 per meal. ,4,
I booked there just one night. I looked view from my room is so beautiful cuz you can see around the sea and if you swimming in the rooftop like heaven.rooftop swimming poor you can see Sin it's top view. i really like it.,5,
"Long wait times for check in. Long wait times to use the lifts and takes ages to get to the intended level. This is extremely annoying, when it does arrive it also stops at about 5 other levels. Infinity pool at night boasts amazing views. Would not recommend staying here except for the use of the pool for the spectacular views and gimmicky infinity pool experience. ",3,
"As one of the most iconic hotels in the world with the highest and largest infinity pool ever, we had to try the Marina Bay Sands on a recent visit, and we really enjoyed ourselves. We arrived about 9am and Peggy at the front desk who was incredibly friendly and helpful got us a room a few hours earlier than check in time. We were in room 1917 which overlooks gardens by the bay in Tower 3. Very nice deluxe room with a king size bed and all the regular amenities you'd expect from a 5 star hotel.   We told Peggy it was our honeymoon and later in the day they sent up a nice piece of chocolate cake with a little note that said congratulations. Much appreciated.   The hotel/shopping mall is just absolutely massive, but fairly easy to navigate. If you're in Singapore and want to…",5,
I’ve stayed in a good few five stars in my time and often find them a bit of a let down. This place is probably the most iconic but it’s got a good few downsides  a) just too big which results in a lack of personal service; you begin to feel like a walking gold card rather than a person. The poor staff are overworked and tend to be a bit robotic.  B) related to a) the staffs hands are tied with regard to helping bend rules of any type (like extending checkout by a couple of hours)  C) it looks great on the outside but the room design is very “American casino) it’s definitely not got the euro / modernist style - there’s a lot of patterned carpet and marble.  D) plants on balcony areas are a bit lacklustre.  E) there’s no guest lounge or areas to just sit and get away from all the…,3,
"Like most we thought let’s stay at one of the most iconic hotels so we can use the amazing pool! Complete waste of money! Ok the room was nice but I’ve stayed in better for less money. Pool was a disgrace! Cheap white towels everywhere that people had left on loungers and you didn’t know if they were in the pool or had gone, no one cleaning up, food everywhere! No padding on the loungers. Eventually found 2 together, get in the pool and it was freezing! Why does a hotel of this size and that costs so much no heat the pool? I really don’t know how people were in it, we were so disappointed. Didn’t go again! Wish we had stayed somewhere else to be honest! If your going for the pool don’t bother!",2,
"We arrived MBS during the busiest time of the year. Hotel was full and lines to check-in longer than at the airport, service rather poor. Rooms are great for couples, but I can not recommend the hotel for families travelling with small children. The hotel complex is huge, ’soulless’ and does not take into account small travellers. Next time in Singapore, our family will choose another hotel. View from the pool is great 🤩",3,

"Had to try out the rooftop pool! Requested  early checking in a phone conversation the day before. Staff said they would try. Upon arrival, was told to come back at 6 am. At 6 am no room ready???  Took my information and stated I would be contacted. Was given card to use rooftop pool. Then I went to the downstairs Rise breakfast buffet. Overpriced at about 50 dollars, but a good selection of breakfast items.  Went back to checkin desk, waited in line, found room was ready and I had never been notified. From what I observed, expect a line at check in, early checkin, don't count on it, staff could care less.  The main attraction for this property other than the Casino, is the rooftop pool. It is very nice, well staffed and has an adult only section as there were lots of families…",3,
A different place from all other in the world. We though the rooms were going to be noisy because of the huge hall but we were surprised because it was actually very cosy.  The infinity pool gives an extraordinary view on the Singapore city.  ,5,
"I would give 3.5 points. We had a club room which includes the breakfast, tea time and from 5 p.m to 7p.m snacks and drinks on the 55 th floor. Breakfast is very good the choice from different products and you find everything you need. Tea time is like tea time shoud be. The lounge time is a bit busy there are many people who want to use this and the restaurant is full so sometimes you have to wait till you get a table wich i don’t liked. To many people and children running around the restaurant it’s a bit sad for a good hotel we definitely had better lounges. Staff tries to help you with everything they do a really great job! Very friendly! It’s a great hotel with nice rooms and the wonderful infinity pool on top! Don’t miss the whirlpool also on the 57 th floor:) You will need…",3,

"The hotel special architecture of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel makes it one of the most impressive sights in Singapore. You can get here easily via Taxi or MRT. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. We had a wonderful view overseeing the Gardens by the Bay and could watch the light show comfortably even though it was raining. Of course, the pool and Sky Bar are worth visiting, too (even though I was surprised that the Singapore Sling is not served at the Ce La Vi, but only as a room service item).  The Shoppes at the Marina Bay Sands are a short walk away and offer a diverse food court with excellent choices (including vegetarian) and several cafes for those who don't want to spend 50$ for a meal.

"Having had remarkably high hopes for staying at an iconic global hotel, Marina Bay Sands served up the worst hotel experience of my lifetime. Having visited Singapore a number of times; I have been to some of Singapore's best hotels; including the Ritz Carlton and the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The Marina Bay Sands is by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at; not just in Singapore, but globally. It is expensive and has terrible service; reflecting truly poor value. If you want to pay top dollar, and get treated like a number; this is the venue to visit.   The whole stay; end to end left nothing to be desired. The main check-in desk feels like waiting in line at an airline check-counter. Alternatively, if you book a ""club"" room, there is an alternative check-in lounge; where…",1,

"Stayed for three nights in a club room during January 2018. A lot of great things to be said for the hotel including the early check in, the room itself, the helpfulness of the Concierge team, Club 55 and the rooftop pool. Shame it was slightly let down by over pushy waitress in ‘Rise’ who struggled to take no for an answer as well as raising her eyebrows to colleagues when we turned down a second drink and food. ‘Drift’ on the other hand is the place to go. Great cocktails both on and off the menu!",4,
This hotel if within your budget is a must.   Not just because of the iconic nature of the building and to experience the infinity pool on the 57th floor.  The pool is only open to guests which gives it a nice exclusive feel.   Within the whole hotel every staff member is friendly and charming and well informed.   There are three towers and your checkin could be at one end of the building or the other but a staff member directed us to the correct checkin so no time was wasted in the wrong queue. Another great thing was after 17 hours of travelling and arriving at 10 am the reception staff checked us in early so we could shower and change and have a whole day sightseeing....other hotels even when they have vacancies are often not as generous..making you wait till the 3pm checkin…,5,
"I debated on whether or not to spend a night here on my trip to Singapore.  It would mean switching hotels, which is always a pain on vacation.  In the end, I really wanted to experience the pool and be on that roof. It was well worth it!  The building is so unique and amazing.  The room was also great....large room, big bathroom, nice shower, great views. The casino is pretty good as well, although they examine your passport very oddly to get in the casino and to get out of the casino.  I will assume that this is a Singapore thing, but its weird, annoying, and so odd for a country where you never, ever see police anywhere. The mall attached to the hotel is almost exclusively super fancy shops that are very expensive. The pool is the highlight and I spent most of my time up…",5,
Marina bay sands is a chaotic hotel that is not located in a great spot for touristy things to do. The lobby is huge spanning 3 towers with a lot of staff seemingly unable to assist the naieve traveller. Pay $20/ person to go to the roof. This includes a $20 credit for dood and beverage on the roof top bar. You can get a glimpse of the roof top pool... Only guests are permitted to go poolside. The pool seems average at best with deck chairs lying 3 deep. It's overcrowded and does not appear big enough to cater for a full house at the hotel. Better than going to the hotel is to see it at night from afar. It looks spectacular! Great spot to see it from is the lantern rooftop bar at the Fullerton bay hotel,3,
"Stayed for 4 nights in early January, not he first time I’ve been. It’s a beautiful complex, rooms are fantastic, pool is amazing and you can’t have a bad meal! You don’t even need to leave the resort, everything is there. My complaint is that I have paid for the room and my stay in full and I am still waiting ( now 8 days ) for them to release funds back to my card. Essentially they double charged me by taking the bond + room charge from my card on check in and on check out - instead of just charging me the additional expenses incurred during my stay they CHARGED ME THE ROOM, BOND AND EXPENSES again. So instead of a bill of $3,000 ... I am stuck with a bill of $6,000. It’s taken me 3 phone calls, 4 emails and I still haven’t got my money back nor an apology. It leaves a sour…",1,

It was the top of our to do list, and didn’t care that we had to splurge and break the budget to stay here....it was bloody amazing!!!!  You can walk in to certain 4-5 star hotels and not really feel that you pay for what you get, but with all the cleanliness and styles of the room, plus the infinity pool, plus all the restaurants and shoppes, it makes the hotel so luxurious.   Check in time was QUICK! We booked in for the premier room and ended up fast tracking over to the VIP line because it was banking up, which shows that they’re productive in getting their guests checked in on time and don’t like to keep anyone waiting. The women who checked us in was warm with her greeting and a woman on a mission. In a…",5,

"I have visited this stunning hotel before on a trip to Singapore, and dreamed about coming back here to stay one day, a definite one on my bucket list, swimming in that incredible infinity pool. This isn’t a hotel that most can afford, it is a splurge to say the least. I booked a club room, a bit more, but it came with added benefits, a higher floor and use of the club 55 for breakfast and happy hour. Unfortunately, our flight was delayed, and it was pouring rain when we got to the hotel, so no happy hour, and because of the rain and lightening, no pool visit on our first night. We booked a reservation at the much talked about dessert buffet at club 55, which I have to say was a disappointment. Not as amazing as i heard , and very pricey for what it was. I’ll back up to us first…",4,

"Staying here is an experience. We had 3 nights on the 45th floor in Tower 3.  Excellent rooms with a great view over the bay.  The pool on top needs no further explanation, a great experience (if a little busy at times).  Bar is expensive but then so is the rest of Singapore for a Brit at the moment !",5,
"It was one of my dream to stay in this iconic hotel. The views from the rooms and the hotel top floor is splendid and provides you Wow experience. It is expensive of course but the experience you get is worth it.  The check-in was pretty quick, since i was expecting a delay. I got a Garden view room and it was very good and neat. The breakfast and evening snacks at Club 55 was very nice and provided a great view as well.  Check out was little delayed but was fine. The location of the hotel is fantastic and provides easy access to cabs as well as MRT.  The only issue faced was that there were too many guests everywhere. The club lounge as well the infinity pool was full of people always.",4,

Sky desk & sky bar are both worth for going no matter in the day time or the night (make sure you wear some jackets) with the winds are quite big.   the infinitive pool definitly worth for gettin up early (7am)for taking photos or relaxing.  make sure you bring an sunglasses with you with such a high building pool :)   the counter was very nice and gave us a free upgrade to the sea view bedroom.  the staff was nice and specially the guards from the sky desk no matter where you go make sure you bring your room key.   after all, is a stay i'll never forget.   *all pool,skybar, sky desk access is on Tower 3  (if you are living in Tower 2 or tower 1, its…",5,
If you can afford to stay it’s worth doing so for a night or two. The views from the pool and the room are breath-taking and totally worth it.   Keep in mind that it’s very busy/crowded hotel though so you might not get the full 5-star experience you might be expecting (especially when it comes to breakfast near the pool). ,5,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 days before we went back to manila.   the rooms overlooked the Gardens by the bay.   our balcony gave us a really nice view of some of the attractions, especially at nite.  the rooms were so spacious and nicely maintained on a daily basis.   the buffet was a bit expensive but gave us a lot of selections.  the infinity pool on the top deck is worth the visit.  great overall experience with the check in and check out with the front desk staff.",5,
"This is one of our favourite hotels in the world. The rooftop pool club is the outstanding feature. The large room set up, bed quality, bathrooms and amenities all excellent. As the name suggests, it sits atop the Marina Bay Area, overlooking the city of Singapore.   Make sure you visit Spago's restaurant while you are there. ",5,
"Stayed at the MBS for 2 nights with my husband to celebrate his 40th birthday.  Upon arrival, we were able to do the fast VIP check in because we filled out an arrival form the hotel sent us via email.  Recommend that you do this as the check in line at 2pm was ridiculously long.    The room was nice and we had a view of the bay and the Merlion fountain.  I also enjoyed a long workout at the banyan tree gym on the 55th floor.  I wanted to get a massage but the treatments are so over priced, I decided to pass and just wait till I got back to Los Angeles.    The perk of staying at the hotel is access to the skypark pool.  It is an incredible experience to be 57 stories up and able to swim to the edge.  Great for those Instagram photos.   As we were celebrating my husbands…",4,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night before joining a cruise. the check in procedure was flawless and we were given drinks and ice creams while we waited.  It is not cheap but what an experience, we had a view of the city and were located on the floor 37 in tower three . The pool is located on the top of the buildings is out of this world, it wasn’t busy and the views were breath taking of the city. We had a fantastic breakfast in the restaurant in the pool area . Would I stay again? – yes in a heart beat !!",5,
Since you have to be a guest of the hotel in order to access the pool we stayed for one night. Our room was wonderful with a great view of the Gardens By The Bay which lit up beautifully during the evening.  The staff were so polite and professional. I'm looking forward to going back.,5,
"Marina Bay Sands nails it! Their level of excellence is everything you’d wish for and don’t often get! Although large, MBS will make you feel like an important guest! Rooms, shops, restaurants are all fabulous!",5,
"We stayed there as two couples and weren't aware that they only issue two room keys and thus only two can enter the pool at any given time. Without question the main attraction is the pool as the food is good but not incredible and the drinks are overpriced. We did the buffet breakfast and it was $110 for two! Ludicrous.   Now for the good bit. The view from the pool is spectacular, and worth every penny. We only stayed one night and it cost us $475 per couple ($900)! But it was worth it for the pool. The view is incredible and the pool was not overcrowded which I guess is why they have the restrictions they do. Takes a long time to get up and down the elevators. The fact that it's close to the gardens and the shoppes is excellent!   Overall I'd recommend it, but be prepared for…",4,
"Great location; very clean and huge room that beyond our expectations ; tasty breakfast with a lot of dishes to choose, We really enjoy the infinity pool . our stay in this hotel, was memorable . thank you!  ",5,
"This is a big, quite new and tall hotel with very many guests who all fill the huge lobby - the whole ground floor so to speak - and it's a frenzy on the floor without its like. But, everything works with mastery precision thanks to the incredibly skilled staff. There is always someone to ask. When you check in: Probably you enter via the first tower where check-in takes place. If you do not have a voucher, go straight to VIP and they will take care of you immediately (ie not where there are queues similar to airports). You live in one of the three towers, and if you have a floor plan over the 40th, the view is amazing. Lovely large and luxurious rooms with comfortable beds and bathrooms, with all the service and amenities you can possibly need to get the most out of your stay.…",5,
"The basic rooms here cost on average, US$350 per night which is INSANE! The rooms were very very basic and seemed like the rooms you would find at a Holiday Inn (In Singapore) where you can pay less than US$200 a night for. You can even stay at Four Seasons or the Mandarin Oriental for about the same price! The difference? THEIR ROOMS ARE ACTUALLY NICE!  Anyways, the Infinity Pool is amazing and gives you a nice view of Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands shopping centre was huge and beautiful, but had NO seats (they want you to keep moving). I also really liked how the Bayfront MRT (Downtown & Circle Lines) is connected to this property and it is very convenient.",3,
"Hands down, this is the best place to stay in Singapore! My family had booked a room here to stay for our vacation and the view of the harbor view was amazing. The infinity pool is amazing as well but you have to get there early to get a lounge chair. The staff is extremely helpful. The entire property is fantastic. I would surely recommend this if you are ready to spend a quite a few S$.",5,
"This hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels we have stayed in. Room service was delicious and you get big portions, entertainment on tv was great if you wanted a relaxed night in. The pool is incredible, the view is worth every cent however it could be heated as it does get a bit chilly. The outdoor spas also have fantastic views aswell. The shopping mall with more restaurants is right under the resort and the gardens by the bay is right next to the hotel. Everything is so central to this hotel you don’t need to venture far. A cab to orchard road only cost us $12. This hotel is expensive but for most people it is a once in a lifetime opportunity but we will be planning a long weekend getaway here soon. ",5,
"We booked this hotel for our one night stay, mainly for the infinity pool. We arrived earlier than check in time and the staff were very helpful in storing our luggage, and giving us temporary cards so that we could access the fitness area for changing facilities and the infinity pool. As expected the infinity pool did not disappoint with the views over the city, but we did find the pool awfully cold and unpleasant to stay in, both during the afternoon and the following morning. We received a text once the hotel rooms were ready, and were informed that instead of having 2 double rooms we were being given a suite so we would be all together. This was a surprising upgrade and a hotel room which we will never forget, it was a shame that we were only there for one night! The suite…",5,
"This hotel is a landmark of Singapore and definitely worth a stay. The architecture is amazing and the pool area must be one of the most spectacular ones in the world. The rooms are very nice of course and the sea and downtown view fabulous! But - the hotel is huge so there is a long line to check in, there is a long line for breakfast, the pool area is crowded, it’s almost impossible to have dinner at the hotel without reservations and I was really surprised there was no turn down service, which is normally standard in 5-star hotels. So, amazing in many ways but don’t expect that ’extra exclusive luxury hotel feeling’.",4,
"Ok its not bad,but i think they have to do somethiing about the stay at the infinity pool so overcrowded so it was crazy,no sunchairs available and even it was almost raining and very cloudly,there was 3-4 persons sitting on every sunchair ,and there was also lots of empty ones with only a towel or a book that ppl had reserved all day without staying there,but i think this is the only reason ppl stay here,for the swimmingpool,i paid $600 and couldnt have 1 minute in a chair there, took some pictures and now done  that,maybe they have to maximize the stay for ppl there like max 2-3 hours so every one can enjoy,the hotel is also little bit far from city 30 minutes walk,the minibar prices omygod $14 for a small 33cl lokal Tiger beer what they think about roomservices it should not…",3,
"Wow, an incredible experience to stay here.The hotel represents modern Singapore. It is a city within a city, the close proximity of the F1 circuit makes a perfect location.All the major attractions of Singapore are within easy reach. The views are stunning.Our room on the 48th floor faced the city so the views at night of Fullerton Hotel,The Merlion and other famous buildings were fabulous. At night it looked like a live photo, just awesome.Looking down felt like a dream of colourful lights and very surreal.The room itself was very modern with state of the art facilities.The hotel made it special by providing a huge basket of fruit and a birthday cake.We were treated like VIPS.Our room included afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Absolutely scrumptious and brilliant as we…",5,
"Having booked this hotel to access the infinity pool we were excited and looking forward to our stay. We arrived early to the hotel hoping to drop our bags, after negotiating long queues and waiting about we finally got to the check in desk and were very pleased to get an early check in. Boost! We had a room in tower 3 19th floor with garden views, fantastic views. The room was clean and presentable however wasn't particularly special. We headed for lunch at Spargo and were met with queues again, after queuing the meal was nice enough. We then headed to the infinity pool where your met with military precision security checks, for obvious reasons to prevent use of the pool, although some guests struggled with the gates they were met with abrupt staff. The views and the use of the…",4,
"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. I had a bayfront room, which was well furnished, large and comfortable - apart from the view. The world-famous swimming pool is very nice, although the water was cold.  Moreover, as you may know, the whole complex is really good - nightclubs, rooftop restaurant, mall, casino, etc. On the other hand, there's a line for everything - check-in, check-out, taxi, lifts, restaurants, etc., and that's not what we expect when we spend the high fares they charge.  If you like big crowds and fuss, the hotel is ok. However, if you like a more personal treatment, go the Mandarim Oriental or Fullerton accross the bay (for the same price).",4,
"Visiting this hotel has been on my bucket list for a while and it did not disappoint. We had no expectations of the room as the infinity pool was our main reason for staying. We were located on the 7th floor and we had views of the Garden by the Bay. This place is luxurious and the staff very attentive. Largest hotel room by far we have ever stayed in with its own balcony. One minor complaint would be that the bed was firmer than we would have liked. I’m sure if we had requested a mattress topper, one would have been provided but as we only stayed for two nights we didn’t want to make a fuss. The infinity pool did not disappoint but it does get very crowded during the day. I made the effort to get there at 6am and enjoyed the peace and sunrise by myself. The security to enter…",5,
"Even though the hotel is  big - service is very nice ! the roof pool is stunning - better then you expect. rooms are very nice - big ! we select the one with garden and bay view on the 45th floor and the view was stunning , you can see the garden night show just from balcony ! Definitely stay there , even if you are for 1 night!",5,
"We were in Singapore on our honeymoon and treated ourselves to a stay in the Marina Bays Sands hotel.  Expectations were high for our stay in this iconic hotel, but we were left bitterly disappointed.  We got out of our taxi from the airport and there was no one available to help with bags.  This area is very busy and frantic.  You arrive exhausted from travelling to a space you can barely think in.  When we eventually got someone to help with bags he directed us to the check-in desk.  We had booked at Club level and had an idea there was a separate check-in area, when I asked this he said no and pointed at the long check-in queue.  Luckily as we joined this queue I spotted the Sands Lounge which is the separate check-in area.  This is a much more chilled out area with…",1,
"We stayed here for two nights in December en route back from Thailand. We stayed in one of the Orchid Suites on level 54 which was amazing in terms of size, facilities and of course views. The staff were all lovely and very attentive and we were able to enjoy the executive lounge as part of the suite privileges. The variety of food and beverage options available was staggering and all were good. The sheer scale of the hotel (2,500 rooms) does not create the intimacy of a usual luxury hotel stay but definitely an experience to be savoured!",5,
"We stayed here on the last leg of our journey & it really didn’t disappoint. The hotel is absolutely huge & very busy however staff made you feel welcome & were available at all times. Our room was fantastic, the views amazing overlooking the Gardens by the Bay it was truly fabulous. We visited the rooftop pool & even though the weather was very smoggy, it was amazing being up there in the pool looking across the skyline. The only issues were that it was very busy & the food was expensive for what it was (£60 for two sandwiches & two cokes) but the experience made it worthy of this. We have visited many beautiful hotels around the world & this one was in our top three. A wonderful visit to a beautiful city. ",5,
Now MBS has become my favourite and preferred hotel for stay in Singapore. This time I was provided with city view room which was also equally good. We were able to watch the laser show (sound and light) from the lift lobby. Great experience again and again.,5,
"Our overall experience was below average, compared to the price paid. with the exception of the views and pool, it’s a poor 5* hotel.  Positives: spacious rooms with a great view of the bay The view is main selling point…it’s enough to use the viewing deck instead of spending a night there. Nice pool (the infinity pool) but not very clean and overcrowded; the walls of the pool are slimy… Negatives: Check in at tower 3, no staff to show or direct guests to the reception, no trolley or help. Slow check in, same person checking in, is the same receiving your luggage, took long to get the luggage in the room Although the room was an upgrade (delux with skyline view) there was no bathtub!  Very long queues to almost everywhere including breakfast, that’s quite tiring.  Stuffy…",2,
"Stay here only for the view from the top every morning and night. It's very touristy at any time of the year. The infinity pool is always filled with people.  Try going in the afternoon or early in the morning to get some space in the pool to relax. If you want to be pampered in MBS, forget it. I don't really recommend staying here. ",3,
"Family trip with two rooms in Tower 3 on the 45th floor. Loved the Infinity Pool and jazz music played. Glad they had the kiddie section away from the main section to enjoy the pool and lounge chairs. Loved the connecting shopping mall with all of the high end stores. Save room for sweets at the Sweet Tooth Shop, which is located at Tower 3 entrance. When awaiting for tours pickup, make sure you are standing at the right location. There are three pick-up locations and we stood at the wrong area for our transfer back to the airport. Glad our guide found us. Loved the art museum, fireworks, water show, excellent service, and all. Loved our Singapore stay. 😎",5,
Marina Bay Sands has become a destination in it's own. the only down side of staying here is the fact thet you won't want to stay anywhere else if you ever return and I recommend staying here if you have really already done all the touristy stuff so you can just lap up the hotel and not be away from it all day.,5,
"This is one of the best hotel that I have ever stayed. The room are spacious and with very nice view. I suggest to go for City View instead of Garden View because you get to see all the lights from buildings from the room. Of course, the best of this hotel is the infinity skypool at level 57th. My favorite is the Jacuzzi.",5,
Spectacular views from the room and the roof top. The service by the staff at the hotel and the restaurants was excellent. Some great places to eat at the Shoppes next door. The Gardens by the bay is also a short walk. The lobby area however felt very crowded every time we walked into the hotel.,4,
"We had originally booked to stay at the Mandarin Oriental, but cancelled once an offer came up to stay here. As it was our honeymoon we were happy to spend more to make it extra special. We could only book in for 4 nights as it was Singapore National Day and rooms were full on the 5th day so we booked the W hotel for 9th August.   Upon check in we were stung with an addition 20% tax which brought our nightly stay cost to  We had booked this room on Booking.com and were not given any option to request views. I emailed the hotel promptly to request a city view and explained the situation on Booking.com - to which they responded with they would try their best to accommodate this.  As we had arrived early from the Maldives, there was not many rooms available. As we had booked a Club…",1,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on the last night of our 3 night stay in Singapore.  Being honest, for the price we paid (£500/night), I think the rooms are bang average and have no ""wow factor"" at all. Hence the rating.   The infinity pool, restaurants, shopping centres are all amazing but I just think for the price we paid it was missing that ""wow"" factor.  There is nothing wrong with the rooms, they are spacious and are clean, it just wasn't special.  We stayed at another hotel for the other 2 nights which was a fraction of the price and comparing rooms, the other outclassed Marina Bay by a mile.   Overall I would say it wasn't value for money considering the price we paid however if you got it cheaper I would say it is definitely worth it. ",3,
"Our family stayed a couple of nights at MBS during mid December and the decision turned out to be absolutely correct. It is a must stay hotel for first timers to Singapore like us.  We picked one night facing Gardens by the Bay and the next night with a Skyview room facing the City. Check in was great and had a lucky complimentary upgrade to junior suite the first night to the top floor (54) with a perfect view of the Harbour as well! The shower head in the suite is probably the most comfortable I've ever experienced.  MBS turned out to be everything that we saw in photos and more! The buildings actually look much bigger in front of your eyes than in photos, they are huge and I would regard MBS as a must visit tourist attraction itself.   The infinity pool and skydeck is free to…",5,
"Is you like no service, 20 minutes queue for breakfast at the executive club, 5 minutes wait for the elevators, noise and chaos for about 700 euro a night...then you will be in heaven.   If however you value personalized service,  or service at all in first place, efficient operations, a quiet and nice executive lounge with good food (the food was really not impressive) as it should be when paying almost 700 euro a night for a suite...then just stay away.  Yes the pool is amazing, yes the views are spectacular, but if you have to run in the morning to get a long chair at a noisy pool (Mallorca feeling in Singapore...) is really not worth such amounts of money.  The suite is ok, but again, totally overpriced for it is.   And once you check out (11am!) you’re not a guest anymore,…",3,
"Great service, pool was totally cool.  Had one of the best meals ever at Spago.  Can't say too much more but a totally awesome experience!  Stayed over New Years.  The service quality was excellent.  The food in most restaurants in Singapore is excellent and one of the reasons to visit there.  The location of the hotel next to the gardens is simply tremendous and the aquarium on Sentosa island is one of the best I have ever seen.  Clean, safe environment.",5,
"Must stay and see attraction in Singapore - the amazing Infinity pool !!! This magnificent hotel with several rooftop bars oh not to mention the worlds highest infinity pool is an absolute must visit.  Checking in was done easily even there was a long queue to check in, the process was efficient .   The rooms are huge, bathrooms very well equipped with a separate shower and toilet, and two sinks. With the city view rooms, the view was stunning, especially at night. Regarding the facilities the hotel is renowned for its infinity pool and we have spent hours in and by the pool. The view at night is something to behold and overall, the pool experience was unforgettable. Usually the pool area is somehow busy, but you can manage easily to  enjoy the stunning views over the Singapore.…",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for two nights and we really enjoyed our stay. Reception kindly checked us in early which was great after a long flight. Our room was very spacious had  a large bed, mini fridge, hairdryer and the floor to ceiling window faced out on Singapore Skyline which had spectacular views.  The food at the MBS was very expensive but I guess Singapore in general is quiet dear! We chose to grab food in the restaurants in the city instead. The rooftop infinity pool was amazing.. wasn't too busy which was great! Again the views up here were incredible and we got some lovely photos.   Overall we had a great stay and would definitely return  if we are in Singapore again",5,
" We stayed 4 nights at the Marina Bay sands. It is a beautiful hotel, but enormous. If you prefer smaller hotels this is not for you.  But I would recommend staying at least one night for the views, the pool and the chance to use the viewing platform on the top floor for free.  We stayed in a suite and the service was great, it also included breakfast in a special lounge only for club rooms and up. It seems the normal breakfast rooms are quite full in the mornings, we always saw long lines in front, so better to book a higher category if possible.  The restaurants at Marina Bay I cannot recommend for dinner, they are overpriced (140$) for dinner without alcohol and it wasn’t even good. Also the service was slow and inattentive. Better go to the shoppes and have dinner there.",4,
I recently spent close to a week here at the Marina Bay Sands as part of a convention.  The rooms are quite large and are well appointed.  Service is good throughout and is in line with what you would expect from a high end hotel in Singapore.  One thing to consider is where your room is.....our conference was in the convention center and I was in tower 3......so a ton of walking.,4,
"The best hotel !! Everything was perfect, very friendly staff and service.  Swimming pool is the best on planet with the best view.You can use swimming pool only with your room card and for that bring it with you always.Gym is nice with a lot of cardio machines.Try and Casino.  Thank you for amazing time 👌👌👌",5,
"We really enjoyed our time at Marina Bay Sands....specifically the Sky pool. I think it is a must do in Singapore. I will say that the service did not compare to the St regis Singapore, where we stayed the rest of the time. I would recommend this hotel for one night to experience the pool.",4,
"I had the pleasure of staying at the Marina Bay  Sands during the holiday season with my family. It was beautiful with all the festive decorations. Despite the long lines at the front desk, we didn't wait that long to be able to register and check in. The counter accomodates a lot of front office desk clerks and they all seemed to be on top of things going though the lines quite fast. There is a separate desk for check out, which makes the process a lot faster. The rooms were not ready so we headed over to the mall and returned in the afternoon to get our room keys. Our bags were already in our rooms by the time we returned. The hotel is very big with a few towers for hotel rooms, it is one of the most popular hotels in Singapore so this hotel  tends to be crowded and always…",5,

There are over 2,000 rooms plus thousands of visitors that come there each day for he shops and casino and gardens.  The service was still fantastic but if you’re not used to crowds steer clear!   All rooms have wonderful views and are nicely done (although not nicely enough for be money in my opinion).  Just be aware it takes a while to escape the property (think huge, Las Vegas scale) and he prices are OUTRAGEOUS.  You will pay $30 for a hamburger and $15 for a beer.  As with most of Singapore, you really should avoid this place is you are on a budget.    That being said, there is sooooo much to do here and…",4,

"We recently stayed for two nights at the MBS hotel and were REALLY disappointed with the standard of service. The hotel was unbelievably busy but we were told there was a good chance we’d get an early check-in after our night flight from Brisbane. Five hours later, we finally got into our room - at 1.15pm.... However, this was only because of the resourcefulness of the porter Madres as the receptionist had written the wrong room number on the key wallet! (He tried several of the neighbouring rooms and found we were actually staying in 3793 rather than 3794 suggesting this is perhaps a fairly regular occurrence).  Most annoying though was the fact they hadn’t set up a bed for my 15 year old son - despite us requesting this theee times during the course of the morning. Is this…",1,

"Family of four stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for three nights between Christmas and New Year.  We had a 'family room' which was on the second floor - we knew we would not have much of a view when we booked so that was fine.  However, windows and doors are not sound proof and you can hear the traffic outside all night long.    Room was very spacious & well presented although interesting to see how little details have been looked over - the sealing of tiles and joins is very patchy and would not pass in most five star hotels I've been in before.  Lifts seem to have no air-conditioning & were often (over) crowded.  Lobby very busy and the entire resort (including ""The Shoppes"" has a massive lack of room/chairs to simply sit down.    The pool deck was great to get a photo but the…",3,
Outstanding location in the heart of the city with beautiful Gardens by the bay behind it. Sky park and pool were breathtaking. This was our first visit to Singapore- completely worth it! Would not stay anywhere else. Service was exceptional everywhere. Recommend Club55 use if you are staying at the suites.,5,
"So for once I decided to book somewhere different for my stay in Singapore, the main attraction for booking here was the access to the pool.  Check in was easy, friendly welcoming staff. Room was clean well appointed and we had a pretty good view of gardens by the bay. Access to the pool was easy, and all pool staff we came into contact with were so friendly and helpful.  The only negative things I have to say about this property:  - The restaurant staff on Level 57 were pretty rude and surly, (so rude in fact that we decided to eat away from the property). - There was a massive line up for breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby which again steered us away from using the restaurant and we went off the property again to find food. - The line up for check out was crazy long…",4,
"It was just another tourist trap. So many Chinese and Koreans there. All women were having photo shooting sessions in the infinity pool. Some actually brought a potable lighting. Their boy friend or servant was following them to take photos all over the pool side. It was rather funny to look at. The pool was quite dirty, but expected with that much crowd in the water.  The room was good. Great view, but overall, I don't think I would come back to stay in this hotel.",3,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights in late December. Yep, it is an impressive structure: vast, lots of glass, glitz and one of a kind rooftop pool.   Service is pretty good too. But then you expect it to be for the price it costs to stay there.  Check in was exceptional as our room as not what we thought we had ordered but we were upgraded for free. Well that is what we were told. Special thanks to Grace who was fantastic on check in.   The cons are that it is so crowded and busy you feel like you’re in a major airport and this makes the experience very impersonal. The other drawback which was very inconvenient and annoying is that we had to carry our hotel security card ALL THE TIME.   To get into the pool, to use the pool loo, to leave the pool and so on.

The best hotel I have ever stayed at.  Close to cbd. Has train station to it. Shopping casino. Food is amazing but must book.  Roof top pool amazing.   By far the best place i have stayed bar none.

As my parents came visiting in the afternoon, I intend to bring them up to the roof top to explore.

As sophisticated as I could, I told the staff I will just wait at the lobby while my parents can have the access card to enter.  In the end, they only explore for less than 5 mins as no one can help them to take pictures.  Next, my kids decided to swim but I…",2,
"The middle pool, 70m in length, is a great venue for lap swimming.  However, one must show up right when it opens, at 6am, otherwise crowds start to show up around 7am which makes serious lap swimming problematic.",5,
"Let’s be clear, you go to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for the view. And especially the view from the infinity pool.    The rest of this sprawling complex is also generally well appointed. And the hotel staff, excluding the concierge desk, are efficient and helpful.  If you know Singapore or if you know you just want to go to the pool and shop, this hotel may be perfectly fine.    However, owing to the varied range of clientele and understaffed security, if you want peace of mind, this may not be the right place for you.  Also, if, like me, you tend to rely on Concierge services, absolutely do not stay here. I lost several days of precious holiday time and missed out on numerous activities because several members of the Concierge Desk ignored, forgot, delayed, or mishandled…",3,
"I stayed here four days and was completely frustrated from the moment I arrived and got into the long line to check in.  The hotel is in a complex with a casino and possibly the largest mall I have ever seen. Hundreds of stores. The hotel has over 2,000 rooms. They must have all been filled because when I was there the whole complex was a mad house. There were long lines everywhere in the hotel and the mall. I wanted to get something to eat and the hotel restaurants all had lines so I walked to the mall and the restaurants there had lines too. Then I walked to the food court in the mall and saw lines of people at all the vendors. Plus there was no where to sit! People were standing in line to get food and when they got it they leaned against a wall and ate standing up.  I was…",2,
"We stayed for one night at the beginning of Dec arrived early and our room was ready , had booked a club room and found out that they had upgraded us to an Orchid Suite it was amazing, fantastic views and bathroom to die for. Club 55 was well worth it food drink and service exceptional , in fact from the moment we arrived until we checked out every member of staff we encountered were excellent we never had any problems getting lifts and the infinity pool is amazing. If I am ever lucky enough to visit Singapore again this would be my first choice for a hotel.",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for 10 days including the Singapore Grand Prix and in our opinion, its the perfect base camp from which to enjoy the whole experience. Sure, its expensive but you've already blown the bank on your tickets so why not go for broke. You wont regret it.  After a short airport transfer (no pre-booking required - local taxis are readily available and even the ""executive"" line of vehicles they offer work out much cheaper than any transfer company I could find), the first thing you notice is the size of the building and this grand scale continues inside. Check in at the tower one desk was fast, efficient and being given our room at 0900 after a 14 hour flight was an absolute dream.   As big as the resort is and taking into consideration that it…",5,
"We had a 3 night stay at MBS to round off our vacation last month, it was one on our bucket list as we wanted the infinity pool experience. We arrived at the hotel via the MRT direct from the airport (so simple and so cheap!) station takes you straight into the shop part of the hotel complex. We made our way to check-in desk and were checked in efficiently (there were some hic-cups with connecting to the credit card authorisation system, but this was resolved quickly) and our luggage taken for delivery to our room. We were shown to our room, and were delighted with our choice. We'd opted for a Club Room King View (we had a view of the city from 44th floor) which included a package of breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés served in Club55 (on the 55th floor).…",5,
"I paid more than $ 3,000 US.Dlls. for 2 nights for my family of 2 adults, 3 teens and 1 child because the hotel looks great from the outside...Then at check in I was informed that I will get only 5 roof pool access cards and if I want to swim with my family of 6 I will have to pay $ 100 USDlls. extra per night... Then I get to my room and surprise, the Twin beds are Miniature beds, not comfortable to sleep 2 childs together ! Then I ask for a rollaway bed, and they inform me that is $ 120 US.Dlls. for each night, but they don't have enough...And the room has only 2 bottles of water, so they think my child doesn’t drink water ! Next morning at breakfast they inform that I only have included 2 adult breakfast, even though my reservation clearly says Bed and Breakfast package, and…",1,
"We stayed for 3 nights at Marina Bay Sands.  The hotel rooms are pretty large and absolutely gorgeous.   The hotel has 3 towers and 3 different reception to be able to help the hundreds of guests checking in and out every day.  The swimming pool can only be accessed by guests and is usually quite busy. Full of people trying to take nice photos and selfies. They have a swimming pool for kids.   There are some different restaurants in the building, my favourite one was downtown stairs in the 3rd tower, where I had the tradicional spicy crab ( 1 kg).  Under the hotel there’s a wonderful Mall, where I found a theatre and lots of nice stores such as Armani, Gucci , Louis Vuitton and Many others .  Overall it was a nice stay , however , it feels like you are staying in an Airport,…",5,
"Have been staying a couple of times in this hotel but first time in Club Room - this makes a difference! Lounge is very comfortable and staff is amazing - well trained, service minded, nice and with a personal touch! Highly recommended!",5,
"No doubt Marina Bay Sands is the best place where to stay in Singapore.  Amazing roof top pool with Malaysia view, great sushi / fusion restaurant Kudeta, super roof top bar with kind staff, big rooms, very social atmosphere - you will enjoy the hotel even if you stay there alone accidently :) I need to come back soon",5,
The staff at the hotel were extreamly helpful my partner was away for her bday and i got intouch with the front office amd the made sure the parcle i orginised got to her  and they upgraded her room and also sent a little something to her room for her birthday themselves it was really nice that people still go the extra mile. And i will certainly be staying there next time im in Singapore. And my partner loved the experience and what the hotel offered . ,5,
"Simply excellent service. I could not fault our stay here. From the moment we arrived, we were collected from the airport as we arrived early morning, complimentary limousine service. Which was amazing as our daughter suffered from travel sickness the last hour in the air and was still vomiting upon arrival.  We had asked for an early check via reservation from NZ, they said they would see what could be done upon arrival. To our surprise they were ready to check us in at 5am in the morning so we managed to settle the girls and unpack, relax and head up to the pool for an early morning swim. The check in service was outstanding the best we have ever had. Highly recommended paying the extra for club access, it’s seems to provide you we a higher service level and nothing is an…",5,
"My wife and I did scape for a 4 days trip to Singapore, I lived there before for 2 years and now I am a constant traveler to the Country and I never been in the famous Marina Bay Sands so we choose this place for our romantic travel.  At the beginning the hotel looks like any other, nothing spectacular as it is outside, check in a bit crowd but efficient, front office give us a room at 8am that is a big plus in my experience as you just want to lay in the bed after a long travel, so very good for that, the person that was helping us recommend and upgrade but we needed to wait until room been cleaned, we decide to take our booking, here to be honest after seen the room I was completely dissapointed as the room is far to looks like a 5 star hotel, I have been stayed at Ritz…",5,
We had to try the 57th floor infinity pool so staying at the hotel is a must. Club Room package is a great deal.,5,
"Loved this hotel, especially the infinity pool. We opted for the club room which included breakfast, afternoon tea and canopies with drinks in the evening. Wouldn’t do this next time as we didn’t use it all apart from breakfast. Would book bed and breakfast if they have that option.   Great hotel 😁 ",5,
"We can say nice place with amazing view from the pool and from the room, to the  botanical garden but too much chinese from mainland china that destroy whatever is nice over there.  We spent 4 night and start your day with breakfast  at the sky pool make your journey amazing . Must try one time really something unique. One night we been per dinner at Ce La Vi sky bar and yes we enjoy a simple food but surrounded of something with incredible charm. Cheers ",3,
Awesome place.. Take d ticket and see d complete view f Singapore. Recommend to visit in d Kate evening hours so that u can enjoy both d views. One in d sunlight and second when lights are all over in Singapore ,5,
"My man & I stayed at the MBS to conclude our last night in Singapore! It was definitely worth every penny. The rooms are so spacious, has a beautiful view, the service is superb and the pool view was to die for. ME (I believe that was her name! I lost my ""notes"" on my phone so I hope it's correct) assisted us when we got in. She was so helpful and accommodating! It was our anniversary so we got upgraded to a higher floor with the water view of the Merlion! They also sent up a platter of exotic fruits, chocolate,  water bottles & roses on the bed & bath tub! SO SWEET! It was a beautiful property and we enjoyed every minute of our stay! It is highly recommended!",5,
We were delighted with the warm welcome and the customer service team as they helped us in early checkin at 9 am and city view room was just amazing .Sky park view was beautifully curated and experience as really good .,5,
"I really loved our 2-night staycation at MBS - from the smooth check-in process, to spending 13 hours by the rooftop infinity pool - to our dinner at Spago; our stay felt like a dream. The best part for me was the adults-only section at the pool - sheer bliss!   The staff were amazing - especially Karla and Anna at the rooftop pool - they took care of us and were perfect in timing when we wanted to order more drinks/breakfast/lunch. The team at Spago is also top notch - on top of a lovely steak & wine dinner, we had their burger by the poolside for lunch which we can safely say - was one of the best burgers we've had.  We had a sky view room on the 42 floor which was gorgeous - especially at night when the buildings were all lit up. The premium room was spacious - with a lovely…",5,
"This was our first time to stay here and everything was just amazing. The service, amenity, rooms etc.  everything was very well organized from check-in to check-out. Room was in good condition.  One of the BEST customer service i have seen.",5,
"This hotel is grand, in its size, its furnishings and its feel. The marble and the deep carpets exude luxury. The room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom is the most gorgeous bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. The bed was also extremely comfortable. However, due to the size of the hotel, it is somewhat impersonal. The staff were not as friendly as some others we have met on our holiday and the hotel is so big it is difficult to navigate. The gym was tiny for the size of the hotel and not very well equipped. It is worth coming for one night to enjoy the room and the pool, which is really incredible, that is without doubt. Otherwise, it is overpriced for what it is, which is just a nice and architecturally amazing hotel.",4,
We were delighted with the whole experience. We were contacted by Hotel a few days before to pre- checkin - where we requested an early checkin as our flight came in at 8am. - checkin is normally at 3pm. But you can still use the pool area if you arrive early - which is good to know. We caught an uber from the airport and went to tower 1 as instructed. It is an enormous hotel and imposing and very busy but well organised. Polite reception who noted it was my birthday soon and therefore allowed us to checkin early - result!  Room on 21st floor had a lovely view of the Treetop gardens (?) beautiful Room With impressive electronic opening curtains. As we were in tower 2 it was a convoluted route to get to Floor 57(?) where the pool was. Loved the fact there was a separate adults…,5,
"We so loved our stay a few years back.  So, we decided to come back, this time with the kids.  Stayed in 2 rooms beside each other.    It was the birthday of our eldest and they sent a cake for her.    Breakfast was awesome!  Love the food selection!  They will give kids some crayons and paper to keep them busy for a while.    You can try their express check out to save time from queuing.    Lots of luxury shops and good restaurants around.  Perfect location! ",5,
"No photo will ever give justice to this place! The views from the top will leave you breathless, the bar by the infinity pool is like being in the sky sipping martini on the clouds ! Too bad the kitchen closes at 10:00 pm and we didn’t know .... not even bar food is served after 10:00 and that was a bummer. When you are there you just don’t want to leave",5,
"We didn’t do a lot of research and simply booked the hotel so we could go into the infinity pool. We were absolutely delighted with the room.  And the pool lived up to its expectations.    Hotel also has a fantastic central location. Make sure to visit both of the free light shows, one at the Shoppes on the bay and one at the sky trees.    Breakfast buffet was delicious too!",5,
"We stayed here at the Marina Bay Sands due to the picture quality of the archectecture and the rooftop pool.   The hotel is large, the room is large, but not luxurious compared to others in the area which is why I only gave it a 4 star rating. The hotel is so large, there is no personalized service and they have an early check out compared to others.   Overall, the rooftop pool is amazing and having an MRT stop and attached mall is very convenient.  You should experience it for at least one night while in Singapore, but look at other hotels for the luxury experience as well.",4,
"It is absolutely AMAZING here. It is so clean and beautiful The hotel is absolute perfection, as are the amenities! The infinity pool being a huge highlight of course - the views of the city from the pool and even the restaurant attached are breathtaking, especially if you like being up high. The surrounding are is a beautiful place to take a stroll and also shop till you drop! If you love designer brand shopping then the shopping complex across the street is perfect for you! It has every brand you could possibly wish for.  Take a stroll in a foull circle around the water, especially at night all the different buildings and structures look stunning!! A lovely area to spend some of your vacation in.",5,
"A huge hotel that caters well for all the family. Very efficient, good service and great location.  The infinity pool is the big draw with amazing views but can get very busy.   We ate mainly in Club 55 where the food was good and the service excellent.   We had a Club room which was very clean and easily accommodated a family of 4. ",4,
"Wonderful and exciting stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. I was thrilled! It is a bit different hotel, it made me think more of an airport, but yet the welcome was nice and friendly and i was allowed to check in slightly earlier- thank you! The room was great, the view as well. Location just excellent!! Direct access to the mall and to Gardens by the Bay, which are so beautiful! Room service was kind and efficient, food quality was very good. Wifi was very good. The best of this hotel is of course the unforgettable and extraordinary infinity pool - amazing!!!! The stay in the hotel was worth every SGD :) thank you again for a great experience !! ",5,
"Superb place, everything is next level here specially shopping. All luxury brands u can easily find here. Worth visit and spend here. Swimming pool is very popular. Must visit property in Singapore, dont miss this.",5,
"I stayed at the hotel for three nights, granting me access to all hotel amenities including the infinity pool. The room provided was in immaculate condition, and the attention to detail by all staff was 7*. I had a garden view on the 37th floor and this provided a very scenic and relaxing experience.  The pool is the best part of this hotel, it is well managed and a great way to watch time fly by! I can recommend this hotel to all.  Further, it is within walking distance to Gardens by the Bay, and cabs / MTR are both easily accessible.  I hope this post was useful, I have included some photographs below of the pool!",5,
"We stayed here for one night on our way to Australia for our honeymoon. The service that we experienced was exceptional. The kind staff allowed us to check in at 9am, which meant we could have a sleep and have the rest of the day to explore the city. They also allowed us a later check out due to us not flying until 9pm the following evening.   We would really recommend paying a little extra for the executive suite, which allowed you access to Club 55. We enjoyed afternoon tea and then later on drinks and nibbles. The view from the club was sensational and staff were very welcoming and gave us advice on where to visit during our stopover. For breakfast we were able to make a reservation at Wolfgang Puck on the 57th, which again was great food, made even better by the wonderful…",5,
"It is a must do at some stage if going to Singapore to stay at this hotel, The views are great from the top in the pool & the food in most restaurants is good but after a couple of days you want to go to a pool & relax not having hundreds of people walking into you taking selfies. The food is good but not outstanding for the price you pay & we ventured out to eat for cheaper & better tasting food. The one think that was superb was the dessert shop which had great rolls & cakes Which in Singapore standards was reasonable in price. On the whole I would stay again but I think. A night or 2 is enough. ",4,
"We have stayed there for my wife's birthday. Rooms are quite nice indeed, larger than usual with a nice overlook to the bay. Bathroom was also quite luxurious and nice. we were however in a lower floor that gave directly to the reception which made it quite noisy outside. The pool is amazing and really what you come for. We could not enjoy the breakfast as too crowded and too much of a queue. Hotel is well located close to a huge shopping mall and the bay",3,
"Must visit whilst in Singapore. So much to do around here and all easily accessible. The mall, light show, hotel, restaurants, etc etc are all great. If the weather is bad you can do most of these activities all indoors too.",5,
I spent a night at this hotel on my Birthday. The room is just awesome. They provide water dispenser which I really like. The room is facing garden by the Bay and we could see the magnificent view. Will definitely come back.,5,
"This was an amazing place! we had amazing views and the Infinity Pool on the roof was fantastic, busy but fantastic. Every restaurant we ate in was awesome especially the rooftop buffet at breakfast. Loved and would stay there again!",5,
"Fantastic size room and set up for families at Marina Bay Sands. Huge room and bed set up. Basically it is like an apartment with a small living area, large balcony, huge bathroom and additional toilet. Could not have asked for more.",5,
Amazing hotel. We had a club room which gets you access to the club 55 lounge.. breakfast.. Amazing. Afternoon tea.. Amazing.. cocktails and canapes.. Amazing. All complimentary with a club room. Swimming pool on the roof and views are also a highlight. Pricy but worth it for a special trip.,5,
"checkin was prompt. Lift was fast to the room.  Room size was good and lighting was good.  Toilets was clean and bright.  Well stock amenities.  Bed sheet and towels was clean, Air conditioning  functioning well.",5,
Booked on hotel website and found we were given a choice of views to choose from when we checked in which was nice - chose the city view which was great.  The room was on 30th floor and very spacious as was the bathroom.  Straight up to the pool for a look and straight back down to the room to get changed - that bucket list item is ticked!  Loved it.  Found the staff very welcoming and helpful with suggestions.  Great eating down at the food court at the adjacent shopping centre.  Would be hard to go back to Singapore and not stay there!,5,
"This was my 3rd stay at this hotel and its every time a breathtaking experience as per the architecture the view and the facility but i still really struggle with their overall attention to clients so here below the detailed feedback i gave them on their internal survey: I found your staff a litte ""rude"". I perfectly understand that you are the iconic hotel and landmark of Singapore and that you need a strong and reliable organization to manage the immense flow of visitors and guests. But I found your service a little impersonal and abrupt. for the standard level of your hotel, a smile , a little help, or just adapting your process when needed would have make our stay unforgettable. > excessive queuing to the registration desk when you already asked for information for…",5,
"Impossible to beat the panoramic views from the the SkyPark pool at the hotel.  Beyond amazing.  Definitely a hip place to be and been seen.  Mixture of all ages and visitors from all over the world.    The rooms are very spacious and extremely comfortable.  The pillows are super comfy.  Tried buying them, but was told they hotel doesn't have them for sale.  :-(  Concierge is extremely helpful.  I asked them where I could buy a power converter for something I needed to charge.  They said they would send one up to the room for me.  When I got back it was there.  Super fast.  Housekeeping makes cute little animal figurines out of the hand towels.  Super, super creative and cute.  Definitely looked forward to see what new animal greeted me when I got back to the room at the end of…",5,
"This was one of my bucket list places , mainly to be able to swim in the infinity pool ! Our stay was better than we expected with great shopping and dining within the same complex. Great position and a great stay !!!",5,
"We choose this hotel to celebrate our anniversary, we booked a Skyview Premium room with a view of Marina Bay. Per request, our room is at 46th floor.  Room is huge, bigger than I expected, as we have brought our son along, the couch serves as his bed so that we need not get an extra bed. Not forgetting the room is clean, comfortable, nothing much to complain about  This is probably the most expensive hotel that I have stayed, but it certainly worth every penny, with the view, infinity pool, everything adds up (btw, their business is really good, occupancy rate seems very high)",4,
We visited Marina Bay Hotel 57 level restaurant and the view is amazing. We enjoyed the view and this place is worth visiting. Great service and very friendly staff.,5,
"We booked a Grand Club room, totally worth it for including access to Club 55 for breakfast, drinks and afternoon tea.  This hotel is a destination in itself, with the most famous pool in the world, the restaurants, and the shops at the nearby mall, you can easily spend a few days without leaving the hotel.  The staff was great, they were always courteous and friendly, and I don't know how, but some of them even remembered our names.",5,
"This has too be the best hotel I have ever stayed in, from the spectacular rooftop to the spacious rooms.      The is soo much to do at the hotel there is something for everyone, the hotel location is great and very central. The rooms are clean and spacious which was very nice      I booked direct with the hotel which was easy and cheaper",5,
"This is the iconic hotel pictured on the front of every guide book. We chose to have a club room which means free use of Club 55 between 7am and 7pm and provides breakfast,tea and between 5 and 7 canapes and free drinks. The service in the hotel from booking  in to leaving-was fabulous in all respects with an extra special mention for the club 55 staff. there was so much top quality english and chinese food available we didn’t eat out once in our five day stay. The only complaint was the sun beds around the pool were too low for my disabled wife and there were no chairs. Worth every penny and definitely going again when i’ve saved up. On our way back through Singapore we stayed at another hotel where the personal service was as good but the food wasn’t.  ",5,
"We loved this hotel. The service was fast and excellent from check in to check out. Our room was exactly as expected, clean, comfortable, with a great view and WiFi. Hotel TV wasn’t the best but they had a few movie channels.  The pool is of course amazing, that view is incredible. Definitely worth the stay! So many other great things at MBS though: the casino, the bars, Club 55, easy connection to the Gardens, etc.   Only thing we were disappointed in was the food from room service. Some of the things we had were so gross they weren’t edible although we found a few things we liked. Just for how expensive it is, you’re definitely expecting a knock out meal every time.  Overall, great stay we really enjoyed it and would stay there again next time we come to Singapore.",5,
"As a hotel person over my life, this is one of the best in sg. Value wise on non-peak rate are also very reasonable compare to sg overall high spending hotel. for the rate vs the stuff I get from mbs. I rather pay double for this then the normal 100ish rate",5,
"Great hotel,located within a shopping complex which makes it convenience. There is a theather and casino which is within the complex. A reasonable price of food court also available. Adrift bar is excellent and the staff is super friendly",5,
"Stayed there for our honeymoon and this was the right place to spend our time. It’s got everything just with walking distance like heaps of fancy shops, celebrity restaurants, huge food court, gym with sky view, and of course the super famous skypark with its very beautiful infinity pool !  If you stay here, you don’t really need to go outside the hotel, even though you want, they have MRT just below the building.  The minor issue was just the service, even though this is the hotel with very friendly staffs (sincere smile is one of the hardest thing you can get in Singapore). But still highly recommend to try this place!",5,
"It is impossible to book this hotel without understanding the sheer size of it. A lot of people criticise how busy it is and how expensive it is. Upon booking you know the price and from the pictures you have no doubt seen you know how big it is so of course it is going to be busy. With this in mind you cannot expect four season style intimate touches from the staff.  We stayed in a club room in tower one on the 17th floor, slightly disappointed with this allocation however this is short lived as soon as you enter the room. We also had a garden view as opposed to the bay view which I am glad about. You spend a lot of your time in the bay area or in the pool over looking it so its a nice change of scenery to come back to your room and relax on your balcony.  Our morning routine…",5,
"Amazing hotel with the most sensational Infinity Pool!!!  Could literally lay by the pool all day.  The view is out of this world.  Service was great, staff extremely attentive.   Rooms were spacious, lovely bathroom, mini bar fully stocked.  Service was great throughout the hotel.    Fabulous views and great location.  ",5,
"The hotel is absolutely amazing and one to tick of the bucket list if you're staying in Singapore.  Upon pulling up to the hotel, we were greeted with a smile and a cornetto (what?!) off the consort. There were plenty of staff at hand to take our bags and make queuing less of a chore. The receptionist gave us tips, asked questions and was generally a big help.   The hotel is grand, lavish, modern and beautiful as were the rooms, although not hugely different to other 4* hotels I have stayed in in European cities. The curtains opened with the press of a button, room service were incredible and the views, spectacular",4,
"We decided to stay at the MBS for one night on a recent trip to Singapore and found it to be worthwhile. The infinity pool does not disappoint and is why we felt that it was worth to stay for a night. We didn't feel that the rest of the hotel warrants the price, particularly if you are going to spend much of your time exploring the city. However, it's still worth a night or two to enjoy the pool and view if you're traveling a long distance to get to Singapore.",4,
"This hotel is massive.  It has everything that you need, but be prepared to empty your wallet as everything is over priced.  Must go to the Sky Park and Infinity pool.  Staff here is excellent and very helpful.  If you need to exchange currency, do not do at the mall.  You get better rates in Chinatown.",5,
"The rooms are nice, but a bit smaller than what I expected and the finishes didn't feel all that superior to me for a hotel that's considered one of the best in the world and a must do.  The location and the facilities are top notch! Firstly, this is a hotel that you will not to leave often to do anything.  Any high end or mid-level shop that you can think of is here! Gucci, Hermes, Prada, Dolce & Gabana to name just are few are here for your purchasing pleasures.  Dining options are endless.  Not only are their many celebrity-chef restaurants, but the food court Rasapuras Masters offers countless options. Banks, money change shops, jewelry stores and the Casino are all just a few footsteps and an escalator ride away.  You don't even leave the hotel facilities to get to the…",4,
"Wow, what a hotel.  Stayed in a Club Room on the 47 th floor with stunning views over Gardens by the Bay to the ocean.  The room was beautifully appointed, well set out with a luxurious bathroom.  Access to Club 55 was well worth the extra price to book a Club room with a great breakfast, wonderful afternoon tea and then an all inclusive pre dinner drinks and canapés from 5 to 7, some days you just don’t need to leave the Hotel!  Spending some down time at or in the infinity pool 57 floors above Singapore is something that will live with me forever.  Can’t wait to return, just need to save harder.",5,
Marina bay sands is amazing property in Singapore. Gardens by the bay and MBS skypark are amazing attractions. Mall is amazing! Great stores to shop. And many options to eat. Infinity pool is highlight of the stay,5,
"We visited this hotel en route to Australia and for all intents & purposes, it suited all our needs. Whilst ordinarily we prefer smaller, intimate hotels (such as Raffles), we thought that we would give The Marina Bay Sands a whirl. This hotel is BIG. Very Big. It’s sister hotel is The Venetian in Las Vegas, to give you an idea. The hotel is situated in three towers. All the towers are then joined by the massive swimming pool situated on the 57th floor of the hotel, with magnificent views over the whole of Singapore! This swimming pool is only accessible to residents with a room key and there are also restaurants where you can get some food and drinks. The Infinity pool, looks like you are about to swim into the street below! The rooms are big too. We had a 2 bedroom Suite,…",5,
"I stayed here for three nights, and loved it! It is really expensive, but when you are there, you know why. I stayed on the 9th floor in Tower 3, and had a room facing the ocean and gardens, rather than the Bay. I actually requested this, as the rooms facing that way have “balconies”. They are actually sliding glass doors that open. It’s good to allow some air in for a few minutes. The view of the gardens is fun! And if you are up much higher, you actually look over them and don’t have much of a view.  This is a great alternative to the expensive rooms facing the bay, but you still have all the guest benefits, including the use of the infinity pool! So worth it. You get discounts at the mall next door as a guest as well.  Personally, I skipped the breakfast and went to one of…",5,
"I went to Singapore to celebrate my uncle's birthday and we decided to stay at this hotel. The room that I got is a standard room with balcony overviewing the Gardens by the Bay. The room is very spacious, even the bathroom is also spacious. The bathroom features a double sink, partitioned off toilet bowl, spacious walk-in shower and a bathtub. The amenities you get is also very nice and they would give you more if you ask.",5,
A room at Marina Bay Sands is a once in a lifetime experience. We had a room overlooking the bay which was an awesome sight every morning.  Of course the pool is also great although it‘s not really possible to properly swim there. But it‘s great to relax after a long day out and about in the city.  The breakfast in the restaurant next to the pool was very good too.  The gym is rather small but perfectly fine for a regular workout. ,5,
"First the good stuff- the hotel itself is AMAZING. The architecture is stunning and the furnishings are top notch. Location can't be beat, especially with the gardens in close proximity and all the shopping and restaurants right in the hotel. Wifi is fast, rooms are huge and luxuriously finished (great bath products too!), and the VIEW from the room (city view) is fantastic. And of course, THE POOL. The view is absolutely breathtaking, especially if you're up there for sunset. Only hotel guests are allowed by the pool, and it would definitely be worth it to stay at the hotel even for one night just to experience this. However, there are some downsides to the hotel. Check in took quite a while due to the sheer number of people checking in. At any given time, there are also swarms…",4,
"Location : Great location, equipped with Luxury Mall, MRT in downstairs and Attractions around   Check In - Fast and Effective if you filled up Pre- Arrival Form   Check Out - Just drop the key and check out form in the lobby check out box ! we dont need to queue   Room : Bay View is the best . the room is spacious with elegant bathroom . the balcony is provided to help us see the beautiful view from the top .   Must Try : Infinity Pool ! but i recommend to go early morning because it will be crowded in the afternoon .   Breakfast Buffet : High Quality food , from Western to Asian . psst .. they have 3 kinds of Milk !   this hotel is expensive but its worth to stay for 1-2 days only because however, the shopping mall bit boring comparing with Orchard Area   to sum up , i still…",5,
"My family had a wonderful day in this iconic hotel last week. Its so nice of MBS to offer us a free upgrade of room. We loved the room, pool and the views at the top of Singapore. The staff was very friendly and caring too.",5,
"As soon as you enter the lobby it's like entering a different world , it's huge and oozes class . It feels even bigger than it looks , all you can see is space , it's vast but even though there are lots of people around , it does not feel crowded . Check in was easy and quite quick as there were plenty of staff to deal with a large queue , we even got an upgrade as it was our first time at hotel . The room was exceptional , huge with plenty of high tech and as you would expect it had a high level of finish , huge bathroom and balcony , ours looked over Singapore gardens . Staff were always polite and cheery while dealing with you but ignored you if just passing , no good morning as they passed and they tended to avoid eye contact .Views from the roof top were amazing and the…",5,
"The scene from the infinity pool are definately worth it. Friendly lifeguards and pool waiters. There are even professional photographers to help you take photos ! The foods and drinks are as good as they looks like. Remember not to bring the foods and drinks in the pool, you can have it at the pool side as there are sun bed provided. Suggest to go to the pool during the morning (the pool opens at 6am) as there will be less crowded. 12 pm and during evening are the peak hour, and you will not want to be burned under the scotching sun during afternoon.",5,
"This place is an absolute must, even if it is for 1 night. We were meant to be staying for 1 night but extended to 3.   Positives: -pool and view -room size, cleanliness and amenities  (stayed in Deluxe King- free upgrade from twin room) -great Wi-Fi speed -very secure - all staff are extremely polite and friendly (especially Jeevan, one of the managers) -breakfast at RISE is AMAZING! -hot and cold filtered water machine in the room.  Negatives: -poor staff communication (the hotel is just too big) -took around 40 minutes to check in - You have to regularly sign back into the Wi-Fi - You can often find yourself queuing for a lift for quite some time. -drinks are extortionate. You need a LOT of money if you plan to 'do it properly.' ",4,
"This is Las Vegas style luxury in Asia, in one of the best locations in the city. An amazing hotel, where it’s iconic shape cuts through the Singapore skyline day or night. We stayed in a Club Room that gives many extras and access to inclusive breakfast, afternoon tea and early evening drinks and canapés at Club 55. The main event is of course that infinity pool and the view it offers, which has to be experienced as no words can convey it's appeal and impact when you first see it. Our room was well appointed and spacious. Being on 46th floor it overlooked the Gardens at the Bay and those amazing trees, which were so beautiful when lit. Large comfortable bed and all amenities one would expect with the indulgence offered – dressing gowns, slippers, stand-alone bath. The gym was a…",5,
"We went there for a family holiday and booked the room facing the famous Gardens by the Bay. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything went perfectly smooth. The room we stayed at was very spacious and the view was amazing. Of course we went to the famous Infinity Pool which located at 57th floor. You have to transfer at level 34th to make your way to the 57th floor. A little tips if you want to take your picture at the infinity pool, go early in the morning at around 7 am. The pool opens at 6 am but if you go at 6 pm it’s still very dark in singapore so you won’t be able to take nice picture. There is also an elevator at the lobby level to go to the shoppes at marina bay sands. If you want to go to gardens by the bay, you can take the elevator right outside…",5,
"We are stayed here for 4 nights on the way to Melbourne. We have done many stop overs over the years and this beats the lot hands down. 3 of us me wife and daughter 15. The hotel has everything and centre to everything else. Views, shops, great food, super service, great weather, clean, safe, friendly.",5,
"We stayed here for two days in October of 2013.  After booking our airfare to Singapore, we had to find hotels.  We knew the MBS was out of our price range, but after seeing the infinity pool we knew we had to go!  We ended up spending some of our trip at a CBD hotel, and our last two nights here.  We were glad we did! This was a total splurge but we didn't know if we would ever get back.  The check in process was easy.  We had requested a higher floor with a bay view, and they came through with an amazing room on the 35th floor of tower 1, facing the city.  The lobby is amazing, huge and filled with restaurants and shops.  The elevator is quick and access is granted via room key card.  Unique outside features include the nearby Gardens by the Bay, MBS shoppes (mall) and the…",5,
"The MBS is a high end huge hotel. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The restaurants have good food but area a bit pricey. The amenities are very nice, the signature pool, a great fitness center, a high end mall, a casino and easy access to the Gardens by the Bay. Overall a really nice experience. ",4,
"This was a staycation with my wife and 2 kids 4 and 2 years old. We decided to book a Club room as the lounge at Club 55 welcome kids of all ages. That, in itself is a huge plus point for us.    Our room was on the 39th floor with a breathtaking city view. Room was spacious enough although I wish I didn’t have to pay SGD10 for an extra fridge. From our room, our family could watch the light show from MBS each night.  As for breakfast, no complaints either at Spago or Club 55. Both offered decent selection of food with excellent service staff. Deserving special mention is Vinson at Club 55. His great sense of humour and attention to details made all of us feel very at ease. We looked for him the next evening but he was off shift. Lawrence, who served us did a great job of always…",4,
We had a room on the 49th floor. Stunning views and the rooms are very well appointed and spacious. Huge bathrooms with separate bath and shower and great amenity kits that may or may not come home with you ;) Utterly breathtaking pool and roof terrace!,5,
"We spent one night at this fabulous hotel en route from London to Sydney and am really pleased we made the decision to stopover. This hotel is one of the great wonders of the modern world and has the service to match.   It’s a quick transfer from the airport and we were thrilled to be upgraded to a suite on checking in. The room was more like a luxury apartment with huge living area, bedroom, walk in wardrobe and bathroom.   We loved the views, infinity pool and Ce La Vie rooftop restaurant.   A special word of thanks to the lovely male employee who helped us load of cases at Tower Three. He really made our departure memorable.   ",5,
"Near the beach; shopping, sightseeing, restaurants & bars nearby·Near public transit, the train station & the airport·Easily accessible by car.liked the large, clean rooms, though some said they were dated & maintenance could be improved",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is definitely an excellent hotel that one must try at least once, given all the amenities that they offer. The hotel is surely luxurious, the rooms are beautiful, the infinity pool access is definitely a highlight. The area around MBS is one of the best in Singapore, so there is much to do by simply staying there. The shops, restaurants, and overall experience is fantastic. However, one complaint that I had pertains to the in-room fridge. The one that they offer is a sensor-based one with items to purchase. If you want your own fridge to put your stuff (which is a must in hot Singapore), you'll be charged $10! This is a bit too much, even for a luxury hotel. It will be very easy for them to offer an empty, free fridge for their guests who already pay a hefty…",5,
"No doubt this hotel has amazing infinity pool and they charge for that only, apart from that rooms were ok basic ,view was amazing .u need a lot of effort to reach infinity pool(change elevator couple of time) , front desk staff was helpful. Stay if u want to see the amazing view from pool.",4,
Another engineering marvel in modern Singapore. There are three towers seventy stories high with a gigantic surfboard on top. On the surfboard is an infinity pool along with a bar restaurant. There is a giant observation deck on the 69th  floor that is accessible to the public. The incredible sights of the surroundings can be had by the guests and no guest alike. The towers are not in a row; they are on a curve. It is debatable whether the sights are more fantastic in the night or day so the best plan is to see both. This is a must see for any visitor to Singapore.  ,5,
"The Marina bay Sands is a must stay on your visit to Singapore. This establishment is the epitome of class and comfort at its finest. They are committed to meeting your every need with ease, courtesy and style.",5,
"Had always wanted to stay at MBS and finally got around to it a couple of weeks ago.  It is definitely worth staying here once, if for nothing more than the infinity pool, that said it has so much more to offer.  I don't think I had appreciated the sheer scale of the place and realized just how much it would feel like a huge Las Vegas hotel (I guess the clue was in the name!).   Stayed in one of the Orchid Suites, which was huge and spectacular.  The service was pretty good, my only complaint would be the cost. There are so many nice hotels in Singapore that I just felt that this was a bit too expensive to make it worthwhile.  My particular issue is that there were 3 adults in our suite (bear in mind its like 1600 sq ft) and one baby and I had specified this at the time of…",4,
"The best part about our stay was definitely the infinity pool! It was an experience like no other, we initially booked the 1 night stay here just to have access to this world class pool. However, the room and service did not disappoint. Amazing shopping, food, casino, view, and customer service.  I can not wait to return! Love it!!",4,
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in Nov. Reading a lot of negative reviews about check in, service etc. We were pleasently suprised. Checking in went smoothly.. the room was beautiful and clean and they gave us a higher floor since it was our anniversary. The infinity pool is out of this world, not crazy full like reviews state, we were so glad we stayed here. Its so central to everything and the mrt is right outside the hotel. U cant expect personalized treatment when checking in, like most 5star hotels, but its expected because of how many people stay here.. We will definitely return. ",5,
"Stayed in hotel for 5 nights.  We had a club room which was large, beautiful and very clean..  Location of hotel was great, the subway was underneath, close to great restaurants in the Marina Bay complex and the hop on and hop off bus stop was right outside.  The club room came with happy hour drinks and canapes in the restaurant each day which was delicious.   The staff were amazing, very organised and so friendly. Very glad we stayed there to see this hotel in action as it is huge but the known attraction of the swimming pool is overplayed as yes its amazing up on the roof but it is so crowded and not inviting due to the number of people swimming and taking selfies.",5,
"Stayed at MBS for 4 nights and my GF and I didn't really feel at home nor at ease throughout the duration of our stay.  I'm guessing that large percentage of the guest which MBS attracts are trying to get shed loads of post/picture ""LIKES"" Social Media pages and most of the guest whom we, unfortunately, have crossed path with are either ""rude"" or ""mannerless"".  It's a beautiful hotel but sadly for us ... that is it!!   It feels like either MBS hasn't got or has lost it's human-ness feeling.   We feel like almost all of MBS staff are running their modus operandi like robots on a clockwork.   Our relax time at the Infinity Pool was disturb every 15 mins by their staff, asking if we would like to buy any drinks.  Again, it's a beautiful hotel and most of my displeasure are beyond…",4,
"I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago. At that trip I only stayed one night. The impression was not that good. But I wanted to give it another chance, so I stayed there again last weekend. This time I am staying for two nights. It was a poor poor experience from the get go.   When I arrived at the hotel, I walked along the designated route to the check-in counter, then a hotel staff arranged for two female guests to cut right in front of me as if I did not exist. What the hack?  When I arrived, it was raining. In anticipation of a meeting outside, I called the ""Express Service"" of the hotel and asked for an umbrella to be delivered to my room. I was told that there was no such service. If I wanted an umbrella, I had to go downstairs and get one from the concierge, and it was on…",1,
"Booking was very easy so that’s a great start. Then VIP check in really made everything feel very special. I was an hour early but my room was ready, I was very grateful. Stunning City View from my Club Room in Tower Two on the 36th floor. One slight problem is that I did not want to go to sleep with that stunning view to look out at each night! The room and bathroom were enormous and spotlessly clean. Housekeeping does an amazing job. I had breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapés in Club 55 each day. The staff were perfect in every way. Calling me by name every time. Outstanding. The hotel is not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for. First class all the way. I will certainly be back. I have read some less than favourable reviews of MBS and I guess with 2500…",5,
"Check in appalling. Took almost an hour of standing in thick queue of people. Told by reception to check in at tower 1, but later found out we could have attended tower 3 for quicker check in (as our room was allocated to tower 3).  Stayed in tower 3, above 40th level, deluxe king sky view room, superb views over Marina Bay and look down on nightly water light laser show.  Hotel has easy convenient walking distance to adjoining shoppes & food court, underground train railway and Gardens by the Bay. Be prepared for a lot of walking!

"Located in the centre of downtown Singapour, this is a huge complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment. There is also a casino. Be aware there is a dress code. All the expensive names are there along with renowned chefs : Wolfgang Puck and Daniel Boulud. If you want to go up on the 57 floor to see the view and the pool you have to stay at the hotel. I suggest you make a  reservation at one of the two restaurants to gain  access. This is a beautiful feat of engineering. A boat on top of three pillars. The signature building of the city.   ",5,

I traveled with my wife & kids; we're very welcomed at check-in counter and in a moment we're guided to our preferred city view room in 47th floor.  The views from the skydeck was quite amazing. Apart from hotel guests, there're lot of people enjoying the views. The bay area, high-rises is in financial district, gardens areas were quite a view up from there.

"Our booking stated that check in was 3pm but we arrived earlier at 1pm. The check in queue was already quite long and took about 20 minutes to get to the desk. This was made better though by the complimentary drinks and ice creams which were being handed out while we waited. Our luggage was also taken from us while we waited and was later delivered to our room which was incredibly helpful as we had very large, heavy backpacks. Upon check in there was an unexpected $200 deposit we had to pay for incidentals so be aware of this. We were given our key cards and made our way to our room. When we first arrived our key cards did not work so we had to call the express service. A member of staff came within 5 minutes to open our door for us and took away our key cards.

We had a night in Singapore so decided to book into the Marina Bay Sands as a good way to start our holiday and we were not disappointed. Although we arrived early we were provided passes to visit the rooftop pool while we waited for the rooms to be made available which was a fantastic way to relax and take in the panoramic view of Singapore from the infinity pool which is the length of the Eiffel Tower especial after 14 hours of traveling.

The Marina Bay Sands, is, of course, one of the most famous hotels in Singapore, perhaps even the world. It features on just about every list of hotels to consider in Singapore or as an attraction in it's own right - the architecture is amazing (three towers topped with what looks like a boat).  We arrive at the Marina Bay Sands, perhaps 10.30/11am, way, way earlier than the 3pm check in time. We had our luggage, and we knew that the hotel had a left luggage facility for guests.

For what we paid for a 14th-floor room with a view of the casino's roof, we could have enjoyed a stay in a nice garden suite or a room with a really nice view of Singapore at other hotels in the Marina Bay area or in Orchard Road... Worse, the water in the shower and the lavatory sink would not drain. Disgusting! Told the front desk about it on my way out of the hotel, but when I came back 2 hours later nobody had fixed the problem.

It's super crowd for checked in, and have a short period of staying (I think check in around 2.30 and check out at 12pm).

"Marina Sands Singapore had been hailed and raved in almost every travel related publication and fora etc. Due to this my business partners and I finally decided to give it a go although it was in the busy holiday season of August!  First impression of the hotel was big and a little chaotic when checking in. There were all together 3 towers sharing the same main entrance and reception area which made it very crowded and noisy. Our room was on the high floor of tower 3 overlooking the bay and bay garden. Long walk to the lift before hitting the room.

Try come to this pool just before sunset, you will find a gorgeous city view with touch of beautiful sky colour.   Love the location, very close to Garden by the Bay and the Merlion Park. This hotel also connect to the big mall and Bayfront MRT station, will give you the advantage if you like to going around Singapore with this integrated public transportation.

"We stayed in the Marina Bay Sands hotel for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon. It was absolutely worth staying at MBS to experience the amazing infinity pool on the 57th floor, as well as great views of the gardens from our room. Our room was spacious and spotless and it was a nice place to relax after a long day.  Highlights for us would have to be the infinity pool and the observation deck. Also the access to the Shoppes was very neat.  I found the hotel staff very friendly and helpful, especially as I have a nut allergy and quite a few of the more standard items (toasted sandwich & chips from the pool bar) contained nuts. They explained that the chips were cooked in peanut oil and I could have a salad instead.",5,
"The hotel itself is fantastic! So much stuff to do here it's an attraction in itself! Extremely popular so there was a bit of a line to check in, but they offered free juice and waters and it went by quickly. We had a classic King room and loved it! Very spacious, awesome bathroom with a bath and a big shower! But what really won our hearts was the largest rooftop infinity pool in the world!!!! Absolutely stunning views of Singapore, delicious food and drinks, always had lounge chairs available, such a fun time!!! The hotel is also attached to tons of stores and restaurants/bars. The free light show is really beautiful and impressive as well. Loved it and highly recommend! ",5,
"I was dreaming about the Marina Bay Sands since many years and finally the opportunity to go to Singapore came last April. We stayed at Marina Bay Sands 3 nights and I found it very touristy and commercial.  Cleaning of the room ok. Amenities in the room very few and not high standard. The infinity pool at the 57th floor is of course a big WOW, but over crowded also at 7 in the morning. Service very cold and non-personalized. You just feel like another room number.",4,

It’s worth getting a club room as you then have access to “Club 55” which serves complimentary cream tea with drinks between 2-4 daily.

There are several restaurants to chose from within, including the fantastic “ Spago” which is on the the top floor next to the infinity pool.

Free WiFi throughout the hotel and very much welcomed upon check in. There was  slight queue when we arrived but staff provided…",5,
"Everything about staying at this hotel is Big and Impressive. The lobby, the rooms, the pool, the gym, the view. If you're looking for anything personalised or homely this may not be the place to look. Staff are very focused on their piece of the puzzle, but warm and friendly generally don't seem to be a piece of anyone's puzzle. The best things are obvious... the pool and the views. Also top marks for the rooms which are big (of course) and very comfortable. I was there for 7 nights and never graduated from total stranger to ""welcomed guest"". But if you want Big and Impressive I'm sure you'll be very happy! ",3,

This is such a beautiful hotel and what you pay for isn’t the room, it’s the experience. It’s waking up to an incredible view each day. It’s ample space and amazing breakfasts (we stayed in the Club Room). It’s being able to leave your room and go underground for some of the best fashion stores. All of that and more .   The team do all they can to make you feel so special too. We had little towel animals left every day, as well as a cake for my birthday. They are also so kind at the reception desk, and the cleaning team always said hello and smiled.   I would stay here again if I ever travel back to Singapore. ",5,

Everyone you speak to who represents that hotel is beyond helpful, funny and polite.   Check in was smooth, and our room was ready early. The city views from our room were incredible, and stunning to see at night when all lit up. The pool is as awe inspiring as you see in the photos. Plenty of sun beds and the staff who work by the pool do everything for you to help you enjoy yourself. There are people walking round asking if they can get your anything and everyone from the lifeguards to the pool side assistants have a smile on their face and say hello, good morning etc.   We had a reservation at Spago on the evening. The food was incredible…",5,

Enormous bathroom ..yes its expensive..but worth it for a couple of days.  Club 55 was just as everyone says...good breakfast evening canopies and endless champagne (never any problem getting a table or getting your glass refilled) ...afternoon tea was the poorest ...only one kind of sandwich ,tuna and sweetcorn the first day...lots of lovely cakes...but as someone who isn't so keen on the sweet stuff a little limited...made up by all the savouries in the evening.No point on going on…",5,

Our dream came true! ",5,
Booked this hotel for a night as a surprise to my partner and she wasn't disappointed. We have stayed in Singapore several times in the last few years and have only previously visited the Skydeck on level 57. As we had had a touch year I decided to book a room for 1 night during our stay. Booking was easy through their direct website and I went for a dearer option of a Grand Club City View room. Upon arrival check in was easy as with Club Rooms you check in through a private area behind the main check in desks. 10 minute wait but we were provided with a choice of free drinks and towels to freshen up. As we were early our room was not quite ready but they arranged to email me direct when it was and in the meantime provided temporary access to the Club Lounge which is provided…,5,
"this is a bucketlist experience, we had our last night in Singapore here before flying home. It was fabulous! We were upgraded to the 54th floor Orchid Suite and staff were lovely. While we waited for our room to be ready we wandered around the shops and ate at the food court which had a huge selection of food and reasonably priced. Heaps to do and lots to see, a quick walk to Gardens by the Bay and our room had a view of the harbour where we watched the laser show from. We had a swim on the rooftop pool & the buffet breakfast from Adrift which i think was over priced and went to the science museum before going out to the airport. A great stay has been on my to do list for a long time, to do Singapore you need to of stayed here :)",5,
"Lovely hotel, super friendly staff. Stayed here for 7 day’s to celebrate a milestone of turning 60 & loved everything about it. Our room was overlooking Gardens by the Bay. Gorgeous view of the gardens & ocean. Had breakfast at Rise one of the many restaurants located on the ground floor of the hotel. The staff were so polite & friendly & accommodated my need for gluten free food. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Highly recommend❤️",5,
"Had the pleasure of staying here for two nights in the way to Oz. Booked club class room with access to the club lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapés all included. All excellent. The staff were welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. We accessed the famous rooftop pool which was amazing if not a little windy. Preferred the pool at night when it was a little quieter and more spectacular in my opinion.  The bars along side the pool were a little uninviting due to conference guests. The hotel is huge as expected and as a guest in the lobby you’re a little invisible. Our room was fabulous with a stunning view. I recommend this hotel and would recommend the club class as good value for money. Certainly made the difference to our stay. ",5,
Its one of the best hotel of Singapore. Excellent for business. fancies and get-togethers.  I have seen that even local Singaporeans come and stay here for a change  .  Only 15-20 Minutes from the airport.,5,
"A promise fulfilled to stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel when last we were in Singapore. It did not disappoint! From the rooftop Spago restaurant and infinity pool to the Rise restaurant on the ground floor, the experience was delightful. Wonderful staff at Reception, Concierge, Room Service and dining areas. Very good buffet options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A true indulgence for Afternoon Tea, with a continuous trolley service of delicacies and specialist teas. Our preference was for Garden view, with a subdued light show throughout the night. Beautifully appointed room, with wet room and double bath. TV choices not extensive, but there is so much to do beyond one's room. Easy walking around the Harbourside to Cannings Fort, Raffles, Merlion etc, and of course the…",5,
"Well worth paying for a Club room;  this gives entry to Club 55.       Club 55 provides free breakfast, evening drinks and canapés.       Roof pool and gardens are wonderful. The ground floor where reception is located is a little austere, with no-where to sit while waiting for one's partner to check in. Excellent, friendly concierge service.",5,
"Worth every pennies. Fantastic view, clean and modern room. Ah, the pool was amazing. Very nice staff. We stayed there for one night. We had a sky view/ city view room on 54th floor. The view was spectacular.  One of a kind experience.",5,
"Room was spacious, modern and clean. Very impressed with the size of the shower. Good selection of toiletries and nice options for the mini-bar (if a little expensive). Bed very comfortable.  Good balcony (small but functional), we choose the side of the building overlooking the Gardens by the Bay which looked magnificent both day and night.  Infinity pool was nice but very busy, I recommend going either late at night or early in the morning to avoid the crowds as its not really relaxing swimming with fifty other people who are all trying to get the perfect selfie.   Would stay again.",5,
"This has to be a 'Must Do Before I Die' hotels experiences.  With 3 towers, this hotel is run with absolute precision. Although the prices are high and breakfast isn't complimentary I strongly recommend you stay for at least a night and enjoy the infinity pool and Jacuzzi areas the hotel has to offer.   November is the best time to go as it's low season and their is space to chill around the pool and restaurants.",5,
"The stay is great and the room is nicely prepared with a small and welcoming gesture in the room.   The beds are nicely prepared, room is clean, spacious, and the bathroom is really huge. The check in and check out counters may takes time but their service is top the notch, without the need to waste the time on queue, the staffs will check out it for you within a minute. Overall the stays are great and would come back again",4,
"i guess anyone who visits singapore has to stay at least one night in this hotel! what a place and what an experience. Totally recommend, even if it's for only one night. The infinity pool is just unique!",5,
"This is a lovely clean hotel. Very large and very busy! I asked for a different pillow and it was delivered within a few minutes. Staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast buffet had a good variety of options. My one gripe is no power point for the hairdryer in the bathroom. It's very difficult drying your hair with no mirror! Small thing but still annoying. ",4,
"I stayed for 4 nights whilst travelling on business around Asia and had a very good trip. The staff are fantastic, always available, willing and able to help, unfailingly polite and highly skilled. Even when asking for directions (the complex is huge) or serving you in one of the many restaurants or bars, they are friendly and experienced. The infinity pool is clearly the main pull and highlight of most guest's stay. I used the pool at 7am for lane swimming, 3pm for relaxing and 10pm for the thrill and it was always well kept, managed and run. Rooms are large and well appointed with good quality furnishings and extra touches like complimentary bottled water (not cold though!), plenty of toiletries, robes/slippers. We ate at Adrift, Bread Street Kitchen, Pizzeria and Osteria…",5,
"My friend and I had the luxury of staying in MBS for 1 night and it was magical. It was everything we hoped for and more! First off, when we arrived, we were escorted to the VIP check in desk (though we just booked a regular room). They had noticed it was my friend's birthday and quickly upgraded us to the top floor with a much bigger room and the view of Marina Bay Gardens. To top everything else off, they also sent us up some chocolates for my friend's birthday, which was a very kind gesture. The room was clean and modern. The view during the day and night was spectacular! The gym also had an amazing view of the city skyline. The bar C'est La vi was beautiful. Plenty of restaurants with decadent food. My friend wasn't feeling well the next morning and they allowed us 1hr late…",5,
"We decided to stay at marina bay for 1 night and the stay was worth every penny of it. As soon you enter the hotel you can soak into the luxury the hotel has to offer. We were directed to the check in counter and their we were offered complimentary drinks and ice creams. The check in guy was very courteous and he suggested us an upgrade to club room. Believe the services that you get in a club room are no match for the price they charge. He gave us this lavish, grand beautiful room on 46th floor with garden view. As soon as you enter the elevator you feel the grandness of the place and feel as a sultan of some place. Our room had a tub, shower area, and lots of space. We were given complimentary high tea and evening cocktails at club 55 which were very elaborate. Our room had a…",5,
"The scale and grandeur of the hotel, the unique Skypark, magnificent views and setting make this a must for a visit to Singapore if you can. The staff are also universally charming and helpful, provided you do not ask them anything out of the norm. This was particularly the case on check-in and check-out where the staff really seemed to struggle with English and to deal with the inevitable questions, leading to long waits for most.   The lifts are also a trial with long waits and often very crowded, so getting on at floor 55 to go to the lobby can often entail being squashed against the walls by someone in a damp robe and ten or more stops. Rooms are also not really 5*. Small details like there is no dressing table or plug points in the bathroom so hair drying is a matter of…",4,
"We booked an escape package for two nights of our five night stay in Singapore. Upon arrival for an extra S$200 per night we upgraded to a club room.  The room and views were spectacular and we needed some light refreshment after our long flight. This is when our troubles began because the enormous hotel was fully booked and the hotel management seem more preoccupied with guests maybe taking what has not been paid for. Unlike the much more relaxed approach at our second hotel, the incomparable Shanghai la, we found the staff picky about even having a free cup of coffee in the club room.  We booked a meal on the iconic pool deck and were told that we were not permitted to bring in food and beverage, which seems to us a very strange instruction for such an expensive hotel. There…",4,
"As we all know MBS is famous of the world-best roof top pool with great city view. I picked the room facing the ocean instead of the city; the view is perfect too. Do look forward to go again and next time I will pick the city view one. Oh, Skypark is amazing!  SG is a 365 days a year hot place, no idea why when i jumped into the pool at 2pm, the water was freezing! Shouldn't it be hot as its right under the sun ? lol",5,
We spent part of our honeymoon in this beautiful hotel! We upgraded and it was worth it. Friendly and helpful staff. Obviously incredible views! Loved it! Highly recommend this hotel if staying in Singapore.,5,
"Our stay here was very enjoyable with a luxurious room and balcony overlooking Gardens by the Bay. Day or Night, the view was absolutely spectacular, with breathtaking views of the cityscape from the poolside which can be accessed on the top floor. Entry to 'The Shoppes' below Marina Bay was just a quick walk as well as entry to gardens by the bay. Pool was often busy, with limited sun-beds however, staff were very friendly and welcoming. ",5,
The most fantastic place sky tower went up 56 floors what a view there's restaurants eateries up there souvenirs stunning views worth it to go up you get pictures taken pretty or costly $60  But we bought them as so nice  all around Marinabay is worth going to see,5,
"We checked in promptly after joining the check in queue but then realised there were about 7 receptionist checking people in, so it took minutes. The porter had already tagged our bags and they were sent straight to room after we checked in. As we were in tower 3 we walked the length of the hotel and it was only then we realised the size of the hotel. When we arrived at the room we put our room card into the holder to get the lights on. This after a couple of seconds prompted all the curtains to open.  Woooo ! The room was massive, bathroom massive, bed massive and the balcony massive too. As our room included free drinks and canopies at Club 55 between 5:00-7:00 it was time to chill and reflect on a fantastic room we had for the three night stay. The pool up on the 57th floor…",5,
"Obviously the iconic pool is the reason to stay at the hotel and the views from here are fantastic, however it is a tourist trap. Hundreds of people all taking selfies in the pool constantly somewhat ruin the luxury.  A hotel that is very, very overpriced for what it is. Rooms are very basic, in line with what you'd expect at a nice Hilton, no character to write home about. For the price I'd expect a lot more.  Stayed here for 3 nights, if returning to Singapore I would stay here for 1 night to enjoy the pool again then find a nice hotel for the remainder of the trip.",3,
We stayed for 1 day on the way back to Sydney. We arrived early at 9am and our room was available which was very helpful.  Firstly the views are fantastic we were on the 37th floor looking at the city. Floor to ceiling glass windows make the most of the views and also let you see the light show which is worth seeing at 8 and 9 pm  The room 47m2 is excellent with an enormous bath room including a separate bath.  Obviously the pool is spectacular  although all the poolside beds are always taken but there are enough beds back a row and slightly higher.  I found service at the restaurant to be slow with my meal coming before my wife's (5 min later). Many apologies and free cocktail but for the prices service should be better.  We ate downstairs before heading to the airport but…,4,
when we arrived on site we skipped the BIG queue and went to the sands lounge we then checked in and arrived at our room.The room was very posh and had picturesque views. the pool was completely unbelievably spectacular! it had breathtaking views from your lounge! we then had a nice dinner at club 55 and we slept happily. I rate this hotel FIVE out of FIVE stars! I would come back again!,5,
"I have a very good experiences with MBS. MBS have a very best services team work. I really appreciated that. I met Kate at the Front Office, Joel and Jamal who take good care my luggage, and also Shing Yi whos make up my room. You guys very nice and make us feel comfort. Thanks so much ..   ",5,
"My wife and I stayed here in a Club room for 2 nights when returning to Europe from Australia. Everything about this hotel is on a global scale with separate check in areas at each end of the hotel and over 2500 rooms.  Our room was on the 42nd floor with great city skyline views and plenty of space with a nice decor and a Nespresso coffee machine, which was a welcome touch. The only issue we had with the room was the air conditioning didn’t work very well and struggled to get the temperature down to where we would have liked.  With breakfast included, you can avail of 4 different venues including Spago on the 57th floor and also the Club lounge on the 55th floor. We opted for Spago which served a buffet selection with a wide variety of fresh fruits/pastries/cereals/Western…",4,
"This place is one of the best sights in Singapore and has one of the best city views in the world. For that reason, it's worth the $500+ you pay to stay there. It's owned by a Las Vegas based casino chain and it shows- you're in Singavegas basically. The rooms are sumptuous, the staff, for the 5 minutes you actually interact with a human at this soulless, beige giant, are very kind (our check in receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us, which was appreciated). Basically, if you like Las Vegas and/or high end shopping, you will like this place and choose it as your home base. If you don't, then you will fall in love with the view, but then check out in the morning and move to an adorable boutique hotel in a fun neighborhood or a comfy 5 star hotel like the Fullerton with charm. ",4,
"I wanted to visit after seeing it on TV documentary and it is a WOW . Had a beautiful room, shopping experience is something else if you love designer shops and the rooftop pool made my stay it was a BIG wow the views day and night . I couldn’t fault my stay at all. the daily water light shows over the bay were amazing and if you can I would recommend staying here I stayed on the 39th floor and the pool is on the 59th.   ",5,
"The hotel is quite luxurious (always a bonus after hostel stays) but the winner is, of course, the rooftop infinity pool. I didn't want to pay the money to stay but I'm happy I did. Just do it-you won't regret it at all. Added bonus: the gym is SPECTACULAR.",5,
"What an amazing hotel.The infinity pool on the top floor was awesome and the view was breathtaking.our room was on the 32nd floor and the floor to ceiling windows gave us a great view of the city skyline and the light shows in the evening.We stayed two nights prior to picking up a cruise,with breakfast included.The food on offer is great but it’s not cheap,and alcoholic drinks are very expensive.There is a huge shopping mall attached with a wide variety of shops . The staff are amazing.Overall a beautiful hotel and well worth a visit if you are going to Singapore.The gardens by the bay, are well worth a visit as well.",5,
"Always had a great stay here, been here on many business trips and always impressed. Great for a cocktail on the rooftop and the casino at your door step. Staff are amazing and help in anyway. Facilities next to none book now. Part of the Singapore experience is the marina bay sands ",5,
Stayed 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Price worth every penny.  Lots to see and do in the hotel and nearby vicinity. Our room overlooked the city and at night had fantastic views including the nightly light show.  Metro stops easily accessible for journeys further afield.  Infinity pool a must experience. Staff were excellent.  When in Singapore do stay for the experience!,5,
"Our honeymoon began with a 4 night stay in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands, it exceeded every expectation! We were upgraded to an amazing room with duel aspect on the 18th floor overlooking the gardens and harbour to the front and the city, the Merlion and the city from the other. The balcony meant we could watch the light and sound show from there, breathtaking! The room itself was superb. Immaculately clean and missing nothing. The nespresso machine and choice of coffees and teas was a lovely touch. All the windows and blinds were electronically operated and could more or less be done from your bed!  The bed was super king size and extremely comfy. The bathroom consisted of a really good shower, separate loo but best of all was the freestanding bath in front of a massive…",5,
"I believe everyone stay here for the famous infinity pool.  Nice experience yet I feel here is one of touristic place to go in Singapore.   nothing bad about hotel yet its just too many ppl for me. however, they got famous night club(celeve) , casino, fine dinning restaurants and shopping mall so its easy.  I recommend to go pool in the earliy morning so no one there lol and night time also nice! otherwise it s get too crowed and you wont enjoy.   Rooms: nice and we got Marina bay side and higher floor. if you do not know which room to book, i strongly recommend to book through call center, they help and ask your request!   it was nice yet the water leaking in the room by next to bed.  stuff came to fix yet it was not fixiable...so we got bucket and more towel.  they tried so it…",3,
"I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  It's a 5 stars hotel, pricey but the location is perfect if like myself you're there only for a quick weekend catching a show at the Theater.  I spent 36 hours in Singapore, 2 nights at MBS literally never set foot out of MBS complex, you'll find everything you need there.  However, for a 5 stars hotel it lacks the ambiance that you'd normally find in other 5 stars hotels nearby.  It might be due to their size, as it is a very big hotel, the queue for check out can be crowded. So use the express check out when possible.  Their famous Infinity Pool is very very crowded.  Again when you're used to the exclusivity of a 5 stars hotel, the sight at the pool will surprise you ... it is so crowded that for few seconds I forgot I was at a 5 stars…",3,
Right place to to go if u want to spend some hard earned cash. U have it all there from great restaurants to high end shops. They even have very fake venice boats :D great exsample of 21cebtury engeenering ,4,
"I have stayed at Marina Bay twice and it is a spectacular hotel.  It is a little touristy, but worth it for the cool rooftop pool.  Rooms are large spacious, and make sure you get a view of the gardens.    Also great restaurants, highly recommend checking out breakfast on the rooftop patio- it is pricy, but a nice buffet with a beautiful view.   ",5,
Place right in front of the sea and the Singapore river .. This place defines the infrastructure of Singapore .. You can go to the top and have a panoramic view of the City and the Sea .. You are not allowed near the Hotel Swimming Pool Area .. But trust me if you have he resources stay there for a couple of nights .. Its worth every penny of it,5,
"I always want to check in here in Marina Bay Sands as you will have the nice view of the whole city plus the luxury that you will experience. It is like a ship on top of the towers, amazing!  Will recommend it to all the people I know!",5,
"It's unfortunate that you have to walk by smokers, just to get in and out the front door if you go to the mall.   So disappointing!  The views are spectactular and it's a very luxurious hotel.  The service is phenominal.    I just abhor the fact that you have to subject yourself to stinkerettes just to get in the building.",4,
"If you are ever in Singapore you must visit the Marina Bay Sands hotel resort, it’s amazing. The rooftop pool spans across all three buildings at 65 floors atop and looks like an oasis in the air and being a zero edge pool it gives you the most incredible sensation when you float up to the edge and you’re overlooking the entire city of Singapore which is one of the most beautiful skylines on earth. There is also an amazing restuarant and bar up their as well and so much more to offer within the hotel itself. You must see it to believe it.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands rooftop infinity pool has consistently been ranked in various magazine and website top pools of the world, and it doesn’t disappoint in person. I was fearful it was going to be overrun by kids, but it was great to find out there was an adults only section of the pool! There was always enough chairs for our small group of three which was great as well.   The rooms are nothing to write home about for a hotel that was built only 7 or 8 years ago. They are very standard no frill rooms. It’s a very expensive hotel, and it’s because of the rooftop and the pool. I think it’s something you should do one night if your trip in Singapore.",4,
"We stayed two nights mid november in a Premier King City View Room.   Room was great and views tremendous.  The infinitty pool was well worth the visit as exceptional. Centre location, with easy walking distance to Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay.  The Gardens by the Bay next to the hotel is a must see.",5,
"A very unique visit to an iconic hotel. Room was very well cleaned, also the bathroom. I liked swimming at swimming pool but water was so cold. the provided Amenities were excellent. Having breakfast at top restaurant was exciting.",5,
"We decided to stay for a night in Marina Bay Sands just to experience the legend :) OK... it worth :) Enjoyed the pool, enjoyed the anniversary cake, enjoyed the views and all the other things you heart a lot! Go and experience :)",5,
Great views and iconic pool to swim in. We felt very welcomed and was delighted with the cleanliness and ambience of the hotel. Room service was excellent and the room was made up to 5 star standard compliments of the lass assigned to look after us. Will return. Highlight the pool swim.,4,
We stayed in  a club king room with the family during a short holiday in October. We were the 38th floor facing the city and the view was awesome.  We arranged a limo through the hotel to pick us up at the airport but we were sent a people mover van through a private contractor. Surprised that a hotel of this standard does not have their own hotel transfer service. Would not recommend the limo service as it is quite expensive and the taxi is much better and cheaper. The hotel itself is very busy . Need to allow atleast 45min for check in or check out during most hours of the day. The lobby area is like a market place with people everywhere at all times. The highlight of the hotel is obviously the roof top pool on 58th floor. Its an amazing pool and there are no deep ends so its…,4,
"Stayed for 2 nights in a standard room but paid a little extra for an upper floor and the views from 45th floor with city view is just great, rooms spacious and well equipped.  The hotel is a busy place but not overcrowded as some reviews suggest. Everything about the place is great, the pool, the restaurants and the service it’s just an amazing place and if in Singapore you must stay here. ",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is certainly worth the money. My Partner and I stayed here in August and although I had already fallen in love with Singapore, staying at Marina Bay Sands made staying in Singapore ten times better. We had a Garden View room and the room was very spacious, modern and clean. The view was spectacular and I would do anything to be back there right now. This will forever be one of the most memorable holidays of my life.  The infinity pool was so perfect and the cocktails were nice, but the highlight was definitely the views of Singapore. I'm so happy that a hotel like this was built, because you can truly appreciate how wonderful Singapore is. I am already planning on coming back to Singapore and staying here again. If you're planning on visiting, I would definitely…",5,
"Staying there was on my bucket list so when I planned my trip to Singapore I booked my stay there. The hotel is expensive and their room category/explanations are very confusing when it is your first time there but I was looking forward to it.  When we got to the hotel you could feel right away that you are just a number and you arrived at a Tourist Attraction. Be ready to be considered like a cash machine....to resume the feeling I had during our stay ""this hotel took the worst of a cruise and a Vegas hotel and mixed it together"".  The elevators are always crowded and you have to wait from 1 to 5 minutes sometimes to get one.  Do not get a room below the 34th floor if not you will have to take an elevator to the 34th then transfer to another elevator to the roof top pool and…",1,
"We stayed for one night at the start of a 5 night visit to Singapore, had a Club room overlooking the gardens and bay with wonderful views particularly at night. We had no problems/delays checking in or out but can imagine when its busy it can happen. Our deal included drinks and canapes on 55th floor which was outstanding, beautiful selection of exotic canapes, go back as many timesas you want, and drinks supplied to your table on request by pleasant helpful staff. Tried the pool at 9pm, great fun, one end isquiter than the other as a party was going on in Spragos with loud music. Sipped a glass of Prosecco on a lounger admiring the city lights.

"Wow is the word. This is a stunning hotel with stunning architecture. It should be on everyone's bucket list especially if you are already visiting Singapore.  The view on the pool deck and the observation deck is second to none, but this is it. Granted the rooms and hotel are clean but you expect it when you pay a small fortune. Here are a few problems. 1. The number one feature of the hotel is the pool but the hotel is BIG and the pool is overcrowded. The crowd can overwhelm the staffs with all the eating, drinking and partying. They have plenty of waitstaff to sell you drinks and food but not as many to do anything else.  Besides it is too crowded for the staff to keep up. 2. The staff training appeared to be focused and compartmentalized. The results is no one can help…",3,
"I just knew we had to stay here when Singapore became an extended stopover on our family holiday. Our room was large and comfortable and overlooked the bay. The rooftop pool was awesome, sometime crowed and not deep but the views of Singapore, amazing!! Yes it's expensive, but overall Singapore is expensive! Even if you can only afford the stay for a night or too, then transfer to Sentosa!! ",5,
"We stay there last week as part of our honeymoon trip around asia, the hotel is great looking but too busy. I get shocked when have to wait nearly and hour in a line for check in??? Had a feeling im waiting at airport check in for busy flight. This is unacceptable for 5*hotel, the managment have to find solution to with this and the lobby to look not like airport. Otherwise the staff was great and friendly, they decorate nice our room with a city view. The room was spacious and nice. The pool area is great attraction with amazing views, the problem is you cant find a place to leave your stuff, all sunbeds full with people and horrible busy and noisy area with a wall of selfie people around (not like pictures in medias) Anyway we had a great time and continue around asia :)",4,
"A visit to Singapore begs at least one night in this iconic piece of architecture.  After booking a non-refundable room at another hotel, I had the opportunity to spend an extra night in Singapore so OF COURSE I booked into the Marina Bay Sands for that night!  While the observation deck and two of the restaurants are accessible to the public, the swimming pool is not.  This is what motivated me, I have to be honest.  Just wanted to see the city over that infinity edge.   I must say therefore, that the pool experience is somewhat marred by people taking selfies, but if you can ignore that, just the location of the pool is very special.   Food and drink service.  Towel service.  Beds half in half out of the water, if you choose those.  Hot tubs on the other edge, amongst dense…",4,

"Used the Marina Bay Sands as a day room due to a long layover between leaving our cruiseship and departing from the airport. The hotel would not let us book the room for the day so we had to pay overnight which worked out expensive but we wanted to stay in this Iconic hotel.  Communications with the hotel were excellent, I explained by email that I would only need the room for the day and would be arriving at 10AM, they did explain that check in time is 3PM but they would try to acomodate and in any case we could leave our luggage and use the infinity pool and skydeck located on the roof.  We arrived at around 10 and were delighted to be told our room was available, great.  The room was fabulous. located on the 38th floor overlooking the ocean and the bay gardens.  The room had…",5,
"Looks good, feels good, a masterpiece of civil engineering. The casino and the shopping mall are separated from the hotel by a walkway. Guest rooms are huge, and the views are spectacular. Efficient service and the amazing pool on the roof, makes this more than a hotel; You must visit this icon at least once.",5,
"We spent an evening at the Marina Bay Sands for dinner and taking in the view. It is jaw droppingly beautiful! It's hard to stay focused on walking in forward when you are busy looking all around you taking everything in.  The highlight was by far the rooftop! The rooftop is 57 stories up and has a huge infinity pool and bar/food. The food and drinks are expensive, but it was what we expected for that kind of hotel.  If you plan to go for sunset, be sure to go early so you can try to get a table. It fills up quickly once the sun starts to set. ",5,
"we spent 2 nights in marina bay sands and it was a great experience.  the pool ***** the staff ***** the club 55 ***** the room *****  the building itself is already amazing, but also the people working there will assist you 24 hours.  casino / mall / gardens of the bay.. you can spend 2 days only for exploring the area around!  we come back!

"Would highly recommend this hotel to anybody travelling to Singapore.   Rooms were nice and comfortable with a pick the 360 views of the city from the rooftop and The infinity pool.   One complaint, checking was very long Which is a shame for a hotel of this Standard.   The food at the hotel is okay. Tried the steak which was pretty average. Breakfast was nice.   Made our F one weekend even more better as it felt to be part of the experience. ",5,
"So, I haven't actually stayed at the hotel as yet.  My friend and I had a room booked for this Saturday 25th for one night.  Therefore, my disclaimer is that I am not reviewing the hotel, which I presume to be great place to stay.  I suspect we will be re-booking for the re-scheduling of our holiday to January 2018.  A minor gripe I had was that for some reason, they need 48hrs to change the name on the booking.  My friend and I were unable to fly out to Singapore and have had to cancel and reschedule everything for January.  Booking.com had indicated that we were past the cancellation date and so we'd have to pay the price of the hotel.  Of course, I was disappointed I was going to be taking a hit in the wallet so thought someone may as well stay in the room and wanted my…",3,
"Went to stay here with my friends for 2 nights. Really great experience! The hotel was really fantastic and beautiful overlooking such a great city view! The hotel room was luxurious, big and really clean with a good amount of supplies (eg. towels). The staff were also friendly and quick to assist us. The night view around the area was also really amazing! The infinity pool gives a really great view of the city and is really fun :) Definitely worth your experience!",5,
"What to say about this incredible place. We arrived at tower 1. Got our keys to the room and then already you got a feeling of your stay. Really nice rooms !  On the 57th floor you will be surprised ! What on earth made the architect putting trees, a huge pool, bars, restaurant and sun chairs om the top of the Hotel. Infinity pool was more than great.  Enjoy and have a unforgettable moment.",5,
"We stayed for just one night in a club room as a treat while in singapore   The room was wonderful, on the 49th floor, with a balcony and garden/sea facing  The lobby check in area is busy as already said but worked fine.  We got into our room for two pm and headed for the swimming pool - our main reason for staying here.  It was everything we hoped it would be, the views are a amazing.   In a club room you have access to afternoon tea 2-4 in club 55, which was delicious, and with excellent service and views. You also get access between 5-7 for drinks and canapés - champagne and beer etc - canapés is really an understatement with mini shepherd pies, chilli crab, etc we did not need an evening meal afterwards and instead watched the gardens by the bay light show from our balcony…",5,
"We only stayed here for the pool. We don’t like hotels this big and it was expensive for a high rise room with city view and no breakfast but we wanted to see the pool. It wasn’t as bad as we had thought it would be. Check in was easy, nice room, quiet and clean. The pool area was busy but we were able to get loungers. It was a nice atmosphere up there. We had expected a party loud atmosphere but were proved wrong. All in all glad we stayed and experienced it.",4,
The main issue I have with this hotel is the long check in! And the waiting time for check in is too long at the Sands Lounge as there are limited counters inside. They should continue to keep it exclusive for VIP guests. When we were there to check in at 2pm but they told us our suite was not available! We had to sit and wait for over an hr. We were there to celebrate our 11th Anniversary but the hotel did not even acknowledge. We celebrated with RWS and they sent a bottle of wine to our room.   Requested for extra bath amenities and the housekeeper brought us the regular bottles they provide in their deluxe rooms instead of Roberto Cavalli for suite rooms. I had to send him back to get the right bottles.   The pool is usually very crowded. Dont expect to have a nice swim. It…,4,
"If you want to have an outstanding accommodation, choose one of the biggest hotel around the world! The room was huge with luxury amenities and city view(26th floor and higher is the best choice), everything was fantastic, the professionaly staff was there to assist you! The facilities, mall, casino, gardens by bay, art science museum everything located around the hotel. It has also more than 20 restaurants. Last but not least the infinity pool at the 57th floor give you the opportunity to have a 180 view around city! Definitely highly recommended for your next experience!",5,
If you are staying in Singapore for a few days then you must visit this hotel. It’s extremely good and although expensive the infinity pool is exceptional. Staff were very friendly and helpful and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,
"We had an excellent stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean, I always love when robes are included. Wi-Fi was good throughout the hotel and the infinity pool on the roof is a must see attraction when visiting Singapore. We ate at one restaurant within the hotel which was quite expensive, however this was to be assumed as it is a luxury hotel. Location was excellent and we were able to walk over to the garden by the bay as well as have easy access to the metro.",5,
"We stayed at the Sands for 2 nights with a group of 6 people. When you arrive, the hotel is spectacular with its lobby and check in counters. We were on the 17th floor with the Gardens on the bay view. It was amazing. The infinity pool is out of this world as well as the bar and nightclub. We had an amazing time but it was ruined by the bellboy who get us a taxi who charged us 50 Euros to go back to the airport. My other tip is we did not book any breakfast buffet because it was way too exorbitant and rather ate at the bakery of the hotel. One of the whoaaa factor hotel in Singapore.",4,
"We kept 'should we/shouldn't we' thinking when looking to book a hotel in Singapore.  When we first arrived I wish we hadn't.  The receptionist was robotic and either didn't recognise or chose to ignore our disappointment when our pre holiday request for a room as high up as possible was greeted with 'your booking only guarantees a room between floors 2 and 9' and then proceeded to give us a room on floor 5. We were unaware of this restriction and, to be fair, if id known, I would have sorted it with the travel agent before hand.  But, she would consider any discretion.  Floor 5 is lower than the roof of the mainly underground shopping centre next door so there seemed no point in taking that. We ended up paying an upgrade of S$77 per night and were given a bay facing 42 floor…",5,
"I've always wanted to stay at the big boat and decided to spend the money for a night. If like me, this is a once in a blue moon type booking, opt for the club rooms and take advantage of the 'Club 55' afternoon tea, evening drinks and breakfast buffet.  Also, as we only had 1 night here, we spent all of our time inside to fully enjoy this amazing place.  By inside, I do also mean the roof top infinity pool. Poolside drinks were a staggering $50 for 2 but sufficiently laced with alcohol.  The room was beautiful, no signs of wear and tear. The staff were professional. A great stay.",5,
"Definitely this hotel lives up to the hype!  We make a book directly to their website and able to receive a voucher from Adrift bar for 1-for-1 Cocktail drinks which located at the lobby and available from 6pm to 9pm.  Making the booking directly, the Hotel offers a 10% off body massages and selected spa retail products, if any of you interested.  We got a Premier Room and couldn't be more than satisfied. Though it may look too spacious but the room makes us had a comfortable stay.   Sadly we are not able to enjoy the Infinity Pool due to bad weather but we are able to just witness the amazing view from the top; despite the heavy weather. Hehe.   Truly an amazing stay and experience we had there and will for sure come back again.  PS: Do take note that every last quarter of the…",5,
"i stayed here for 2 nights and had the marina view room with a balcony. the hotel is all about the views and the amazing architecture. The hotel is a complex with gardens, casino , restaurants, bars and shopping mall. i enjoyed the experience but was also glad i hadn't booked any longer as it is very crowded.",4,
I recently stayed 2 nights in a Premier King city view room . Very comfortable & great views but lacking in warmth. This was my 2nd visit and found the hotel too busy and impersonal. Value for money would rate a 7/10 although Singapore as a whole is quite expensive. From spending $59 for lunch in Haji Lane my favourite meal was $5 for Duck & rice in the Maxwell St hawker centre. ,4,
"What can I say.. the pool is amazing!  If you are staying in the hotel in order to do the pool, do it :)  The hotel itself is very impressive.  The lobby is a huge space, and underneath and adjoining there is a great mall and food court, as well as the casino.  The room is huge, even by American standards.  I was on the 47th floor with a city view, and it was an amazing view.  The bathroom and all room amenities were top-notch, and no complaints... we had a sitting area with its own TV, as well as a TV in front of the bed.  Then, the pool... you've seen it on Facebook, and you need to do  your own selfie too.  It feels amazing as a pool, and then the view is breathtaking.  I am afraid of heights, but I never felt nervous.  So, no worries there.  In short, there is alot of hype…",5,
"This was my second stay at the Marina Bay Sands and I have to say that I was not nearly as fascintated as during my first visit, 3.5 years ago. This time, Singapore was our final layover returning from Australia and 2 nights at the MBS were supposed to be a special treat. Again we stayed in Tower 3 with a city view (still every bit as impressive), on the 43rd floor (of 57) this time. I don't remember if our bathroom was as huge and completely impractical last time as well or if we had been put in a wheelchair friendly room, but it was very strange that the bathroom was huge but completely lacking (with the exception of a tiny board around the washbasin) in storage space for washbags, toothbrushes, etc. Also, the basin was placed uncomfortably low for me (I am 1.70 metres in…",4,
"Overall: A great stay with tip top service provided by the staff. A little bit crowded but if you haven’t stay here before, you can try it at least once. Location is superb! Will come back again!  You  Room :-   Pros: I have booked a suite (with city view) during my stay.  The suite was huge with ceiling to floor glass windows. Stunning view.  There’s a pulled out sofa bed which was lovely if you’ve kids traveling with you or another adult.  Clean room with a safe.  Huge bathroom (with separate shower & toilet)  Bath tub is separated too.  You are able to view the light show from your room at night.   Cons: The TV in the bedroom was not working.  Water pressure is not that strong for shower.  There’s no bidet (even for suite) which is ashamed   Check in:-  Pros:I’ve arrived in…",5,
One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in! Fantastic room with free wifi and the legendary rooftop pool! Simply my favourite spot with a fantastic city skyline view! I loved the wonderful breakfast at RISE restaurant.  Will come here again!,5,
"I think this hotel is at least one time experience when you are in Singapore. If you decide to stay at Marina Sands Bay, take the upper floors, there are amazing views. Pool is very nice, open until 23:00. All of the people make photos and selfies (even me), because of the views to the city.",5,
"My partner and I stayed for two nights on our way home from and Indochina trip. It was so relaxing and very convenient as you don't need to leave with everything so close by. Staff that we dealt with were fantastic, friendly and helpful.  We arrived very late on our first night but we asked for extended check out and then were able to store our bags and use the facilities on level 55 for a shower before flying out which was great.   Our room was cleaned immaculately when serviced. The buffet breakfast at Spago and Adrift was delicious.  I will be back one day hopefully!",5,
"We stayed here for 1 night as a treat on our last night in Singapore.  Arrived in a taxi and our luggage was checked in separately. We were ushered to the VIP check in area as there was a small que at the main check in desk.  The reception was so lovely and seemed really interested in our trip, she even gave us an early check into our room, as www arrived 3 hours before check in time.  We had a twin room facing the Gardens, which to our surprise, had a balcony! The room spectacular and all the fixtures and fittings are beyond the average hotel.  We watched the light show from out balcony which was amazing.  We ordered the English Breakfast to be delivered to our room and we got so much food, fruit, toast, jams etc. So much choice! It is an amazing hotel and well worth a stay,…",5,
"We have been stayed at some of the top 5 or 6 stars hotels. My husband and I are impressed with Marina Bay Sands in any aspects. We stayed at room #3792 for 3 nights. The housekeeping team did a great job- clean, organized and almost dust free. A special thanks to the housekeeper Lady Yu. The service and the food selections in the Club Lounge were excellent! We couldn’t ask for anything better that that! Great food, great wine and especially the superb service. With such a big hotel, we actually check in & out both within 5 minutes! Definitely recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,
"Stunning property, pool level, bar and restaurants not to be missed.  Very large property with lots of different shops / restaurants to keep the kids entertained. Complimentary upgrade for a return visit to a stunning suite, couldn't have asked for more.  ",5,
"A few years ago I saw a picture of an awesome infinity pool overlooking the impressive city skyline. It looked so cool, that I decided to see this place with my own eyes. When the stars finally aligned and I was going to visit Singapore, I naturally wanted to stay here, but some reviews of the Marina Bay Sands made me doubt. People complained about long check-in lines, hotel being too crowded etc.  Being unsure what to do, I even considered staying here for 2 nights and 2 nights at The Fullerton Bay Hotel, the highest ranked hotel on TripAdvisor. Eventually decided to stay here the whole 4 nights and booked a club room for the best possible experience.  In the end, it was the right decision. The hotel is definitely crowded (including the club area), but once you get used to that…",4,
"I made the mistake of not booming early during my first visit to Singapore a few years ago and wasn't able to stay until this time. The extra money was definitely worth it for the fantastic service and experience. As a guest you have full access to all of the restaurants, bars, amenities, and the roof top infinity pool (with amazing views in all directions). The hotel was definitely more expensive than the places I would normally stay at but tue restaurants all seemed reasonably priced. I had the breakfast buffet at Rise in Tower 1 which had many western and Asian options and plenty of seating. There are plenty of things to see and do in the general area of the hotel and it's close to the MRT and anything else a guest might need. All in all it was well worth a visit and I would…",5,
"Even though the property is really expensive, the quality of the room is impressive and the infinity pool is definitely a main feature of the hotel too. There is definitely a WOW factor here. The property is located in a very convenient area and it has lots of shopping and food and beverage outlets around the hotel. It's pricey BUT the quality of the hotel backs it up.",5,
The hotel/mini city overall was incredible! The infinity pool is worth it alone. The views are once in a lifetime and completely worth it visiting Singapore for if nothing else at all.   My only negative to mention was the front desk told us we had breakfast for free with one of our two rooms at check-in. They echoed this when we went to breakfast twice! Then when we went to pay they charged it to our room and when we went to check out they wouldn’t remove it from our bill? I filled out a form to dispute one of the two breakfast charges (meet them half way) and haven’t heard anything. Maybe a miscommunication but a unnecessary blemish on a otherwise great hotel stay. ,4,
"Was a really nice hotel, great views of the marina and convenient to get to the shopping centre but not sure if I would stay again, due to the price.   I think this is a must see hotel, just with the size and amazing pool deck but I wouldn’t stay for a long trip.   Pool was breathtaking, with great views over the city. Was pretty busy but that’s understandable considering how famous it is.   Reception was pleasant when checking in and out. Room cleanliness was immaculate, absolutely no complaints about the hotel/ stay other than it was pricey.",4,
"It is undeniable that Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is one of the top hotels in the world. The moment you enter your room, you will be greeted by the Gardens by the Bay followed by the sea view. It’s infinity pools and rooftop SkyPark allows you to enjoy the great view of the bustling city skyline. What’s more they are free for guests, including its fitness center. There’s plentiful to shop and eat around at MBS Shoppes. You can also go anywhere in Singapore with the mass transit train (metro) station at its doorstep.",5,
"The room was stunning, with a beautiful view to the trees.  the infinity pool, which you can only access if you are a hotel guest, is just incredible. Unfortunately a lot of people there. The choice you have in this hotel is just so incredibly large that it is hard to choose where to eat/drink. Everything was top notch.",5,
"Had an outstanding time. Everything was over the top in a great way - amazing service all the way from the airport to the airport when I left: limo service, management escorting me to my room, fast room service, amazing views, and of course the convenience of the mall and surrounding areas. A never forgettable trip!",5,
"No doubt about it this hotel lives up to it's promises. Stayed for two nights in a suite on 39th floor. Superb views across the bay to The Fullerton and great views of the nightly laser show. Our package included breakfast and  canapes plus endless drinks from 5-7pm, champagne for us flowed continuously. The views were stunning, the food and drink superb, service excellent. During the day we lazed by and in the infinity pool at the very top of the towers where you could order food and drink as well as enjoy spectacular views. There are also numerous other places to visit such  as g gardens by the Bay, only a stone's throw away. If you are heading to Singapore you must treat yourself to a little bit of luxury, worth every penny.",5,
"One of the best hotels and conference center on the earth. 3 huge towers for hotel and 3 big halls for shopping, conference and casion.",5,
"I have been to Marina Bay Sands before, not to stay ( simply can't afford this luxury ) but this time bringing our Adult Children for a family holiday to Singapore. I love the Architecture of this Building itself and for my kids to see that truly amazing view from the top, and again was not disappointed nor was the rest of my family. We walked all through the inside of this amazing building and slowly made our way out and up to the viewing platform on top of Marina Bay Sands. ( Cost AUS $45 ) which is worth every cent. We were all just Captivated by the amazing view of Singapore. Make sure you go on a clear day for the best viewing of the City, a side glimpse of the Marina Bay Sands Infinity Pool, and take some amazing photography of that view. You can purchase Souveniers and…",5,

"Awesome hotel!  My husband and I were lucky enough to get upgraded to the Orchid Suite with city views, from a Deluxe Room.  The room, staff, facilities were all perfect!  The pool, although a little cold, was everything I thought it would be - the view!!! Amazing!!!!  Now planning another trip back there ",5,
"We stayed in a Club room for three nights on the 45th floor with city views. Such an amazing room and the views were simply outstanding. The gym is excellent as is the unique infinity pool on the top floor.   Club55 was a terrific venue for complimentary/club breakfast, afternoon tea and free-flow champagne and canapés 5-7pm. The staff in every venue were polite and friendly and we enjoyed the drinks promotions in Adrift cocktail bar. ",5,
"This hotel is all about the views!!  Everything else is just average. Food, rooms,shops,and just about everything else is greatly inflated without being any better than some 4* I have stayed in.  Breakfast was good with good selection, My room was the suite which at over $700 per night could have been better. It just felt like the decor was kind of not really that modern.  The hotel is huge, but because of this you don't really get great service. Most staff were friendly but lack of hotel training of staff certainly lets this place down.  Drink prices were scandalous , pool was not really that clean and just too many things not up to scratch, I think it all boils down to the fact that the hotel is that big! It's more like a shopping mail than a hotel.  They also charge a deposit…",1,
We just stayed for one night. The view from the infinity pool is incredible. The rooms are quite spacious with amazing view. The bars at the rooftop are very nice and very busy.  The elevators get crowded during peak hours . Overall an excellent experience.,5,
"We stopped off here for a couple of nights en route from the UK to Australia and so glad we did. From the moment the taxi driver dropped us off to the moment we left Singapore I was amazed at the beauty, architecture, style and elegance of this structure. If you've read any of my other reviews you will know that we are well travelled around the world, (the Americas, Caribbean, Europe and the med) and have a daughter who has Autism and special needs so we carefully research destinations beforehand.  Practicalities; Check-in was easy even though there was a small queue there were numerous desks so we only waited 3-4 mins. Room was as described and expected and overlooked the bay from where we could see the evening water/light show. Everything worked as it should and no noise was…",5,
"This hotel is as luxurious as it gets in Singapore. The infinity pool alone is worth the stay, and the $500 you'll shell out for a nice room. Modern hotel with great view of the city and of some awesome gardens. Enjoy !",5,
"From checking-in to checking-out, you'll know why this hotel is an icon for so many reasons!  First, the architectural design is uber iconic! Along with its quality and service.  Second, a buzz is everywhere even if you don't go to the casino!  Third, has its own theatres and shopping mall with hundreds of shops and restaurants.  And, of course, the iconic SkyPark with its infinity pool.  Don't go home without a swim here!  Kudos to all those involved!",5,
"Well the hotel itself does not need my review or anyone review when it comes to the beauty of this hotel, its infinity pool the views. Having said that, the thing to comment is their service , 10/10 receptionist, concierge and all staff around are just awesome, very helpful, always welcoming and respectful. Their internet connection is 10/10 everywhere- rooms- lobby- restaurants ...  highly recommending this hotel ",4,
"Stayed in a King Club room which gives you access to Club 55 and the Infinity pool.  The positives of been in a club room are twofold, firstly you don't have to stand in that awful due for check in as you have your own private check in area with refreshments. Secondly you have access to the pool which is iconic and the only reason you should stay here.  The negatives are it's huge so service is lacking due to the number of guests that need serving. Club 55 is rubbish, the afternoon tea is not afternoon tea. It's more like something you would expect at an all inclusive in Benidorm. For the evening drinks and canapes we were waiting for half an hour to be seated as the club 55 is far too.small for the.number of guests especially when they are offering unlimited cheap sparkling…",3,
"Hotel itself is very beautiful but confused with 3 different towers, Nice and Amazing swimming pool with food facilities, friendly F&B staff who is working in the restaurant in the swimming pool - room is fine with good facilities and nice view to the Garden by Bay.  I arrived to the hotel after 5pm in the evening as my classes in university finishing at this time, my friend check in in proper check-in time at 15:00pm, as per the international rules and regulations. Here we go! Asking unnecessary information which is not related to work flow, keeping me waiting in the reception for more than 30 min for no reason, need guest to come down from the swimming pool with is on 57th floor and recheck in me.....

We arrived around eleven in the morning and check in is at three pm but no trouble the just let you store the luggage and give you the passes for the roof pool.same for leaving you have to vacate the room by eleven am but again they will store your luggage while you carry on and will let you use the showers in the gym if you need usefull as our flight home was eleven at night.

This is an absolutely beautiful hotel!!! It's my first visit to Singapore and I was surprised by the location and service. It comes at a price but depending on how you like to live it could be well worth that money,5,
"My friends and i stayed here for two nights and we were given a room on the 22nd floor with a balcony facing the amazing view of Gardens by the Bay so we were very happy with it. Our room was very spacious and has a nice interior. Bathroom is one of the best i saw in hotels. The only thing missing in it is a bidet but other than that, it's a very nice bathroom. Below the hotel is the marina bay high end shopping mall and restaurants. And on top of the hotel is their infinity pool where you can see the entire Singapore when you swim at the edge. The pool has an amazing view. You can also go see the entire city of Singapore better at their observation deck. Hotel guests are free to use the pool and observation deck but walk-in tourists are only allowed to go visit the observation…",5,
Booked a room at cheap pricing through my friends manage to get the room to view National Day fireworks and great day to spend in the hotel!   But one downside is with the infinity pool that only allow 2 person to enter if you're with your family. ,4,
"I highly recommend this Hotel in SG, stayed there for just a night, but also our last night in SG,  well,  they say: "" Save the Best for Last"", and it's worth it, spending our last night in MBS is a Best decision we made! From the Concierge, to the Luggage Counter, and FnB outlets. The Room is very Cozy, viewing the SEA, and  Gardens by the Bay SUPERTREES!  E VOILA' , staffs are very friendly and welcoming, gave us the right information we need . Visiting Singapore won't be Perfect without staying here. ",5,
"U have to stay in MBS once in lifetime-location/hospitality/options to eat,shop,kids friendly,adult friendly,youth friendly!The infinity pool area is to die for,the view and the helpful attendants to guide you for each thing is amazing.The best part is the cute little bathrobe they provide for your little ones if you r staying as a family.Lunch at Rise is also a must for all the non veggies specially sea food lovers:they have a plenty of options and also good spread of veggie's.And when it comes to Desserts-u cant taste them all-they have a ocean for sweet tooth.  Thanks  A very happy customer 😀",5,
"I have stayed here for the second time, and things have improved.  Last time I felt as though it was a bit impersonal.  This time even though we didn't book a suite, just a standard room, the service and attention was more welcoming.  Staff smiled, and said hello, nothing was too much trouble, and some had the time to have a chat.  The quality of the rooms was still 5 star, and the facilities were top notch.",4,
"Soooooo disappointed about Marina Bay! Far too overpriced for what offer! Hotel is super chaotic, reception and halls are always like a market! Swimming pool at the top is like a pond, too overcrowded and so shallow....  Bedroom so noisy, we could not sleep - we were at 40th floor.... Bed linen smelled of alcohol (guessed used to disinfect, but still....)  Staff not really helpful, and the restaurant Chinese at the ground floor was appealing... even found a hair in the plate!!!!  Really avoid avoid avoid!!!  ",1,
"Amazing hotel regarding architecture. The swiming pool is really crazy and the view from there incredible. If you are à swimmer do not expect to be able to swim. It is for me just a spot to see and to be seen for some poeple too! Anyway, when you ignore that, the hotel is clean, services are very good, staff well trained and skilled and the room are big and very comfortable. We stayed one night with my husband and we will keep a very good memory.",4,
It’s a beautiful hotel in a very luxurious setting. The views from either side -city or garden side are great. The rooms are quite spacious. There several restaurants in the property. The highlight of course is the infinity pool on the top floor.,5,
"We stayed for here for one night at the end of our 7 day trip to Singapore. We booked a King Room but were upgraded to a suite on the 53rd floor. It was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Staying in the suite you get access to a private elevator which only the guests staying in the suites get to use. Once arriving on the floor we went to our room there were only three other rooms on the same floor. The suite is massive with a lounge room, dining room, small gym, powder room and a bedroom with a large bathroom.

"The Pool with its view and the experience to be one of the privileged ones is the asset of the hotel. Besides that an upper Middle range hotel experience. Designed to be a five star property rooms and Services do not fully meet it if you look at with a open eye view. Remember we Talk about a really big property.  Starting with few storage place for clothes, no mirror for those using the hair dryer as requested in the room. Ladies will miss facility with sufficient light in the bath room. No Master swith for light and finally suboptimal doors with a gap between door leaf and floor so that noise from corridor will find its way into the room. Design is state of the Art. Pool area is fantastic, towels and Drink Service as well as plenty of funny guests included. When it comes to…",3,
"This is my second visit.  Notice some improvement has been done particular of the cleanliness.  However, there are some rooms for improvement too as some stains found on the side of the toilet bowl.  The view was really great.  The limousine provided by the hotel was very good too and services was great.  ",4,
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night whilst recently visiting Singapore.  The hotel is enormous with lots to see & do. Our room was modern & stylish with a huge bathroom.  Our concierge suggested that the best time to visit the infinity pool on level 57 was 6am. We decided to take her advise & arrived at 5:55am to be the first ones in. It was everything you can imagine as we were able to get night shots & then see the sunrise. 🌅   Was definitely a once in a life time experience.  ,4,
"Stayed at the MBS for 3 nights after a 12 hour flight from the UK. This is a stunning hotel with luxurious rooms and stunning views  across the Singapore skyline. The infinity pool on the rooftop is a highlight and obviously very busy.  A high end hotel, although expect high end prices too.",5,
"Five star luxury all the way, however the restaurants and shops are five star prices. I can recommend the DB Bistro which is a seafood restaurant excellent food and service.The rooftop pool is fantastic with stunning views. The staff are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.",5,
"This is one of those hotels that is an icon, it’s almost part of the must do checklist when coming to Singapore! The pool is unique, rooms are incredible and staff are impeccable. Special mention to the lovely staff at Club 55 (worth getting a clubroom to have this included), especially Olga - how you’re able to remember our names after a day with the amount of other guests that go through, I’m not sure. Thank you for making this a lovely trip!  We had two days here and some more on the other side of Singapore (Orchard rd), I’d recommend doing that to see more of the beautiful city as the area is very touristy.",5,
"Stayed at MBS whilst organising a trade show at the expo halls. Very comfortable room with really everything you could need already provided. Obviously the sky park observation deck and infinity pool has breathtaking views across Singapore and the Bay Area, but the various food outlets were also amazing if unsurprisingly pricy. Overall an excellent experience!",5,
"Ok so this hotel is just amazing.  Those giving it negative reviews are probably related to Mariah Carey and will complain about anything.  The room were perfect, the view was perfect and the bathroom was enormous.  And this is just the most basic room you can get.  The in-room breakfast was the most delicious thing you will taste.  Is it cheap? of course not.  But at least you get what you pay for.  The infinity pool is just spectacular and even spotted Venus Williams during the tennis finals.  Hey Vee!  Would come back to Singapore just to stay here.  To make you feel extra special they should have a welcome message for each guest on the TV screen!  Next time getting an upgrade!",5,
"Knowing how hotels run, my standards are lower than the average Joe. However I was assuming for the price that this would be an amazing hotel with equally amazing pool. The lobby was less spectacular than I was expecting. The service to check-in was fast and we were able to go to our room earlier than expected. The room itself was very large, the auto blinds that work with the room key was a nice touch. The bathroom was nice but don't expect to use the mirror after you shower, the fan is basically non-existent. The room furnishings looked a little outdated, I think a more modern approach would have fitted the building better. The bed was on the hard side, I was expecting more luxurious for the price and reputation. Both TVs stopped working at different times during our one night…",3,
"Whilst on holiday in Singapore with my friends, we decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for one night mainly for the rooftop infinity pool, although the pool was amazing it was sooo full all the time and closed at 10:30pm which was so disappointing. We woke up 6:00am when the pool opened to enjoy quiet time in the pool but even then there was soo many people there. The observation deck also closed at 10:30 which was very disappointing as these were the 2 things we stayed in the hotel for and could not make the most out of it.  The hotel room was average, the view was good, we chose a room above 50th floor. Considering what you are paying for the room, I was hoping upon arrival we would be welcomed with complimentary soft drinks but this was not the case, we were only…",3,
"We where during our trip to Singapore one night at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and I would do it again every time. We had the Orchide Suite with city view and it was a very nice experiance. The service was perfekt and very professional. The visit at the Club55 is absolutely a must and a run at the gym with this unbeliveble view is phantastic. Of course a visit at the infinity pool was the highlight during our visit. The pictures which we have taken will be always remember to this great day/night. An further highlight was the dinner at the restaurant ""Adrift"". But here you can read my seperate comment directly at the restaurant. The only thing which was not perfect is, that I had to asked 3 times for the additional third bed and the outfit for the third person. If I book a room…",5,
"Booked a deluxe room for my hubby and I for our wedding anniversary  but to our surprise , they upgraded us to orchid suite! We had a nice time. And skypark view was breathtaking! Will definetely come back with our 3 kids! Hope will get upgraded again! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁",5,
"I stayed here with my partner for a short trip to Singapore. It's a truly iconic hotel and the views from the pool on the roof are stunning, although the water is freezing. Check in was good, however the service we received when there was a lizard in our room on the 42nd floor was far from perfect. We had to wait for well over an hour and make several calls for the situation to be resolved and this took the shine of an otherwise good stay",3,
We had a fantastic relaxing time at MBS. Highly recommended for a great holiday or city stay. Have the buffet in the lobby at least once and spend the rest of time by the amazing pool .Chinatown and little india a must as is Sentosa Island,5,
Will give it 4 stars for that Infinity Pool alone.  The building is a work of art and is a must when in Singapore.  A dip on its infinity pool while overlooking the magnificent downtown Singapore is a better way to spend an afternoon of relaxation.,4,
"Overly expensive but definitely worth at least 1 night stay!!  I and my husband both felt that we were back to some Las Vegas big hotel, having huge shopping complex, nice casino into it. The hotel has 3 big towers. We stayed in Tower 3, in a high rise city view room after paying extra pennies than low rise rooms, but it was definitely worth it. The hotel has two sides - one is gardens by the bay, flyer, marina bay view and other side was having whole city view.. both the views were really beautiful at night.. But I must say Garden View was better which I had chance to see from roof top where Swimming pool was located.  Main Attraction of this hotel is the rooftop Swimming Pool.. only customers staying can access that by individual room key entry.. Swimming pool is all time…",4,
came here Chinese new year 2016. huge tourist attraction and it was a plus to actually stay at the hotel. There's shops across underground it also leads to the lake.  amazing view and it feels you're on a ship.  One of a kind hotel,5,
"just one night here for business trip, and feeling amazing stayed here. all building interior are luxury, ( but room not too luxury i think )  Breakfast at Spago and so many variation of menus, love it And , infinity pool at 57th floor is a my favourite spot ... rasanya betah berlama2 disitu  The minus one : employees are less friendly",5,
"Great place to relax if your on town for a short stopover. Rooms are great, pool and view perfect.  It's a 5 star hotel but don't expect 5 star service! This place is huge and therefore always very, very busy. As said, very good to relax pn top of the roof, to enjoy the view and heading off after 1 night. If you stay longer in singapore and like to explore the city, there are better places (and less expensive ones) on town.",4,
We had an outstanding time at marina bay sands I took my 2 children 7-9 they loved the pool the rooms were above excellent in every way service outstanding definitely would revisit this hotel this place has a big wow factor ,5,
"Let's face it. Everyone here comes for the infinity pool. The view from the top is incredible and hard to beat. But sometimes the pool can be very crowded, even at 6am when we went thinking that we were going to have the pool exclusively to ourselves. If you manage to be around 11am this is actually the less crowded time as this is check-out time and the hotel seems to have a lot of guests staying for just one night. Service and drinks by the pool were very good.   We stayed at a ""superior room"", on the 45 floor and the view to the skyline was beautiful. We were also able to see the light show from our window!. Access to Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum was very convenient. However, there are better luxury options in Singapore. We also stayed at the Intercontinental…",4,
"We stayed st the marina bay sands for 2 nights on our way to Vietnam! I was very excited to experience this renowned hotel! However my excitement was short lived, the staff were extremely rude, the management were unhelpful and the rules and regulations that guests are expected to keep too were a reminder of my time in school. After a full day by the pool, spending over £300 on drinks and food (incorporating the standard 20% service on everything) I was held hostage at the gate because my friend had accidentally taken my room key back with her to the room. It was 5.30pm and you cannot get in without the key and so I have no idea why they created such an issue when I wished to leave. Instead of simply checking my room booking, they insisted I call reception (from my mobile!!!) so…",1,
"As I attended an international conference in early September, I have taken the opportunity to stay at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.  Needless to say, it is very convenient for me to walk to the convention hall within easy reach, and all under cover.  One can also go to the shopping mall and have food at the food court within easy reach.  I stayed at a room with a terrace, commanding a panoramic view of the Botanical Garden. The room setting is really comfortable. For room service, the response was prompt and excellent and the Hainanese Chicken rice I ordered was also hot and fresh.   Breakfast was available in a few eateries, and I picked the one at the rooftop every morning, naturally ventilated, comfortable and I like the food. I love simple and wholesome food, and I can…",5,
"This place is amazing ,my son and i spent two nights here ,the service and staff were excellent .  we had a club room which allowed us to have all the benefits of Club 55 it is well worth the extra money to stay in a club room .The rooms are huge ,we had a city view and were able to watch the light show from our room .The pool and view from the pool is also amazing ,we had no trouble getting a lounge at the pool the time we were there .I would like to thank all the staff of Club 55 for the wonderful service ,we will always remember the wonderful time we had here .",5,
A great place to stay and enjoy the Infinity Pool on the 57th Floor.  What a view !!! The staffs are outstanding and services are truly amazing. I love the high-end stores too.  The building which includes the 3-towers are manificent and the roof top is the WOW Infinity Pool.  We truly enjoyed our stay at the Marina Bay Sands overlooking the Garden By The Bay and the water view is just picturesque.,5,
"Enjoy the windy under the hot sun! Singapore's Most high end Business and Resorts Venue! MBS Marina Bay Sands. Found all type of shopping, entertainment, casino, exhibition, foods, Garden By The Bay ...... Spend your day here, you will feel either relax or stress because of spend too much on shopping 😁   😄 Lobang Queen walk here and there to see see look look",5,
"Great place to see Singapore and get your bearings  You have 2 choices  Go to observation deck for $23 and wander around Or go to roof top cafe for $20🍹, we chose the cafe as you get to redeem your $20 on food or drinks Had a couple of cocktails enjoying the view Very touristy but the view is amazing",4,
"This place is amazing the views from the pool area are brilliant.  The service was great easy access to Marina bay attractions ,heaps of shopping and eating close by . Heaps to do for all the family ,could have done with a couple of extra days here ",5,
"I had an absolutely amazing experience. It has a famous sky pool on top but this can be very crowded so I advise to go later in the night (not too late because the pool closes at 23:00). They take security very seriously so you can only use the pool if you’re a hotel guest. You can also see the water show on one side and the gardens by the bay on the other side, depends on your room.",5,
"Honestly, I stayed here because I really wanted to spend an afternoon at the infinity pool at the top.   Was it worth it? Yes.  Such a cool view of Singapore, good food and drinks pool side, it wasn't overrun with kids (though there was a lot), and to just swing back to my room when needed was great.  All of the food and shopping in the hotel, or connected to it was great, but the easy access to the Gardens by the Bay was what really put it over the edge.   Only downside is that it was very expensive, which I knew going it.   I would strongly recommend staying here a few nights and then finding some of the other amazing hotels in the interior of Singapore that you can easily walk around town from.",4,
"This is simply a majestic, iconic and spectacular hotel in every way.  Seen from practically anywhere in Singapore, it stands as a landmark and one that calls out to be explored.  The huge infinity pool on the top of the 54th floor is an engineering marvel.  Take time to order a Singapore Sling and sit at the outdoor bar and marvel at the 360 degree views you will be treated too.  It is worth a visit for that alone.",5,
"Lovely hotel they've done a proper job , the pool on the 57th floor is amazing food is great everywhere there's a massive mall food courts restaurants everything you could want great base to explore Singapore we loved it",5,
"We stayed 6 nights at the Marina Suite with a pool table. Suit was excellent and big. Room was clean and furniture wasn't too worn out.   Service was very kind and polite throughout. This was real 5 star experience. We stayed later on 3 night at the Pan Pacific Marina, and I have to say Marina Bay Sands is way better.",5,
"This was a very nice hotel to stay at and I would recommend it for the experience however it is no more special than your average 5 star hotel - the architecture was pretty sweet though. The room and breakfast options were pretty standard and the hotel needs much better separation between tourists and guests. The staff and service was outstanding. I'm glad I went to experience it, but I don't need to go again. ",4,
"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  Everything is 'Wow!' and the staff are amazing.  A stay in a Club Room is a must for all the benefits of Club 55.  Looking forward to returning. A particular call out for Ce La Vie restaurant who made my husband's birthday special and all the staff in Club 55, they really are fantastic and very personable.   The rooms are huge and well serviced.  The pool is incredible and there are no words to describe the views from this hotel.  ",5,
"I stayed for 2 nights in Tower 3. To reach my room, I had to show my Room key to the security for their verification and also use the same for accessing lifts. Not clear of the two- step security process within a distance of 10/15 ft. The hotel didn’t provide me any newspaper & I missed reading Strait Times.",4,
"I just stayed one night there because of the infinite pool.   The hotel is not cheap, and the check in - check out times makes your stay shorted than 24 hours (but this happened in all hotels I've been in Singapore), from 3pm to 11am.  We asked for a high floor and since room wasn't ready on time we got an upgrade (Go MBS!!!). We got some water and refreshing towels during the check in, really amazing service and attention. Room was huge with an enormous bathroom with bathtub. The usual amenities.  If you are lucky you could see either the Gardens by the bay night show (sea side) or the bayfront light show (city side) from your room, (you can see it from the ground any other time)  or also you can see the shows from the top.  The pool is from another world, amazing, huge...…",5,
After reading some of the reviews here on Tripadvisor I was a little concerned about the size of the hotel and the apparent queues for everything. We booked a Grand Club room for 3 nights. On arrival we went straight into the Sands Lounge for check in. No queuing and very straightforward. Our room was huge and beautifully decorated. The whole hotel was amazing with fabulous bars and restaurants. You could spend days there and never need to leave. Every member of staff we came across was so helpful and friendly. I would find it very difficult to fault any aspect of this hotel.,5,
"Going to Singapore and not experiencing Marina bay sands is a mistake in my opinion. It's a wonderful experience! Our room was on 44th floor with a great view to city, with having access to the lounge, you don't need to be worried about food and drink. Staff are great, location is great, pool is amazing and room layout and amenities are very good. The only thing could be better was the water pressure in shower and TV system. It may cost you an arm and leg, but worth it!",5,
"We weren't guests at the hotel but wanted to get a view from the top.  You could either go on the viewing platform which I think was about 20S$ (May have been pounds can't remember) or to the rooftop bar for S$22 (check prices) including a cocktail.  We chose the latter! We had a table overlooking the bay.  Absolutely unbelievable stunning views.  We drank at our leisure and weren't hurried along.  We saw the rooftop pool with the infinity pool which is for guests only.  Underneath the hotel fabulous shops, all the designers - just for looking for us. If you are a gambler it has its own casino and restaurant.  Fridays and Saturdays at 8 and 9 p.m alongside the huge Louis Vuitton shop outside there is a fabulous light show with music and fountains.  Unforgettable.  Restaurants…",5,
"wow!!! I cannot describe this hotel... any word will decrease the level of enjoyment I had there... I has spent the entire weekend there after a business trip in Singapore and I can definitely say it was worth the money (and I paid a lot of money). Everything there was well designed, from the smallest details to the biggest ones, so the guest would have get the most of his fun out of his time... and it's working. The roof with the swimming pool and the jacuzi's kept me speechless... the fitness center is something you must try, as it's located in the 55th floor, so you get the widest view while jogging. Will get back there with my family...",5,
"My partner currently lives in Singapore and I was over visiting. We decided to spend our last night in Singapore before headed off to Thailand at the Marina Bay Sands.  We were so excited about staying in this iconic hotel but were left rather disappointed. For $500 for the night we would have expected much much more!   Firstly, the car park is a million miles away from Tower 1 where we were which was a very hot and sweaty walk with bags. The building is definitely impressive but felt more like an airport than a hotel. It was so busy and crowded.  Checkin felt like we were queuing at the airport. They did offer us cold drinks while waiting but that’s what I’d expect for a 5* hotel. The check in staff were friendly.  The overall decor and condition of the hotel was poor given the…",2,
"""First impressions last"" As an individual working in a service sector;it is very important to provide a quality service to consumers.I was warmly greeted by Elaine from the check in counter wherein I mentioned to her that it was my first time to check in. She immediately provided me with the necessary details about the infinity pool, restaurants etc. which I did not ask but I knew I needed to know :-) . I didn't even have any follow up questions afterwards.   Customer service is one of the pillars to a successful business/company. Happy customers  are ALWAYS repeat customers :-) Thanks Elaine ! Thanks MBS ! :-)",5,
"Hotel check in was efficient. We booked the grand club room. Indulged a little because it was our honeymoon. Great for us as we enjoyed Club 55 facilities that came with our room! Hotel gave us a special welcome because it was our honeymoon. Great views from our room! Walked to Gardens by the Bay. Hardly left Marina area. Hopped on Singapore River cruise just at the Bayfront. Infinity pool was definitely a hit but too touristy. Not for swimming. More for a dip and photos. Visited the casino, walked the Shoppes. Wished we could have stayed a few more days!",5,
"My first visit to Marina bay sands, Wow wow wow. When we first arrived we were greeted as we walked in and asked to show our booking, from then on we were treated like royalty. As we arrived early our room was not ready, they took our bags completed the paperwork and advised we would be contacted as soon as our room was ready. We booked a grand club room which came with club 55 access, the views from club 55 were amazing the service was impeccable and this is where we enjoyed  A full buffet breakfast, morning tea, afternoon tea and evening nibbles and drinks well worth the extra cost. Our room, it was like a small apartment absolutely magic, it consisted of a small lounge area separate bedroom , bathroom and even a dressing room. This room is 5 Star all the way you won’t be…",5,
The building is iconic - and that's it.  I was looking forward to staying in this hotel as part of a conference. Other than saying you have stayed in this hotel and gone swimming in the pool the is NO reason to stay here. It is an assembly line hotel.   -Service was poor - basically take it or leave it.  -Problems with my reservation - which seemed to be a common happening as 2 colleagues had problems as well -Breakfast was absurdly priced -Room was not clean - hairs in the sink and a bit of mold -Curtains would not close all the way leaving a gap -Bed was not good - sheets poor quality - mattress was terrible  -AC was not strong enough (or set to never go below 24.5) -Pool was very crowded and water was dirty/cloudy - so my swim was very short.,1,
"The view from the skypark and the pool lives up to the expectations and is stunning everytime of the day. Despite the many guests, customer service is excellent and quick to serve. They let us check-in earlier, check-out at 13:00 and even left a birthday cake at our room for my birthday. Rooms are simply albeit luxuriously decorated with great views of the marina bay. Would definitely stay there again!",5,
"This was a dream of my life - to stay in this hotel and eventually it came true. The hotel is huge, it's like small city and to my taste is a bit crowded (due to its popularity and size). But everything rest is fantastic - infinity pool, fantastic cocktails and breakfasts on the roof bars, excellent service and anything else, you can imagine. Nearby area and wonders are amazing and impressive. Thanks for the chance to be here.",5,
"The garden view of the room and the swimming pool are wonderful.  Location: big shopping mall inside the hotel, 2mins walk to the mrt station, not even need to go outdoor.  Eat: some fine dinning restaurants in the hotel and in the mall, there is a food court inside the mall as well.  Lobby: the ceiling is so high, many sitting area, it is crowded with many people.  Service: upgraded by front desk at tower 1, forgot her name, but she smiled all the time and very kind. Then I lost my room card at swimming pool and the front desk at Tower 3 was helpful.

Overall rating experience  85% /100 %  Price : Price starts $380++ up to $600 depends on the season Comparison : My Honest Opinion I rather spend a night @Marina Mandarib Hotel (adjacent to Marina Bay Sands) where you can see the best view as well and for as low as $200 ++ a night.   Receptionist Service : 80%  MBS became tourist attraction and felt like im doing a favor while checking in   MBS Skypook : Limited to # of person per room so its like oh okay (limiting #of person in the pool)   Room View : Great view if you’ll get city view . But great as well if you’re getting Gardens by the Bay ,4,
Nice and clean room with a great “garden by the bay” view or the city view. They have the great infinity pool and bar in the rooftop. In the lobby they have nice restaurant especially ADRIFT (should try their skewers “pork collar” and “ox tongue”),5,
"The MBS is a luxury hotel with a fantastic swimming pool with a view.  The room and facilities were great.  It is a bit away from Singapore proper, but taxis are cheap and  it is is also serviced by the very efficient Singapore MRT (underground).  Next door there is a convention centre/shopping mall with good eating options and on the other side is ""Gardens by the Bay'.  One piece of advice is if you want to take in the view over a drink, avoid the trendy and popular bar on the 57 floor next to the pool, and go down to the 55th floor.  Or just order  drink whilst you are lying back on your pool lounge after a dip.    My only other criticism is that it is all a little impersonal, but I guess 2500 rooms will have that effect.  All around an experience not to be missed - if you can…",5,
"Went here for lunch...and the view! 2 club sandwiches, a non alcoholic cocktail and a Diet Coke S$96 (£53)...the View was amazing and the food was exactly as described and plentiful. It is a must do when in Singapore...the engineering is incredible to achieve this. Looking at all the ships in the bay as far as the eye can see...you have to see it to take it all in....wow is an understatement.    Would I want to stay here? I will be able to answer that on another visit!!",5,
Stayed here for our recent visit. Great hotel with excellent service across all departments! However it’s the pool that is the biggest draw Card and well worth the experience- a tick on the bucket list for sure! Worth a stay just for that pool! Plus great choices of F&B places and loads of shopping just footsteps away!,5,

That was such a nice place and many more things there to do. It will be convenient for you If you roaming around this place by Bicycle or Hover-board. The perfect time to go this place is usually afternoon and before the sunset because at that time you will get some outstanding snaps also 📸",5,

After we returned from day trip, items had reappeared in a visible spot. Thus, the original thief, management who took complaint and the person sent to our room subsequently are all involved. Scam hotel.",1,
"Amazing views from the top, can even see Malaysia in a clear day. The hotel lobby/shopping centre is very plush, very expensive shops and really reminds me of a Las Vegas hotel complex. Had a few cocktails in the outside bar at the top, which was lovely but, be warned, you enter the bar from the prepaid viewing deck but, once in the bar, you are not allowed to go back out on the viewing deck. So do your sightseeing first before going in for refreshments. ",4,
We stayed just one night in this hotel and absolutely loved it! Incredible views from the rooftop bar and gorgeous cocktails! The rooms are huge with fantastic views over the bay. It's very expensive but well worth it for just one night!,5,
"this review is based on what we experienced during our 2 nights stay.  Prior to our arrival, i send an email to the hotel to informed that we our traveling with my PWD mother in law.  I requested to have an early check-in for one of our rooms.  Their very responsive to my email so i can say that their reservation team is pretty attentive to guest queries.  We arrived MBS around 11:00 and being assited by the receptionist in tower 3 name Julie ( a korean ).  She managed to find 1 room ready at that time since she  is aware that im travelling with a PWD.  Even though the other room will be ready around 14:00, she managed to get my email adress so their team can send a confirmation email once the other room is ready.  Overall, the checkin process is smooth, but could do better if…",4,
"The hotel is a spectacular 3-tower structure built by Las Vegas Sands. That Las Vegas is behind this is immediately clear upon arrival at the lobby driveway. Loud music to welcome you. The reception is a very long desk with many staff behind it and a queue in front. Once you get served it is very difficult to communicate with the receptionist in this cacophony. We were told the room would be ready at 3 p.m. and suggested to go up to the pool. Here we waited, but not until two phone calls later did the room become available and we entered at 4.15 p.m. Fair to say that on my request we were allowed a late check-out 3 days later. The room is spacious and contains all that you may expect in a hotel this level. We had issues with a light, with the climate control and a…",3,
"We attend a conference based in the conference centre across the road from the hotel. Staying here avoids taxi availability issues, and offers the opportunity to escape should schedules allow. However it is really a tourist hotel: the atrium is huge, the infinity pool an attraction in itself. Rooms are large, comfortable and functional - views either out to sea or back over the city itself. As well as a tourist attraction, the pool does offer opportunity for proper exercise. Breakfast buffet at Rise is reliable, though queue can take quite some time. Didn't try breakfast at either Adrift or the top floor options.  Always debate whether to stay in other hotels for the conference, but have no comparator. ",4,
"Have stayed a few times in MBS and always enjoyed the convenience of the local, accessibility and the amenities nearby.  The rooms are big and both the garden and city view rooms are good. Lovely toilets. Excellent menu and quality cooking for room service which I always ordered.   Love the gym which is well equipped and has excellent view.   Pool is ok, go for the view but not when you want a good swim/workout/relax. Too many pple there only for posing.   Always nice to take a walk after dinner at the nearby garden by the bay. ",4,
"If you are planning to go to Singapore and is planning to stay at a hotel, Marina Bay Sands is where you stay at! It's not cheap but if you could make it work I'd recommend that you go for it. My trip to Singapore was 4 days and I stayed here for 2 nights. I spent a couple hundred US dollars per night during my stay. The receptionist was friendly enough to get us upgraded for a nice view of the bay. The rooftop pool was a topnotch! It has excellent view of Singapore, hands down. I heard it can get crowded up there so I went in the morning and avoided the crowd. I also recommend trying the RISE buffet at the 1f, they have plenty of choices and really good breakfast buffet. If you have time and money, planning a trip to Singapore I'd spend it here. If you want to experience…",4,
"Before we arrived at the Marina Bay Sans, we stayed for 3 Nights at the Pan Pacific Hotel and since our stay was incredibly good and perfect there, our expectations at the Marina Bay were the same or even higher!  We arrived at the Marina Bay at 1 pm. We know that usually check-in starts at 3 pm, but since we were already there, we decided to do check-in, storage our luggage at the hotel and in the meantime we visited the Gardens by the Bay...   The front Desk was a pure chaos and took ages till they call the next guest on the line, the queue was getting bigger and bigger and everything was really slow and many people were even getting upset.

This place is huge but personal, the staff where terrific and very helpful. The highlight is the sky pool, what an amazing venue, with restaurants and bars close by. Of course the place was spotless just like Singapore itself. Easily accessed by train (which I recommend) or taxi. Most efficent check out I have ever had with it done electronically. All in all a great experience, if we go back we will stay here again.",5,
"It was my dream to visit Singapore and particularly Marina Bay Sands and yes, my dream come true! Amazing hotel, unbelievably impressive, excellent service and here some tips for all of you who are planning to visit this place: 1. The hotel is really huge and all the three towers are checked-in and checked-out by one reception. The staff at the reception desk is slowly in the check-in process, at least compared to the five stars hotels service in Europe (despite the fact that we have online check-in made in advance) and you should have this in mind, to be patient. There are rush ours at the reception, when it is getting really crazy. We have checked at not so busy time, around 17:00 and we needed 30 minutes; 2. If you want to order something from the room service, please have in…",5,
Fantastic hotel with an iconic pool. Make sure to be in the pool for a superb laser light/water fountain show. We stayed in a club room giving access to Club 55 and the food and drink here is so varied and beautifully presented and complimentary with our classification of room. The hotel can be very busy at times but is a must stay for a few days if in Singapore. Truly a bucket list destination.,5,
"The aesthetics of this hotel are amazing. We travelled as family of 4 with 2 kids 6 & 10. Easily the highlight is the infinity swimming pool. Takes the breath away - kids were awaked. we stayed for one week. Room was very decent size, but the second bed was a pull out sofa & as iwht many hotels who take this approach it wasn't a comfortable sofa bed, very thin mattress. We got the hotel to bring an extra mattress for the bed, but still not very comfy. For the amount of space & offering rooms for 4, i think this hotel should have a second decent bed, there is enough space in the room. we stayed in a club room, so had access to the club on 55 which was good in breakfast rush hour as the other breakfast restaurants all had queues about 9 am to get in. Also, club 55 offers afternoon…",3,
"Really loved with this place, is quiet from Singapore most happening place. This place also offers some kind of activities both for kids or family. Then they have a rooftop pools and i think the highest in Singapore.. ",5,
"Came here on route to indonisea, staying one night to celebrate a 50th birthday. And yes looking to take a few pictures tick a few boxes, reading previous reviews we did not expect the service to match the amazing hotel. It did and more, from the moment we arrived, bags taken from you, check in completed in 5 mins, and best of all room allocated early, not 1hr but 6hrs early!!! What a great start landed in Singapore at 7.30am in the room for 9am. So quick settle in and off to check out the pool, again expecting to see a packed out pool and terraces, again a great surprise empty pools and terraces. I guess planning your trip avoid weekends and major holidays for the best chance of less guests. Yes most guests where in the pool to take pictures and pose, but this is not the place…",5,
"If you have a chance you should stay at the Marina Bay sands at least once in your life. Is the staff Friendly....not particularly, the hotel is so big you are just another number. The rooms are also nothing special. It's the hotel itself...the infinity pool on the 60th(I think) floor over looking Singapore, it's the nice restaurants with excellent food and the never ending shopping. My advice is to go to the pool at 6am when it opens, it isn't crowded and you get the same effect as at night with the bonus of the sunrise in the jacuzzi. By night everyone is poolside for the skyline view. I wouldn't stay here for a long period of time as it is not relaxing but well worth the (three day for us)ride.",4,
"Modern hotel. Beautifully located, with a direct entrance to the shopping center and casino. Fantastic panorama from the rooms. Amazing impressions. The rooms are beautifully decorated, the highest level of aesthetics. Rooms clean. Fragrant. The highest rated hotel in the world. The architecture of the hotel is impressive, it is a work of art. The rooftop pool is an unforgettable experience, a view across Singapore. I would highly recommend. A place to come back.",5,
"Stay again at MBS Singapore.  However there is a problem watching TV programme CCTV 4 channel.    Freqeunt interruptions appeared in this channel no matter it's News time, dialogue talks programme & Chinese movies.  It will stop broadcasting automatically for 1-2mins on News time relating to cross-straits &  movies.  CCTV 4 is a Chinese  international TV station from China which is broadcasted in hotels for travellers to watch their home & international news.   All other channels do not have such problems.  ",3,
"Swimming above Singapore skyline was the reason I decided to spend a night in this hotel. The room rate is pricy but I thought that this kind of hotel should provide top quality in line with its price. It turned out that apart from its pool and its view, it is a rip-off touris trap.   Its check in and out service can't handle the number of guests it has taken on. The queue at it reception is like queue at airports or train stations.   The building quality is shy on details and there are broken and falling pieces here and there. The room is big enough but deco is basic. When we checked in, the balcony was dirty. There were so many people at the swimming pool which made me laugh to think that all of us paid a lot of money to take ""bath"" together. When we booked, we asked for a…",2,
"I was very unsure about staying here as it is such a large hotel. I cannot fault the room as it was very spacious and the view from our balcony was beautiful. The only thing I didn't like is that it is so busy, everywhere you turn 100s of people. The pool was packed all the time. Took us a long time to check in as you have to queue.  The location is good and the mrt station is very close so easy to get places. ",3,
"Stayed here for one night after a cruise around Asia for our wedding anniversary due to the hype and the photos I had seen of their pool online and thought I would treat ourselves to a night here!  On arrival check in was a bit lengthy but the staff were very friendly.  I would have expected some water available or something to drink at check in, especially in such warm temperatures.  Staff said they could check us in early as it was our wedding anniversary (even though a couple beside us checked in early and they never mentioned a special occasion), but it was a very welcomed gesture especially in the heat.  Our room was clean and very spacious with a great view of the city and the light show.  i would have expected the room decor to be nicer, it was quite basic for the price…",2,
"There is not too much to say, its simply the best in organization and customer service. The property is beautiful and its the right place for relaxing time. Who does not appreciate Marina Bay Sands should travel more around the world....",5,
Stayed at the gorgeous Marina Bay Sands Hotel for a three-day trip to Singapore. The location is just ideal. Was a 7-8 minute ride by cab from the airport. Had heard negative stories about the check-in time here but was pleasantly surprised. Our flight landed early morning and we had requested an early check-in. We were told that rooms were not available till 12 noon but were soon accommodated by the thoughtful Mr Justin and Mr Glenn at reception. Checking-in did not take that long and they were very informative.  Had the premier city-view which by far is the best view in my opinion. The view from our room on the 42nd floor was the same as that from the sky park and the pool. The iconic infinity pool at the hotel doesn’t fail to impress. Gorgeous pool with a breathtaking view of…,4,
Just visiting not staying. Beautiful spectacularly hotel. Fantastic vieuw on Singapore. Be there one happy hour otherwise the drinks are way overpriced. 35.00sg$ for a wine or cocktail. The infinity pool is only for residents hotel guests. Bummer.,4,
A must see if in Singapore. Views of the marina are incredible. Lots of great shops and restaurants also. Architecture inside and outside the Sands is amazing. Reminded me of casinos in Vegas including an area that had to have been modeled after the Venetian. ,5,
"The view and property was spacious and beautiful (pool) but the management is over the top! I was told that my reservation included 3 passes to pool area; however, when I got back to the states they charged my credit card, without my authorization for a 3rd person. When I checked out I had a zero balance now I have to go back and forth to get this resolved while back in the states. Also you have to do a lot of running around for value card and other things, where one staff person will tell you one thing and another tell you something different even to get to the pool. Its exhausting! Thought my bday trip was going to go off with out a flaw but thanks to Management, I am steaming!",3,
"Definitely one of my favorite places on the world! I like the views, infinity pool, bar... everything... Literally, from the first second I fell in love in this place... You feel like you are ""at the top of the world"", when you are at Skypark... I go there every time i visit Singapore...  P.S. It is expensive up there... but there is a part where you can go for free, and you can just move around without ordering anything.",5,
"I came to Marina Bay Sands for a conference. For a hotel with 3000 rooms, I didn't expect anything but standard service and would understand such as I'm competing with the rest of thousands of guests. But rating my experience..  Checking in - 5/5 the front desk, a filipina, didn't make it too hard for me despite some logistics that were missed (from my side) during booking. I was even given a high floor!  Room - 5/5 clean, everything works, a room with the view of the garden and part of the race track. All amenities from pillows to toiletries are good.   Turn down service - 4/5. Nothing special, but it was properly done and not all 5 start hotels are able to do this properly.  Breakfast - 6/5. There are 3 places where you can have this. 2 of which I have tried and they didn't…",5,
"My girlfriend and I stayed one night only but what a night! The room was amazing and the view (to the city) even better, especially at night I will definitely recommend to visit it if you pass by Singapore. A real luxurious experience! The staff was absolutely great and friendly!  Hope my path will take me there once more!",5,
"Among other excellent qualities, Wangelin Sun is an expert in making the impossible possible and giving people around her an unforgettable experience. From the moment I arrived, I was treated as special, with innovative, and indulgent room preparations and of course the room itself, going above and beyond anything I’d reasonably expect for the rate I was paying, I was welcomed by Wangelin Sun, PA to the COO and her enthusiasm for what her team had done to surprise me for my stay was infectious. She certainly made me feel valued. I hope she takes it as a high compliment that she was inquisitive in a way that you only tend to get in smaller boutique hotels, she immediately made me feel very special.   Also, having gratis services like extra water and Nespress coffee provided for…",5,
"This is the best hotel I have ever experienced. Besides the architectural vision of intriguing, the inside is even better. As you look up, the design and vision of each floor is amazing. We drove into the front of the hotel and there was so many guests waiting to pick up a taxi or get dropped off. I felt like a movie star arriving at a prestige VIP event. The experience and customer service at the check in counter was very professional. Our luggage was delivered moments after we arrived in our room. This gave us the opportunity to really take in the room and the surroundings. The grand size of the room, design and fixtures were 10 star. The look out was facing the Gardens by the Bay.  It was  a million dollar look out. What more can we ask. Breakfast was amazing at Adrift.  The…",5,
"Very nice hotel, very nice room and friendly staff, but very expensive. But it was worth 1 night here, just to experience the infinity pool. The last 2 nights we stayed in Singapore, we booked another hotel. Our room had a beautiful view: sea & gardens by the bay.",4,
"If you don't mind to splurge once in a way then you need to experience this place as this is not just a hotel, its an experience. Its like an integrated community where you have hotel, pubs, restaurants, casino, convention center and shopping malls. There is also gardens by the bay next door. The hospitality is amazing and don't miss out if you are in Singapore..",5,
"We visited Marina Bay sands July 2016. We stayed in 42nd floor overlooking the City. It is a beautiful hotel and designed with amazing creativity. The concept of the rooms are very basic and common to any business oriented hotel but spacious in comparison to other 5 star business hotels. The service and food was excellent. However the most amazing thing about this hotel is their iconic infinity pool in the 57th floor. The best pool we have ever been to. Great design, amazing view, looks absolutely wonderful for photographs. the best view you can get in Singapore. It was a great experience for us.      ",5,
"This was a dream! Living at Marina Bay Sands when we visit Singapore. And the reality was even better than we dreamt of. The room with a view at gardens by the bay,  a delicious breaktfast and a lot of swims 300 meters high, almost in the sky. Thank you so much for this wonderful time! We enjoyed it very much and will come back again.",5,
Room was exzellent and Service and view Great. The stay was like a Dream. Miss this Pool on the top of the Hotel.,4,
I stayed here for 2 nights. It was incredible. The infinity pool on the 57th floor gave spectacular views of Singapore. Definitely worth the 5* rating. Will stay again if at all possible. I just wished they had single rooms for the growing number of solo travellers.,5,
If you have the opportunity to visit this...GO! The pool is obviously the highlight but it’s not crammed and it’s so beautiful. We got an upgrade to a huge suite and had the most romantic evening. The staff were helpful and immaculate facilities made the stay unforgettable.,5,
"Stayed at the hotel for our anniversary treat and we were not disappointed. We were greeted warmly as we drove in and our luggage was taken care of there and then and not seen again till we were in our room. The reception area in the lobby was very busy as not only guests were there but other public tourist's looking around the place as they have tours in the hotel as they go up to the 57th floor for the view. The receptionist was very friendly and courteous and gave us an upgrade because of our anniversary, giving us a room on the 47th floor. We had a great view of the Gardens on the Bay and surrounding area.  The room was spacious, very clean, comfortable king size bed and all the other amenities that gave it that extra special touch. The lifts in the hotel are divided to…",4,
YES .....before booking I had lots of questions in my mind ....shall i spend so much for a sky park and pool entry ????? will it be worth ????  answer is BIG YES     only after staying we can tell the difference......  its a new icon of Singapore .......where ever u go this building will attract your eyes .... so if you are in Singapore u must visit this place and if possible stay hear.....  right from check in ......to check out every thing was easy & fast.....  we got room on 36 th floor for which we paid for City view Premium room with bath tub........ Tower 1 .....  we was offered complimenty cake as it was our anniversary that day ....we do noteat egg so proper care was taken and offered us eggless cake.....  infinity pool is super ......we have to go and see it.......…,5,
"So we all know the Pool is amazing!!!! The service is great. The room cleanliness is superb.  The rooms are spacious fitted with comfy beds and all the main luxury amenities needed.   The view from the rooms also fabulous as no matter which side you can watch either a harbor or garden light show.   But there are people everywhere in the lobby and foyer.   It's a huge resort so it lacks personalization and attention to detail offered by a true luxury hotel. The hotel does a great job with servicing over 2000 rooms, ever staff member was fabulous. Greatest respect for pulling this off but due to its size it lacks charm. You really do feel like a number.   The hotel has lines for breakfast, the pool is crowded most of the time  and it's hard to get a seat at peak times.   If you…",4,
"Like many others, I booked the hotel purely for the infinity pool and the views. One night in the basic of rooms, without breakfast, and non-refundable was more than my return flight from the UK.  The hotel was not as grand as I expected - it is big, huge, and incredibly busy, but it doesn't have the 5* feel to it.   Check-in was good for me as I arrived late, however check-in around 2pm and there are long queues.  I was upgraded on arrival, which was welcomed, as I saw the room grade I had booked and it was small enough with no balcony. My room had a view over the gardens, and the bed was comfortable.  Getting to the top floor was an art. You could either drop down to the lobby or go up to 14, transfer to another lift to 55, then transfer again to 57.  The pool was as expected.…",4,
This new age architectural building is the jewel in Singapore's skyline. A panoramic view from the top floor and many casinos and hotel in this building. The place has easy connectivity through the metro.,5,
"We chose this hotel for the pool, it’s awesome! Busy hotel and I found the rooms didn’t keep much noise out at night. We had a great view of Gardens by the Bay and the Supertrees night light show. The location of this hotel made it very easy to walk around to visit the city.",4,
"Unfortunately we did not met our expectations. The hotel is overcrowded and people who work there are ""out of order"". Nobody has any answer for any question. Breakfasts are included only in highly costed rooms. The ""iconic"" swimming pool on the desk is a not big place with water which are mostly look and smell as Domestos. Not all elevators go from the first floor to the top, which is quite uncomfortable.  Room was ok, with old furniture but absolutely fantastic view on the garden. Even though the hotel is full of people there were no any noises in the room. The bed,  pillows, and blanket were really cosy. That was the only one good thing there. The restaurants....what to say. Food was so-so, as well as service. Choices of wines are not bad, but I can't say the same about food.…",2,
"Staying just one night because of the big price :D  Maybe it was worth it. Room was big and the views were amazing. And of course the infinity pool and the rooftop were the coolest things. Breakfast was big disapointment, really expensive and asking for gluten free food we got only bread (not even good). Not peaceful at all. So many people and when you want to go to the other towers (for example to the gym or pool) you have to go through the public lobby.",4,
"Everything is just wow. You feel special just being there. We booked the deluxe room and were upgraded for free. Room is so high tech and modern we had fun just discovering all the quirks and hidden bits and bobs. We had a garden view which was outstanding.. watched the garden light show multiple times. Staff are friendly and efficient. Pool is good, view is amazing.   However, obviously it is expensive and it made us feel we had to stay in to get our moneys worth. Check in was late and check out was early, annoying especially since you cant use the pool outside of these times. The tv signal cut out and the wifi on the roof is awful. Being picky - you would expect maybe breakfast included or airport shuttle for the price also.   Still, singapore is a highlight of our south east…",5,
"This hotel definitely has the ‘wow’ factor. The huge lobby is similar to an airport with various check-ins, information desks, restaurants etc. However considering that there are 2600+ rooms here, the organisation of such huge volumes of people is amazing. Our club room check in was immediate and smooth. Our room on 38 floor in tower 1 had such wonderful views over Marina Bay and much of the heart of Singapore. We were treated to easy viewing of the light show every night too! Club 55 is essentially where we wines and dined. It is on the 55th floor of tower 2 so involved lifts and a walk through the lobby which takes a minimum of 10 mins. The lifts can take a few minutes to arrive and seemed to be very hot too. Once in Club 55 the views are staggering as  you have virtually 360…",5,
You pay that price for he view (provided you get a room with a good view) & the infinity pool. Room was spacious & Clean. Bathroom was big & nice. Staffs were friendly.Close to MRT & Sentosa. Easy to find food around. View from the pool was amazing. The club & pool was too packed. couldn't really enjoy it.,4,
"Be clear and honest with yourself: you are paying $500+ for a tick on the 'bucket list' and a selfie in the pool. If you are fine with that, go ahead and book, if you are looking for a little more for your $500, I would suggest going elsewhere.   The hotel feels more like an airport than a hotel, it's astonishingly busy EVERYWHERE. The reception is in the middle of a shopping centre that's just heaving with people. The lifts are ridiculous, with crazy long waits. You are a number on a very very very large conveyor belt - nothing more.   The pool is amazing, no doubt about it, but its packed, all the time, just with people pushing other people out of the way to take a selfie with the view. It's really pathetic actually when you watch it happening on-mass. Lots of people couldn't…",1,
Very busy hotel . It was bit long for the check in . We had a nice room with Garden view which is great at night . Swimming pool was very very very busy not much room to swim in the pool . View is amazing . You get free water in the room and we had a some chocolates too . I would recommend hotel for special occasions. downstairs they have got amazing cake and chocolate shop . ,4,
"The Hotel itself as well as my room, with its splendid location and view are all worth a five star rating indeed.  Also loved how the Mall with the Stores as well as restaurants are only a few steps away.   The rooftop pool is breathtaking & worth the visit to Singapore alone.  But, although what seems to be the highlight and gem of the hotel... the pool area needs a renovation at some spots, with worn out teakwood and hand rails that wobble as you enter and exit the pool.   Showers or showering before entering the pool wasn't mandatory... but then again, during my two visits to the pool, I didn't even see a shower, or did I,miss it ?  During check out, the staff was really helpful offering me a room to relax and shower if needed... because my entire body was full of rashes…",5,
The check-in experience was wonderful. They had a concierge walking thru the check-in line offering fruit drinks on a tray. I had a 49th floor city view deluxe room & it definitely met my expectation. The view was great during the day and at night with the lights. The blinds open automatically when you put your room key in the door to open it.  The decor was nice.  My only complaint was there was a faint smell of sewage from time to time in the bathroom.  Other than that this was a wonderful stay.,5,
"Saw this hotel in a picture by my favorite dancer (Brian Puspos) in 2014, Personally got to see this hotel when I 1st traveled to Singapore in 2016 and I know I just have to get up there in the infinity pool! Did not regret any of my decision! Everyone has to experience it at least once! Staffs have personalities with no attitudes! A memory that I will forever keep and had to experience again in the future!",5,
First of all my wife and I select this hotel for our holidays Singapore. For me as a member of the Ritz Carlton hotels I was spectating the same level of service on this hotel bass on customer review but I think we overestimating The service of customer service at the Infante pool my wife and I was there for a couple hours and not a single waitress approached us and asked me if I will like to drink something I have to myself and get something to drink for our self  That is not a good customer service! Second incident where a the disco In that hotel a 57 floor my wife and I walked in find a table our self it took6 minutes and no one came to our table once again I went to  look for waitress I told her to bring me to beer with 2 cold class and said she bring me 4 classes hot as…,3,
"Wow, what an amazing place.  Excellent service.  The rooms are beautiful.  The pool is amazing, I have never seen anything like it.  Loved sitting next to the pool as the view is amazing the only thing they could do is make the deck chairs more comfortable.  Im amazed that they dont have soft cushions on them.",5,
"We had a lovely stay at the Marina Bay Sans Hotel, the room is such a beautiful design with the high-tech. We love having the drink on the infinity pool and it is very exclusive place to relax it is like a different planet kind of that feeling. We love this hotel and we surely return when we are back again to Singapore. ",5,
"One of the best hotels I have ever stepped in! From the minute we checked in we received a fantastic level of service and our room was simply beautiful. Staff went the extra mile to help us celebrate our honeymoon by providing complimentary champagne and chocolates in our room. Hotel location and facilities are world class, especially the Skypark and infinity pool which offers stunning views of the city skyline. ",5,
Just finished a 5 day stay at the Marina Bay  What to expect ? Its a VERY BIG AND BUSY HOTEL  We went for a club Room deal that included Afternoon Tea and from 5pm till 7pm Drinks and Canapes. We also had breakfast included  Not cheap but a must do i think makes the whole experience that much better. The only negative on the Club 55 is kids are also aloud in   The room Very spacious for 2 with great bathroom and bath :)  Room service is the best i have ever had food was always hot and unbelievably tasty with a huge selection.  But its all about the pool and yes its AWESOME just need a few more waiters attending to the guests and it would have been perfect    9/10 Marina Bay Sands,5,
"it's really sweet that can stay in such a nice hotel for 3 nights. everything was amazing. I have to say the service is much better than I expected, all the staffs are very friendly and seems enthusiastic on what they are doing.",5,
"My husband and I visited Singapore this May. Marina Bay Sands was no doubt the first choice of all the hotels because of its infinity swimming pool. Although the price was at the high end, it was a worthy life time experience.",5,
"This had been on my bucket list for a while, since I moved to Singapore nearly 4 years ago. So when a magazine I work for asked me to cover a conference here in October 2017 (and they offered to pay for my stay at MBS) , obviously I took them up on the offer.  The room was really comfortable and the infinity pool was nice.  Drinks are expensive on the rooftop bars, but I got free drinks at Ce La Vie on my first night anyway, so I wasn't too bothered.  They do require a deposit on credit card, or a cash deposit if you don't have a card.  My deposit was 400 SGD for the 5 nights, and it was returned to me as soon as I checked out.  Would I pay to stay here if it hadn't been paid for?     Maybe for 1 night only.  After you've seen the infinity pool once, no need to see it again. …",5,
"You do pay for I,but you cannot go wrong. From when we pulled up at the front entrance,the staff at check in and the other staff that crossed our paths were excellect. Our room over looking the city was great but a better view from the infinity pool was to die for,but just remember  weekends are very busy.",5,
"This is a hotel for the experience. Stayed for two nights and it's a great place to experience Singapore from. The hotel is riding on the name and visual and roof top pool. For a five star hotel the room amenities are poor and they should invest in these to compete with other luxury hotels. Silly things are missing, for example slow hair dryer, instant coffee in the room. It's 2017 when did you last get coffee sachets in a five star hotel. The room was big but bed is small for the size. Having said this the staff were great and views from the 49th floor would be hard to beat  ",4,
"What can I say about Marina Bay sands? This is a ""must go"" place for all tourist in Singapore. I spend one night in this hotel because I wanted to go the Infinite Pool and I have to say that I totally enjoyed my experience. The staff was totally professional, and very helpful. I would like to come back again to this hotel for my next visit to Singapore",5,
"I was excited and really looking forward to stay at the Marina Bay Sands, specially because the hotel went viral on all social media platforms, so that my expectations were high based on what people were posting from their stay. Beside the fact that the hotel is huge, with three towers, we first had to find out in which tower our room category is locates (this should be mentioned on the booking confirmation and would spare the guests a long walk from tower no.1 to tower no.3, what is a quite long distance). There are two check-in counters in tower 3, whereof only one was staffed (amount of open counters was in no relation to the amount of quests queueing). The waiting time was almost 30 minutes until we finally could start with the check-in procedure. The shift supervisor was…",2,
"If you like huge overcrowded Las Vegas style hotel complexes, then this is your hotel!  Yes sure the infinity pool on top of the hotel gives you great views, but it is overcrowded same like the lobby area.  The hotel rooms give you the feel of a standard 5 star hotel, but again nothing special.  The gym is tiny for such a huge complex and again overcrowded.  You will find many better and cheaper hotels in Singapore and you can always pay 25 dollar to access the skypark to enjoy the views from the rooftop instead of paying for an overpriced standard hotel room.  ",3,
"Awesome experience, a destination in itself. Lots to do with the family and easy to get around to lots of key tourist spots from here. Excellent personal touches from housekeeping staff and also received a little pressie on our return to room on 2nd night, which was thoughtful and appreciated! Room service/In-room dining was impeccable - had the full set up, and easy to get to the Shoppes foodcourt in the same complex if you want to eat something different without having to go to a full on restaurant. Would definitely stay again and the view was awesome. Only one downfall was the check-in and check-out queues took AGES, don't know what they can do about that, and staff did apologise, but seemed to be busy at the front desk 24/7 whenever we walked through lobby.",5,
This one 360 Degree Panoramic View is on a whole different level than the other 360 Degrees i have explored in 30 Countries so far. .. Marina Bay Sands is a on a Whole Different Level. Highly recommended and advance booking will save your time.,5,
