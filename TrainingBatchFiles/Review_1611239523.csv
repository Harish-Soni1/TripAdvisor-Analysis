"I can only say good things about this place.  Spectacular scene, especially the view from the infinity pool was gorgeous. The price is relatively high but for all the service what you get and the very modern and clean rooms, it is justified. They offered me to take a shower when I was already checked out and I had a late Airplane. ",5
"Been there twice! Such a spectacular infinity pool and the room is luxurious decor! This hotel has everything that u r looking for in Singapore, the huge high end mall, delicious food court around the side and casino can full fill your trip in marina bay sand!!",5
"Stayed for two nights and what a hotel. The view from our very large room looking over the sea was one thing, but to use the infinity pool was another. Fantastic views over the city but also the attention from the staff regarding drinks/food was very impressive.  Well worth the extra to go there. Breakfast was self service in the main lobby with an amazing selection of foods. Cannot fault it.  Meals in the area however are expensive so be careful where you eat",5
I just stayed for 1 night with my family coz i just really wanna experience the infiity pool. The guy who helped us at the front desk he was really nice helpful he even offered us a bigger room. The thing i didnt like is book for 1 room and only 2 people and 1 child can accomodate while theres a king size bed and 2 twin bed. I think they should be flexible on this. Infinity pool is worth it the view OMG stress free specially during the morning time I went to swim twice morning and night time to see the view at both time. I will definetely going back.,5
"Had high hopes for this place and was initially dissapointed. We took a flight from Bangkok purely to stay here. When we arrived we were put in a room on the second floor over looking a busy moisy road. We hike back to the reception immediately and asked for another room. The receptionist apologised and offered us another room with a late check out as an apology - we have a 9am flight!!! The place was huge and very impersonal. The pool was amazing buy heaving and very difficult to use and no way of relaxing. We tried to go into the roof bar but were told we had spend a minimum amount of money each to goin there -about £20 each. The surrounding area is very good. Singapore was great, spotlessly clean and the people were fantastic. Wish we had chosen on of the less touristy hotels",3
"You pay for what you get and this is no exception. The room was impeccable, the bathroom a palace, the view magnificent, and the staff very friendly. Be wary of the $14 drop coffee at Spago but do devote as much time to the pool as possible. Would definitely stay here again. ",5
"Stayed a week in this hotel during a business convention. It wasn't my first time in Singapore but first time in this hotel.  I must say that although the Hotel is pricey, you get your money worth.  Amazing views of Singapore from very modern rooms, food to ""live"" for, and the most likely, the spectacular roof top infinity pool in the world.  If you can treat yourself when going to Singapore this is a Must stay ",5
The hotel is a lot like a Vegas hotel.  Connected to a very large mall with very high end stores. Be prepared for very expensive meals and drinks all through Singapore.  Very pretty gardens across the street!  The zoo and the Botanical gardens are also great.  Loved Little India and China Town.  The pool here is amazing!!,4
"It is worth to come here just because of the room and the pool on the roof.  The room on 45th floor in tower 1 was unbelievable.  The view is stunning.  Huge window, all things working well.  I think they need to bring more towels, we were 4 people in the room - 2 adults and 2 children, and we constantly needed more towels, but the hotel did bring every time we asked.  Some of its service people speak only Mandarin and the communication was not always perfect, but some of them had small dictionaries and used them actively.  The pool on top is an adventure.  As a pool to swim, it's nothing special, but it's a great feeling to be there, either on the sunbed or inside the pool and watch the sky and the view.  The feeling is great.    The service in hotel varies.  In the restaurant…",4
"We stayed here for one night at the end of March, having returned to Singapore from a tour of Indonesia.  It was the perfect stop over prior to our flight back to the UK the following day.  Our room was a marina view room and the advertised view, through the floor to ceiling windows, was magnificent.  Downtown Singapore was there in all its glory, from the seaport across to Raffles and beyond.  Very good. On arrival the hotel is daunting as it is absolutely gigantic.  The check in process was smooth and well ordered however.  In addition the girl on the check in desk spotted that it was my birthday, from the passport, and by the time we got to our room there was a complimentary birthday cake (gooey chocolate) and bottle of wine waiting for us.  This was above and beyond! We went…",4
"I paid $550 for a room that is on level 3 with no view at all.  The check in is like an airport, saw multiple people walk off unhappy with the service.  Air conditioning in room doesn't work, have it set on 18 but the temp doesn't go below 24.5.  Food and drinks are outrageously expensive.  Lifts don't work half the time and start going up but then change their minds. You have to catch 2 lifts to the pool of you on level 33 and below. Takes a good 5-10 minutes to get up there with all the stops. People reserve all the good chairs at the pool and don't use them.  Pool is good but I wouldn't pay again to stay here.",1
"We stayed for two nights travelling back to the UK from Australia. We had previously stayed elsewhere in Singapore but were determined to try this one out, and we were not disappointed. Once you come to terms with the awesome size of the complex, it is a fantastic place. The hotel rooms are huge with everything you want and the most amazing city and marina views. The highlight however, is the rooftop infinity pool which was far bigger than I imagined so did not get crowded. The views at night are spectacular with day views almost as good. The attentive staff at the pool were brilliant providing towels and drinks at the blink of an eye. Everyone seemed to use the robes in the bedrooms to travel up to the 57th floor pool so changing was not necessary. The food in the rooftop…",5
"I got a wonderful room facing the sky gardens to myself and my friends got a room on a really high floor overlooking the bay. I mean really there is nothing that I can complain about in this hotel. It is divine. The rooms are fantastic. It is also really really huge so might find yourself walking quite a bit since it also has its own amazing shopping complex. It was good except for the price tag. I mean it is really really expensive. The infinity pool ofcourse goes without saying was amazing itself. Would i recommend it yes, but only for a short stay or longer stays if you have deep pockets. There are amazing hotels by clark quay that are much cheaper and equally amazing.",4
Fantastic weekend spent with the family. Kids had a great time. Lovely pool area. Wide variety of restaurants. The view from the room was breath-taking. Service was prompt and attentive. Staff was courteous.,5
"If you will stay here, you won't care too much about the cost. You will have an amazing view from the top, but for this kind of hotel was very dissapointing that the infinity pool was cold without warming machine. On the top there are a nice bar to visit by night, under the hotel you will have the most fancy shops to make your shopping. And of course, outside you can see from the room the Gardens(January 2014)",4
"The hotel is great at almost every level - the rooms, the view, the pool, employees. And we got a room upgrade that even improved all that! The only thing that could be changed is that early check in is allowed if there are available rooms. This time they didn't even checked.",5
"A huge hotel industry running so smoothly at the best area of Singapore . It has a amazing structure , no exaggeration  in saying that it is a symbol of Singapore . The entire area is worth experience ...casino,  mall inside , food joints inside and near art museum .all well connected . 56th and 57th floor (infinity pool) are real relaxing and happening area . Gym is also very good . Nice restaurants  inside .  But as a traveller I can say it is very expensive place for entire stay of 5 or 6 days in Singapore . Two big problems...big lines for check in and clear your bills while checking out and not enough number of family rooms at proper rate . So when you are with kids you have to take 2 rooms ...and so pay double with staying separate ",4
"One of the main highlights of this hotes is the infinity pool located on the uppermost floor. Their infinity pool has a very nice view. The hotel also has a ""laser show"" during the night. The infinity pool is much better during the night since the building are all lit up. ",5
"We absolutely loved this place. Wow the views blew us away. It is a must see attraction while in Singapore. We took the Hop on Hop off bus and it stopped straight out the front. You can buy the ticket there it from your hotel(which we did) you go up to the 56th floor and the views are magnificent. Just a tip though,if you want to have a drink or something to eat you have to go back out to lift and then go up to ghe 57th floor seemed a bit weird to us.",5
"The only reason not to rate this excellent is that checking in can be complicated because your room can be in any of the three towers and you don't know that until you check in. Otherwise the room was superb, the staff really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and valued guests, and the whole experience was fabulous. The views from the pool are outstanding - swimming on the 57th floor is an unbelievable experience.",4
"My second time in this hotel and I must say that second time was as good as first. Usually you get used to things but this hotel is superb. Rooms are extremely clean and well maintained. Pool on the roof is something, you just want to stay there. As the only minus I can mention long line at the breakfast and too many non hotel guest in the lobby.",4
"It has a stunning view over the rooftop swimming pool where we can see Singapore. I feel either in the night or day the panorama are stunning. I would suggest booking rooms on high floors as the outside view from the window could give a beautiful impression of staying in Singapore. There are two options either garden view or city view. Both are good depending on what sort of looks you like to see.  City view will make you see high rise buildings in Marina area while garden view will show you garden by the bay.  The room is nice. The amenities are excellent as well. The hotel staffs are also friendly. When we need something, we can just easily ring the telephone and they mostly respond it quickly. I tried the room service and found the food were tasty and the price were…",5
"Once I have left Marina Bay Sands I doubt I will remember a single detail about it.  Furniture is modern and uninteresting; decoration is minimal and uninspired, and does not at all reflect the colorful city of Singapore.  $600 gets a dull 13th floor view of the ship channel.  While the Marina Bay area is entertaining to look at for a couple hours, the hotel is well away from the more interesting traditional areas of the city.  Apart from the view from the unique roof, the Marina Bay Sands might as well be a Marriott in Dallas.  The two stars in this review is heavily weighted by value for money.  It is obviously not a two star property in terms of amenities, or cleanliness, which is impeccable.  Basically, if you are spending this kind of money in Singapore you can do vastly…",2
A wonderful hotel Very special hotel has a site that does not like him and has a swimming pool distinctive world And views of the garden also featured And proximity to the cruise And all the distinctive restaurants,5
nice place nice hotel nice view nice people nice service nice moment nice pool  the best spot at singapore the best moment with family  must visit this hotel and place..... expensive with expensive view with family  tempat paling pas untuk merayakan pergantian tahun baru  ,5
"The check in is more like an airport check in rather than a hotel, it was quite impersonal. We ended up getting put on a low floor so decided to pay to upgrade although they could still not confirm if we would get the view we paid for! The rooms are quite average considering our bill came to $800 for one night.   All that aside the pool is truly as amazing as it looks, we were lucky as it was a Monday and not as busy so we pretty much had the pool to ourselves. If you book on booking.com check the night before as you might be able to get an upgrade. Don't attempt the mini bar unless you want to pay through the nose and I would also recommend eating outside of the hotel as our one sandwich with crisps cost over $20.   I would go again just for the pool though!!",4
"Fantastic hotel, main attraction is infinity pool on top floor with views into Singapore. From one side of the building can see floating pavilions, esplanade, Merlin and ArtScience Museum in shape of lotus. On that side can view laser, light and water show at night.  On the other side view onto Sky Park and Singapore Flyer.  Whole complex is huge with casino, enormous shopping mall, multiple restaurants, cinemas, theaters and skating arena. Restaurant next to infinity pool is very expensive. Metro station is 4 min walk from the hotel. Sky Park is short walk from the hotels across the bridge. Sky Park looks better from far away then from the near. Worthwhile to go up to the bar on the top of one of the constructions in the middle of the park (there is entry fee) because of the…",5
"I really only wanted to visit the Marina Bay Sands to swim in AMAZING pool but you have to be a hotel guest to get that privilege... and with rooms being in the very, very expensive, it wasn't an option for me.   I did shell out the $20 to go up to the top on the Observation deck just to the left of the pool to see amazing views of the city and Singapore Harbor. I think it was worth $20 for the views and you can hang out as long as you like. Maybe not worth it if on a budget.  Other than that, the hotel itself from walking through it was very chic and glamorous looking. Very, very vast and Las Vegas like with a built in gondola river or something that you can take boat rides through the hotel I suppose. Other than that, it's a lot of over priced, designer shopping.   I went to…",4
"We booked the Club Room and we got a fantastic view from our room at Tower 3 on 46th floor. we were requesting baby crib for our 1 y/o son, amazingly it came at the same time as our luggage. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The infinity pool is amazing. Breakfast at 55th floor also very good, our kids love our stay at the hotel. Express checkout also very useful.",5
"Stayed the night as a couple. Rooms are as usual all well maintained and very clean, sheets beds all up to top standard you would expect. Rooms are spacious and good, not cheap thou. Infinity pool is really amazing. No matter how many times u could always swim and be amazed. Vegetarian food in breakfast buffet is good with abit more variety than most other hotels. Would recommend for holiday or staycation. The view from the room is just beautiful ",5
"My wife and I stayed here for nights in a room on the 43rd floor, the room was a good size with a separate lounge area and a terrific view. This is a bustling hotel with many rooms spread within the 3 towers, there is always people checking in and out any time of the day or night. The pool on the 57th floor is truly amazing, with a unique vibe and amazing view, this is not to be missed. You get free access with your room key and it is always busy, we decided to go up there at 8am one morning for a couple of hours before heading out to explore Singapore and expected it to be empty however to our amazement it was already three quarters full. That goes for the whole hotel, people everywhere. There are many dining options within the hotel, we had cocktails at Adrift lounge one night…",4
"This is the four times i visit MBS hotel,, first visit stay for 2days, second for oneday, third for three days , and the four times stay for oneday... I'm always choose MBS when i visit Singapore,, How many times my colleague said there are no worth it stay there ,, i don't care,, i'm still choose Marina Bay Sands,,, because MBS always makes me feeling Prestige, Premier, Success while i'm enter the lobby hotel,, I love that feeling,, I love watching people around there,, All are in confidence , busy, and love the staff with a style,, and don't wait too long while checkin ,, The staff is really polite ,skillfull and friendly,, Last visit,, they upgrade me to a more large room with a very beautiful view in the morning,, really amazing,, I'm always choose premier room,, cause…",5
"We spent two amazing nights at Marina Bay Sands and loved it.  We opted for a Club room, so check-in was a breeze as we by-passed the other long queue.  From there it was a quick (well almost quick - I chose the wrong elevator the first time and only got to floor 20 - but after that it was quick) zoom up to our room.  Awesome views awaited and we were suitably wowed.  Then we went up to the Club room for drinks and canapés and even more fantastic views. The service we experienced from check-in to check-out was exceptional.  The room price was high, I thought, but for two nights we believe it was worth it to be able to say - Yeah, been there, done that :)  And we are glad we did.",5
"One of the best hotel in the world, the staff make you feel like a King... Really.. Very comfortable rooms, clean ...Fantastic!! The arch. Of this building is amazing. Gardens by the Bay... You must go.. Very modern and nice city.. You can walk with no fear at all... Clean. Simply the Best!",5
A truly TOP class hotel however somehow the 5 star exclusivity and privacy is sadly missing.  Highlight must be the roof poolside. With awesome city view.  Restaurants were tough to book. Due to their brisk business.  Overall I wud say a good experience for sure,3
The lobby is crowded with people during check in/ check out period. We never expect the room is so big (because most newly build hotel is small) and it's also comes with a bath tub. Nice room over see Garden by the Bay. The hotel also provide free WIFI. My little girl loves the swimming.,4
amazing hotel good site staff are excellent they upgrades my room because this was my honneymoon near markets .different ways of transport the room with nice view amazing pool every thing was excellent except restaurants were expensive to me,5
"Club Room in 40th floor with fantastic city view. Amazing Infinity pool in 57th floor. Great service and very friendly staff. Very expensive place to shop. Decent size food court, different food options to choose.",5
"My friend's grandparent's friends had a free hotel stay and decided to let me and my friend have it! It was for Marina Bay Sand's Premier Room. The room was really lovely! My favourite part of the room, besides the view, is the HUGE bathtub! I don't have a tub at home, so it was nice to relax in the bath on the first night.  The only problem I have with the room, is that the shower knob was hard to turn when I was showering. (Hands were wet, no friction)  check out my facebook page and blog for more photos and a room tour. (link in my profile)",4
"The focus of this hotel is definitely the views - whether it be from the room or from the infinity pool at the top of the towers! The room itself was lovely, clean, on the 37th floor and with views out over Gardens by the Bay which were stunning late at night or during the day. My partner and I were able to book dinner at CÉ LA VI, which has an incredible menu coupled with incredible views. We followed this delicious dinner with a late-night trip to the infinity pool. I was worried we weren't going to be able to get beds but there were beds, as long as you went looking for them. The pool service was lovely and we enjoyed a Singapore Sling while overlooking the city lights. The only thing we thought was a shame was that the pool definitely wasn't clean. Express check-out was…",4
I stayed at MBS in March 2016 for a conference. Both the hotel and conference facilities were great. Very friendly staff in all the facilities within the hotel and conference complex. Rooms are modern and very clean. Views are stunning both day and night and there is plenty to see and do in the area surrounding the hotel itself. Pool and sky deck were amazing. Will definitely be back for a longer stay.,5
Amazing hotel spread between Gardens by bay n shopees. Booking is tough. Went there during September  F1 night race.  The view from the top floor rooms is amazing. Avoid September October period as it russhy russhy due to F1 guest and celebrities.,5
"Beautiful hotel and amazing views!  We live in Singapore and treated ourselves to one night at MBS.  The pool was very pretty, though it can be crowded with picture takes at high points during the day.  Great pool side food! Some of the best that we have had.  The rooms were exceptional and perfectly clean with very comfy beds.  Room service food was mediocre, so I would recommend eating at the poolside or one of the many restaurants in hotel. The staff were all amazing and very helpful.  You do have to carry your room key around with you and to get to the pool, but seeing as how the general public can access the top, it makes sense that they do this since you are paying for the pool more or less.  Wonderful stay!!",5
"Worst customer service for a hotel with more than 2 stars. Actually I've stayed in complete dumps where at least the staff can be polite and friendly.  I was travelling with three others including a two year old. It was difficult to get connecting rooms. We spent ages trying to get them to confirm we'd even be in the same tower, but they were very clear they won't confirm we have connecting rooms, I don't think they would even confirm being on the same floor. It's always nice to know that your stay in a hotel the next day might significantly separate your family.  Before checking in I went to sign up to be a member. The one counter was closed with a guy standing right there. The best he would tell me is he'll open ""in a while"". He didn't look at me when he did finally open. Not…",1
"Overall i love my stay here. Great room, staff, swimming pool and shopping mall  But what amazed me here is the hotel security team  Due to my negligence i felt to leave my mobile phone in my room floor. I just realised that i left the phone on my room when i make a trip to mbs art n science museum. Then i checked the phone on the room to found it somehow not there. I simply contact the hotel room service regarding my situation and told me to update if they found and news regarding my phone. I scared its thrown away with dirty towel by cleaning service.   To be honest i never put to much hope that the hotel security will find my phone again. Amazingly they manage to call back after 2 hours and said that they found my phone around art and science facility.   Once again thanks to…",5
"Marina Bay is what you call 'class all the way' Its the place to go if you want to feel flash and expensive... all the way to going to the 'skypark' in your complimentary dressing gown :-)  There is a 5 star shopping centre attached to the hotel, complete with Casino and train station, and the botanical Gardens across the other side.  Warning about the shopping centre, you WILL NOT find any Bargain shopping it is Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Rolex, Gvenchy, Bvulgari alllll the way  Event eh food is expensive 5-star stuff.... sheaper shopping can be found at Harbour side (towards Sentosa Island)  Whilst generally the service was very good... front desk service was annoying including the fact we had to keep getting the cards re-programmed and you can't go anywhere without them.  Sleep…",4
"I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights and all I can say is wow! I contemplated booking this hotel as I saw a lot of positive and negative comments on here, however in saying that I am glad I booked this hotel. The check in service is quick, I was given a free room upgrade to the 42nd floor with a city view which was amazing! The pool itself is what brings everyone to this hotel, it is always busy with people taking photos so don't expect to 'swim'. There are also plenty of chairs and the view is spectacular!  THE POOL CAN INKY BE USED BY GUESTS STAYING AT THE HOTEL. The fitness centre is great & by staying at this hotel you are also able to get a discount at the celebrity chef restaurants.  I will be staying here again if I return to Singapore. ",5
"From the curtains that open automatically when you enter the room to the large marble bathroom to the view from the balcony and the sheer size of the room compared to the Singapore average, this hotel stakes it's claim as a cut above the norm..... but then so is the price!    Needless to say the bed is very comfortable and all the facilities and amenities are high spec. However, due to the sheer size of the place, the service is polite and pleasant but impersonal. It is worth joining their free loyalty program just to get free upgraded wifi and there are other benefits as well. Also worth requesting a high floor.  The much vaunted roof top infinity pool is huge and the views are spectacular. It also has a child free section which is a great idea. That said, it is more of a…",4
"We wanted to spend a night in this hotel as a treat as we live locally and have always fancied a visit. We booked two rooms so my father in law could come with us to act as babysitter and as an extra treat we booked a very expensive spa treatment. The spa in the hotel is lovely, the service is great, the treatments are great and I really couldn't fault it. Unfortunately the rest of the hotel is a massive let down. The lifts are vastly inadequate for a hire of this size. Every time I wanted to go up or downstairs it took around 5 minutes to even get a lift which was always very full and sometimes too full to use. They have a ridiculous and under informed policy at the pool whereby every guest, including small children must carry a room key to access the pool. As a family we…",1
"By far, this has to be the most panaromic view of the city at night from the top most floor ofthe hotel where it boasts the world's first infinity pool, roof top bars and fine dining restaurants.   Not staying at this hotel when you visit Singapore would be your greatest regret.",5
"Re-visited this hotel, hotel service as never change, rooms are good and clean, but they're food at the Rise restaurant, standard as drop (e.g. not much of a choice to choose from in the lunch time), the food court in the area is more like introduction to local food at a high price (so foreigner please be awere of it). For shopping there is like if you have a lot of cash to throw, so buy your thing else were, unless you cannot find the item you want in Singapore, good luck on that.",5
"The hotel pool and views from the room (city view) are breathtaking. The basic deluxe room is massive by Singapore standards and looks ""fresh"" rather than most dated ones in other Singapore properties.  For a hotel with 2,500 rooms it is remarkable how quick in room dining, concierge etc respond to room requests.  However in my view this is a one time ""been there done that"" / bucket list tick off type of property. I stayed for 2 days and felt the amount spent was a whopping amount considering as a tourist you spend most of the day outside.  However for Muslim travellers, please note halal eating options around the place are very limited - only Texas Chicken and McDonalds are halal certified and both are based in the cloud forest / super tree grove area and a 15 minute walk in…",4
"Ok, so before I start I have to say one thing: I read a couple of reviews and some people were complaining about all the tourist, everything being crowded and the noise. If you are expecting to have a relaxing vacation at the marina bay sands, then you are just stupid. This hotel is well known all over the world and people are coming from everywhere.  The check in process was great. The lady at the counter couldn't have been nicer. She also gave us an upgrade. We had a wonderful room in the 42n floor facing the city. It was spacious, very clean and had a nice interior design. I really liked the bathroom.  The pool is busy almost at every time during the day. Make sure to go and see the sunset. There are enough chairs so there is room for everyone.  The casino is huge and it's…",5
"I booked this hotel to experience that amazing looking pool.  The view is incredible but you risk being taken out be a selfie stick when you and hundreds of other people all cram in together.  With 2500 rooms (waiting for lifts was tedious) this place is a machine like a finely tuned production line rather than a place with warmth that you want when on holiday.  I came, I saw but I won't be back. ",2
"This was the definition of misleading advertising: the prices shown on booking.com did not include 10% ""service fee"". I don't blame booking.com since it was indeed written in fine-print, but I find awkward that a serious hotel uses such practices.  Internet was average, it disconnects often and customers need to type in the password many times.  We couldn't use the pool in the last day, which was unkind of them. It could have been a inexpensive customer relation boost.   Overall, it was a good-3-star experience in a 5 star hotel.",3
"My family and I stayed here for a few nights for Holiday. As a member of hospitality industry, I have nothing to complain about this hotel. 5 Stars rating but have 7 stars facilities and service. The pool is fabulous! We had amazing morning swim with the sun rise and beautiful view over the whole city. Cocktails and dinner were divine at the roof top restaurant. The staff had everything we needed. two minutes walk to the garden, and all the great shops just underground to make the whole stay enjoyable and convenient. We will definitely come back again!!",5
"The view alone made our stay very memorable.  Accommodations  were very good, the rooms were clean and comfortable.  Having a choice to have breakfast at the roofdeck, the coffee shop at the ground floor or at their big buffet was good at providing options for different types of travelers( especially for us since we were with children). The views from the pool were breathtaking  although the pool itself can get pretty crowded at night. Lots of people taking selfies in and around the pool.",4
"we stayed 2 nights in this hotel, we had a terrible time with the heat in the bedrooms. we were moved twice in the first night at 9pm after travelling 23 hours and again at 5.30am, they just couldn't get the air conditioning in the rooms below 23.5 degrees in the first two rooms, the air con units were obviously undersized for the size of the room. the engineers did everything they could but agreed that it wouldn't perform as it should other than that it is a splendid hotel, great restaurants, great views",3
"Great location and stunning views from the rooms and pool deck.  However.....  As a Sands loyalty member I requested a quiet room on a high floor at book in, emailed before we travelled to re-request and then asked again at check in.  We then found we were assigned a 3rd floor room with views of the motorway and the noise to match.  When I called reception to request a room change I was told it couldn't happen 'same day'.  After speaking to a superior we were eventually assigned a quiet room on a high floor - however this level of incompetence from the check in staff really wasn't expected.  Additionally the mini bar had previous users food left in it (mini bar not cleaned / restocked for 3 days) and the shower mat was filthy dirty and mouldy.  The pool is stunning however sadly…",2
"It's the best hotel I've ever been to. The view is amazing.  The swimming pools had astonishingly cool water in the morning. Sunrise at the top unforgettable, especially with partly solar eclipse.  Rooms very large, bed comfortable, bathroom with large tube and shower. You get a personal key card as a hotel guest and you have to have it nearly everywhere because the top is open for hotel guests only. Some view platforms are opened to non-guests agaist a fee.",5
"Big. Flashy. See-and-be-seen place.  Good for one night.  It seemed like it took forever to walk anywhere just like Vegas.  Casino has non-smoking floor which is nice.  For the rooftop pool, it took us a while to discover there was an adults only section which would have been nice to know.  The staff are really awesome and clearly want you to have a great time which was lovey.",4
"I stay 3 nights at MBS for a conference. It was fantastic. Beautiful and large room. Attentive and efficient service. I had a city view room, the view was ""ouah"".  I recommend if you have a conference at the MBS or somewhere near the CBD. Easy access via the MRT.  The negative points i may mention is the mini bar prohibitif price as well as the room services. For the rest very good standard from check in staff, bell boy etc.",5
Wow some expensive shops top brands enormous prices but great window displays   We visited here on the way to and from the casino. I suppose if we had struck it rich @ the casino we could of safely stepped into some shops. The Ferrari shop was amazing with full size models of their GP cars,4
"The hotel was very big, modern, sophisticated and cool. the infinity pool was amazing, we can see so many view from this hotel: city view, merlion view, garden by the bay view and singapore flyer view. the mall under the hotel was very complete. this is absolutely one of the best hotel for both business and leisure.  unfortunately the bell boy were not really helpful and the receptionist was very busy because of too many visitors. and too bad there was no bath tub in my room (for that price)",5
"The Marina Bay Sands has quickly become an iconic symbol of the Singapore skyline and is apparently the most expensive building ever built. Singapore has hundreds of great hotels, but very few have made as big an impact as this one. It is a big, busy hotel - very organised and business like with all amenities on tap and is perfect for business or pleasure.  The hotel is only a few years old and well-maintained. There are entries at both ends of the complex, with choice based on which tower - of the three - you are staying in (else the walk is longer!).  The No 1 bestest [sic] thing about MBS is the swimming pool on the roof. It is a 150 METRE (500 foot) long infinity pool. A third of the pool is for adults, a third for families and a third for people taking selfies with all…",5
"Had a fantastic 3 night stay here. The pool is amazing, we were lucky it was that packed the times we were there. The view is amazing, the staff are so friendly and helpful. Couldn't have had a more amazing time. Yes the cocktails are pretty expensive, but we knew it was s treat ourselves girls weekend getaway.  Will definitely be back ",5
"We stayed this hotel after Ritz Carton, but it is also nice hotel as well. I felt like I was in Las Vagas, which means that this hotel is such a big hotel and especially the Pool at the top (54th FL.) was just awesome. ",5
"We actually stayed at the Marina Bay Sands twice as part of our honeymoon and on both occasions our stay was absolutely wonderful.  Our first stay was for 2 nights, we had booked an Orchid Suite with access to the club on level 55.  We landed in Singapore at 7.30am on a direct flight from London so had been travelling for an awful long time.  We thought we would head straight to the Marina Bay Sands even though check in was not until 3pm.  We arrived shortly after 8.30am and the hotel could not have been more helpful and accommodating.  We were able to check in right away and were personally taken to our suite on level 24 in tower 3.  We had a city view and it really was wonderful.  The staff could not have been nicer.  The first day, after a few hours sleep we decided to take a…",5
"We stayed  in a Premier city view room for 4 nights and we were not disappointed, we requested a high floor and they accommodated us, with views from the huge window towards the Singapore skyline breathtaking. The room was as you would expect from a 5 star hotel with electronic everything and all the trimmings. The iconic Skypark infinity pool is something else and must be visited by anyone going to Singapore. The service while laying on the lounges by the pool for drinks and food was never to far away. We have been to Singapore twice before and have seen most of the sights so most of the 4 days we spent in around Marina Bay. With all the theaters, shops,  restaurants, Casino (which is also worth a visit), Garden by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer all within walking distance.…",4
"Having not been to Singapore before I decided to treat me and my partner to the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and push the boat out and book a suite which was very expensive. When I arrived I was not disappointed by the stunning room - it was gorgeous. I then went up to the roof to use the pool and expected to see something like in the pictures which is a serene calm pool but when the lift opened and walked out was hit by hundreds and hundreds of people and screaming kids. There was no room around the pool. The next morning I went for breakfast and again it was total chaos, it was hectic. After queuing for 5 minutes for an egg I gave up. So the crux of it is this. Stunning room but if you are looking for some peace and quite this is certainly not the place for you. Thinking…",2
"It was a fantastic experience here. From the check in where I was upgraded to the Suite which was surely 1000 sq. ft. apartment if not less. The swimming pool on the top gives you a panoramic view of Singapore. A must to enjoy it at night. Not a casino one so the pool and the room were the place I wished to be.  Got the late check out with no extra cost. Over all, It was a superb one.",5
"I know this is a top hotel, but there were little bits that bugged.   Not being able to use the pool after you checked out, whilst you waited for your flight.  A distinct lack of seating in the foyer area.  Having to re-enter details for the WIFI.  And beer was a bit too pricey.  But the pool is spectactular the restaurant is amazing.    The check in staff, are useless.....  honestly.  Most incompetent people I have ever met.  Room service was average.",4
Well this is one place that you cannot afford to miss. Be it the 56th floor skydeck which also has a restaurant or the 57th floor infinity pool. You get a nice view of gardens by the bay. The 56th floor sits at over 200 mtrs and visitors gets a mesmerising views. better to visit after dark for a formidable views. Also the shopping complex adjoining the hotel has some of the most sought after brands. There is also a light show near the hotel which starts at 0930 pm.,4
"We had a 10 day trip to Singapore and had a special treat for our anniversary with one night at the Marina Bay Sands.  It was great, from the moment we arrived by taxi, someone was there to take our bags, direct us where to check in.  Check in was a breeze, quick and easy.  Everyone was all smiles, and very friendly.  Even though we arrived way before the check in time, our room was already available.  We went straight in.  The concierge was fantastic, brought our bags straight to our room.  Gave us a tour of the room, best place to watch the sun rise and set and how to get to the Gardens By The Bay. Our standard room with garden view was huge compared to others we stayed in. The Infinity Pool was amazing.  All those pictures you see - that's exactly what it looks like.  Way too…",5
"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights this past January on our honeymoon and it was incredible.  It was a dream hotel stay so we splurged and got a city-facing room on the club level.  We weren't quite sure what that entailed, but found the club lounge and included breakfast to be well worth the extra expense!  You can craft your entire day's meals around the lounge schedule because they provide breakfast, morning snack, afternoon snack, and happy hour - all of which are an open buffet and have plenty of food to fill up on.  Happy hour includes free alcohol as well!  We obviously enjoyed the infinity pool on the roof and took what seemed like endless pictures of the view, but everyone else was doing the same!  We would definitely recommend a couple nights here to anyone…",5
"Not so spectacular. Overall, I think this is still one of the must-see hotels in SG (just the view from the pool alone seems to make it buzz worthy). However, what is special about it is only the pool and the only to access the pool is that you have to be the hotel guest which will cost you a lot/ night. The room for the hotel is REALLY big for SG standards but it doesn't look that fancy for the price you are paying for. As fr-for the location, I will say that if you come to SG for the first time, it's a good location to walk and see the night shows at Marina Bay Sand itself and Garden By The Bay (which is really nice) because they are within the close proximity. However, if you have been to SG several times, you know you can choose your hotel somewhere else.",3
"We only stayed one night at the Marina Bay Sands in order to have access to the infinity pool. I was not disappointed: it's one thing to see it from bar or observation area, but it's something else to swim towards the other skyscrapers feeling you're about to fall over! Do it only once in your lifetime but do it! :-)",4
This will always be my favorite place in Singapore. The views in the rooms are so amazing! I always love falling asleep with the Singapore skyline as the last thing I would see. And their pool at the top deck! It will always be as gorgeous as the first time I saw it. Lovely lovely place!,4
Stayed here for 2 nights in a premier river view room. On arrival we were taken up to level 49 tower 1 top level. The room was absolutely amazing the bathroom well we wont even go there! The view with floor to ceiling windows as we watched 1 night from the light show beautiful. Then the magnificent rooftop infinity pool. We had buffett breakfast downstairs with everything you would expect drinks in the main bar. We enjoyed the wonderful experience of this amazing hotel.,5
"We stayed for three nights at the Marina Bay Sands and had a nice room facing the Gardens by the bay. The pool is amazing BUT due to the fact that there are many people I expect that a five star hotel will clean the area regularly. The mini tables next to the sunbeds were very dirty, dishes were not collected and on one day the toilet was broken. The breakfast is ok but the service horrible. We had breakfast one time at the rooftop and the other times in the restaurant. In both places they forgot our ordered drinks and the tablecloth was dirty twice (not changed from the guests before). In my opinion that are no-gos for a five star hotel.",3
"The hotel is a mega-resort and quite impressive. Architecturally it is beautiful. The infinity rooftop pool and the view from the top is dramatic and the best part of the hotel. It is a very busy place, and service is quite impersonal. Management staff has good service and are friendly but most service staff are not very helpful. Had high expectations, but left a little disappointed. Overall, we didn't have a bad experience, just not a great one.",3
"The marina Bay Sands Singapore is Very Huge and Excellent Hotel in Singapore. We Just Had Business Group n the Marina Bay Sands. We Enjoy With the Food, Rooms and Other Services of the Hotel. Staff is very Cooperative and Helpful With Very Guest. ",5
"The pool is spectacular but it can be very windy and we occasionally saw food items blown into the water - especially the crisps which come with the club sandwiches!!!  Our room was fine but we had originally requested a family room on level 2 - which turned out to be rather horrible - it had one pull down be and the two single beds were both ""rollaway"" beds.   The family rooms are also located directly above the main lobby so was rather noisy.  We changed to a different room and it was more comfortable and had a better outlook.  The hotel is HUGE and lacks intimacy and atmosphere.  It is conveniently connected to the mall and the MRT.  The mall itself has various dining options some of which can be quite pricey.   Besides being close to Gardens By The Bay is nice, but you do…",3
"The location of the hotel is convinient  it's linked to a mall which gives you access to several retail shops and restaurants. The rooms are clean spacious with a spectacular view, you have either a city view or a garden view (I had a garden view).    I booked a treatment at the Spa and it was really good, I booked it on the same day and the receptionist tried her best to find me a slot. The view from the treatment rooms was spectacular (City View).   The infinity pool is must try it has a breath taking view. on the other hand I felt that the pool is overcrowded which makes you wonder how clean is the pool.   I Highly recommend that you watch the sunset fro Sky 57, it has an amazing ambiance and wonder view at sunset. Also PIZZERIA MOZZA is a must have it has the best pizza I…",4
"My wife and I had a two night stay in a Deluxe room. The hotel had always been on our bucket list, mainly because of the fascinating infinity pool. Although our room was one of the cheapest in the hotel we were very pleasantly surprised when we first opened the door into a spacious, immaculately appointed and presented ninth floor room looking out over the gardens to the bay beyond. If this is the cheapest room in the house it's hard to imagine what the most expensive must look like. We had a ringside seat for the nightly gardens light show with the background lights of the dozens of moored ships a permanent spectacle. The hotel is in a good location with many attractions close at hand. The gardens are only a stone's throw away but surprisingly, it is a bit of a rigmarole to…",4
"...but come cashed up! This hotel is amazing and has something for families, couples, and friends. Spend most of your time on the roof, obviously - world's highest infinity pool is pretty fabulous. Although, I recommend doing something else between 3-7pm when the pool area is absolutely packed.  Order room service and bring your own champagne - you can request a fridge be brought to your room for $10 (much, much cheaper than the mini bar prices!).  The breakfast is great, make sure you're on the verge of starvation so you can try everything on offer.",5
"I'd always thought the Marina Bay Sands looked rather big and impersonal but I couldn't have been more wrong - the staff were wonderful, the room was great with lovely views and the most comfortable bed I have slept in for the long time.  The rooftop swimming pool is amazing and the position of the hotel is ideal for visiting the Gardens by the Bay, the Art Science museum, Singapore Flier etc.  An additional unexpected bonus was the discount in the restaurants in the shopping mall and at the museum.",5
"What attracted me to the Marina Bay Sands was the pool. Even though I was traveling on business by myself, I upgraded to a Club level view so to get the breakfast and evening reception. This was much more convenient than paying the higher prices for eating out elsewhere. As expected, service was outstanding and the room was a dream. The gym/spa in the hotel was fantastic as well. Will definitely return in the future.",5
"A behemoth of a hotel. A number of welcoming staff for an efficient check in. Excellent sized rooms even in the lowerst priced room. Plenty of amenities and mini bar. Stunning views from the room! Absolutely no chance of struggling to find somewhere to eat, or shop.  Skypark must be done! Slightly engulfed by wannabe celebs, but a stunning place for pictures.  Room service excellent.",5
"Awesome room facing the Gardens! The twinkling lights in the evening was lovely. Room was soundproof and quiet, although the room was near the lifts. Loved the huge bathroom and double sinks. Room was clean, huge and new. Will definitely be back! ",5
"This place is beautiful and huge. Even after you get off the subway you still walk a mile or so to get into the property. So if you go there during day time you can take the elevator up to the roof and access the bar. I live in Las Vegas and I thought drinks at XS Night Club were expensive well Marina Bay Sands just took it to another level. I ordered a Stella Artois beer and it cost me $22 US Dollars.  Then I took the beer and stood about 20 feet from the infinity pool and pretended I could one day be so lucky as to swim there. ""Sigh"" As the sun starts to set the roof top bar starts to pack up and well.....I'll leave it to your imagination.",4
"Stayed in Marina Bay Sands (MBS) with my wife for six nights.  It was my first time to Asia, let alone Singapore.  Overall, I loved the experience although I'm not a fan of crowded countries or humidity.  The highlights of MBS are its: size (three amazing towers); location (attached to a fabulous mall; across the road from Gardens by the Bay - a good place to run outside; the breakfast buffet; gym; and, the infinity pool.  The drawback to MBS?  Temperature control in the rooms.  I suspect it's not the hotel's fault (faced the same challenge at a 5-star hotel in Lagos, Nigeria) but it's really difficult to control the room's atmosphere.  It's either stuffy or too cold.  Bring light sweaters and long-sleeves for hanging out in the room, if you are like me and prefer a cool setting…",4
"It will be unfair to say anything bad about the hotel. The location, rooms, the shopping complex and the casino is just perfect. You can just stay at the hotel and not miss anything in Singapore.  'Gardens by the bay'which is a great tourist attraction is 5 minutes walk and 'the water show' in the evening is also in front of the hotel entrance.   Price is a little high at SGD 600 per night. You can only travel in taxis as public transport is far. The famous infinity terrace pool is always crowded, for which I took away a star.Although this is not at all a deal breaker for the stay.Infact, if you have the money, this is the place to stay in Singapore.  ",4
"I didn't stay at this hotel, but it is a must see if you are in Singapore. You can see it from just about anywhere in downtown, but you need to go inside and check out the casino, walk around the shops, and go to the top for the awesome view. It is also an easy way to get to the garden by the bay",5
"I went back to Singapore after leaving there for 10 years.  My 15 year old daughter was born in Singapore and I wanted her to remember a great stay. indeed it was great, and worth trying. Location is great  The swimming pool on the roof is amazing, better go there EARLY in the Morning. 6.30am  is the right time if you want to enjoy Singapore waking up. and if you want the pool not to be crowded.",5
"Temper your expectations for your stay at Marina Bay Sands. The architecture of the building and the garden/city views are great. Of course not to forget the famous infinity pool. However, the hotel itself is disappointlingly standard. Nothing special about the rooms and the service. You will also find that the lobby and the rooftop are always crowded by guest and tourists.",3
"From arriving at the front door you receive a truly 5-star welcome. Bags are collected and you are escorted through an already opened door for you to a check-in area. As my reservation was checked I was taken to a priority check-in counter hidden to the side and checked in by a wonderful agent. We booked a premium room with city view. The view was spectacular and the room was laid out beautifully. The colours and vibe of the room gave you a relaxed and homely feeling. The infinity pool is incredible, definitely a bucket list item!  Cons - The room was rather small considering the price paid, which somewhat took away from the novelty of it all. Entrance to the dance club at the infinity pool is not complimentary, which I found to be a pretty big kick in the backside, again…",4
"Must be lucky to be in the higher floors for a better view of either the city or the gardens view. Everything was pretty damn impeccable from the room interior, amenities, the pool, the food, the fitness centre... except for the service.   A hotel at this status and price must have impeccable service from checking in up until check-out. After checking in at the lobby, the staff did not even bother to offer help for our luggages. So we went to our room all by ourselves and we welcomed ourselves in our own room. And seems like almost all guests are given that service as we observed other tourists trying to figure out which tower is their room at, how to use the access key in the lift etc. Also, there's no exclusivity. The hotel lobby is not only for guests but for everyone. …",3
"Booked a Club Room and everything was superb.  Arrived at 10:30 - very early! - was sent to the Club Lounge on Level 55 because our room wasn't ready ( as expected ), had coffee and juice, got emailed 40 mins later to say we could go to our room.  Despite the dire warnings on their booking confirmation, never had to queue for more than 30 seconds anywhere.  All round superb service.  If I could give them 6 stars I would.  They made me feel special and important.  The infinity pool is out of this world and the room was brillant.  I could go on (oh, yeah, breakfast was just ok - 5 stars for that, not 6, lol!) but, really, everything about this place is truly amazing.    Just go..........",5
"We stayed MBS hotel 2 nights for the travel of the 30th wedding anniversary. We have received Early check-in, swan-making by the bath towel, rose petal bath, services such as cake. So we were able to enjoy the travel of Singapore.  We like to travel abroad, Singapore travel become the 28th countries. MBS hotel is the best hotel in which to travel so far. In the future, we are looking forward to stay in MBS hotel again.",5
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands was a long lasting dream and in April 2016 it finally became reality. Of course this not your romantic hotel that you are looking for. Thinking about this hotel as a honeymoon destination? Look further, this is not at all a romantic hotel! But this is one for the experience!   Check in is like in an amusement park, queueing up for a while and waiting your turn. Staff is friendly though and I was among the lucky ones that could check in 3h earlier than the usual check-in time 3pm, which I think is freaking late.   Entering the room I was overwhelmed by the size, the Club Room I was staying in was incredibly big and pictures I uploaded dont do justice to its size. I actually found out a couple days later that I hardly made any pictures of the room as I…",5
"Marina bay Sands – Insider secrets for runners, swimmers, and gym workouts  Great hotel in a great place.    Lot’s of reviews already so rather than just repeat to same stories, here’s some new insights, especially for those travelers who either want to save a couple of dollars, like to workout, or just looking for some great tips  First – use the concierge.  The concierge staff is second to none.  Use them, and use them often.  Don’t be hesitant.  They gave me a variety of excellent restaurant choices, and many of them were not at the same price level as most restaurants in the hotel.  Breakfast is a challenge – everything in the hotel except for Sweet Spot is at least $40 US.  No kidding.  Back to the concierge.    When I asked about food tours, they gave some excellent…",5
From the moment from checking in early and having our room upgraded the stay got off to a stress free start. inside the room the bathtub was huge- something I definitely look for in a hotel room! The infinity pool was an absolute highlight and didn't disappoint. We found the location ideal and in close proximity to everything we wants to see. The only thing to remember when booking is the ++ expect extra charges. Would definitely return.,5
"I am quite loyal to my Singapore hotel but I decided to give the Marina Bay Sands a try. I needed to experience the views from such an imposing, iconic building. We were two couples staying in Club rooms, one on either side of the building. One room had gorgeous city views from ceiling to floor windows but on the other side the views of Gardens by the Bay were equally stunning especially at night and we had a balcony. Its always nice to be able to slide open some doors and step out of an air conditioned room and get some fresh air. The club room is quite large with ample storage and a nice big bathroom. The check in was very slow even from the designated club desk. It is a very busy lobby as it is often filled with not only guests but tourists and locals. It felt like a bit of a…",3
This hotel is one of the most popular place to stay in Singapore. With malls downstairs and also casino and of course the infinity pools at the top of this building that provides you with eye pleasing view to Singapore. Bad note is for the smoker! ,4
"The hotel is huge and pretty complicated to navigate around...I.e. Check in/check out..rooms... The pool at the top is the highlight...but extremely crowded...nice to see, but no relaxation at all. The breakfast buffet is amazing in layout, quantity and variety, but again, very crowded..the rooms are pretty ok and nothing fancy or special.",3
"I've celebrated my anniversary at MBS and it was an unforgettable experience! The room was bay facing, and it has ceiling to floor windows with an absolutely fantastic view of the city skyline. Guests also has access to the infinity pool on the roof, complimentary breakfast and free wi-fi. The gym is located between the towers and it's top of the line. I've stayed in the basic suite, but I've seen other rooms and there are some with even a pool table. It's the best place to stay when visiting Singapore.",5
"Travelled to Singapore on the way back home from Boracay Island, Philippines. Five days of lolling around in the Sun 'N' Sand over, back to the City high life, and What a way to get back to the City?!!, Marina Bay Sands is just ""Awesome"". Huge Property, Iconic Design, triple towers, the world's largest rooftop Swimming pool and observation deck(the Sands Sky Park), floors you right at the turn. Its a huge experience to wade in the infinity pool on the rooftop, though a bit too crowded, understandably so. The view from the top is simply breathtaking, especially in the night. Sunset makes lovely photo ops. Food is what you would expect from this class of hotel, they have many choices for breakfast, Club 55, exclusively for club room and suite guests, Spago, by the pool, Adrift and…",5
"The hotel is a must visit but it may not be 5 stars. The iconic pool is also a must see but be prepared for a lot of other hotel guests. There are also three restaurants up on the pool level but unfortunately after 9pm one of them did not allow children - big disappointment!!  We were upgraded to a room with a city view - views were spectacular, and the location is fantastic!",5
"Stayed here for our last night in Singapore and am already thinking about a return trip! We were able to check in 3 hours early, our room was beautiful, clean and the view was incredible. Rooms have a small balcony which was handy for putting our wet bathers on the hot tiles to dry. The pool was perfect temperature (1 pool is adults only), waiters come and take your orders for yummy drinks & you can refresh your towel regularly. So nice!",5
"This has become an Icon amongst hotels in the world and was on my 'Must Do' list. We were greeted by the Bell Service upon our arrival.  So efficient and friendly, we proceeded on to checkin where once again we were impressed by the high level of service and efficiency.  We had arrived many hours before checkin time and were very thankful that our room was ready. On our way to the elevators, like magic, our bags were on there way up at the same time as us. This communication with the bell service must have been done electronically as no phone call was made from the front desk.  The porter knew which room we were going to and gave us many helpful hints on the way up to the 42nd floor.  Our room was lovely and overlooked the gardens and bay with a balcony to enjoy the fresh air. …",5
Beautiful hotel amazing pool and views. Room was fabulous. Staff really helpful and friendly great housekeeping service. Restrictions on where kids can eat times ect would have been good to know this on arrival. Definitely a great place to stay x,5
"This hotel is so iconic that it is worth going - the architecture and design are unique. The views from the roof are amazing, drinks in the rooftop bar and swimming in the infinity pool are a must.   Our room was quiet with beautiful views to the marina. And bed was comfy! We had tasty dinner in restaurant Spago - I can highly recommend that, food was delicious.  We had only quick 1 night stop here and early flight next morning so we even hadn't time to eat breakfast. So, I cannot give a complete review as the hotel is huge and we didn't have enough time to experience all.",5
"We spent 3 nights in an Orchid suite to finish our week-long family vacation in Singapore. Our 2-room suite was absolutely great, located on the 52nd floor of Tower 3 and offering hypnotizing views over the Gardens by the Bay and the Ocean covered with dozens of ships of all sizes. The room had an open air balcony with plenty of flowers and this was very pleasant, although we did not spend that much time outside, our daughters preferring the swimming pool... The bedroom had very high ceilings which gave it an additional luxury touch. The bathroom was giant and beautiful with a huge tub and a separate and also huge shower and large mirrors on the walls.

super hotel with a magnificent view of the city from skypark. has a nice infinity pool which is open only for hotel guests,4
"Nice iconic hotel, but a zoo inside. Rooms were nice. Views outstanding, even on backside overlooking Gardens by the Bay/ocean. The lobby and ground floor level is a zoo of guests and tourists (non guests) which is busy like a resort.  The sky deck pool area has wonderful views but there is no tranquility due to the excess of people and cameras, which detract from the experience. The food court at the Marina Shoppes is fantastic. The location is excellent as you are not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd, yet walking distance or an easy taxi ride to all attractions, shopping, and bars/restaurants.",5
"Seriously, this place isn't worth the hype or the expense! There are plenty of great hotels in Singapore for the same price (or cheaper) and you'll get a much better experience with them.  MBS is just too big, there are too many people and the facilities just can't cope. The roof top pool is cool for about 5 mins, but the crowds, the noise and the hundreds of kids make the pool area not a place you want to hang out for a long time.  I was just really surprised at how impersonal and over crowded everything was...",3
"So much of this hotel is unique. The architecture is obviously unique. The pool is a show-stopped in itself. The rooms were a touch small, but very nice. Views in either direction are just about worth it. The really nice aspect of this hotel is it offers tons of stuff to do that you just walk to. The resort and immediate area are an attraction in itself. But it is a little distant from other highlights in Singapore. Having a MRT stop on site does alleviate that somewhat. The downside, it is very expensive. The food options are very expensive (though quite good). I found the service in a couple of bars to be somewhat lacking, but at other times it was quite good.",5
"I just stopped for 2 nights and then again later in the week for another 2 nights, I could not fault this hotel, yes its busy because its very good, it does seem as a transit hotel and people seem to be just passing through which I was too, if your visiting Singapore for a short stop then its a must place to stay, great pool on the top, plenty of restaurants,",5
"My husband and I stayed here for one night for the sole reason of the infinity pool! Upon check in, we had an automatic upgrade! We had a garden view on the 46th floor. We spent majority of our time at the pool and wow just wow what a beautiful design and layout! We did not want to  leave! It was absolutely paradise. The water was perfect temperature, the poolside bloody mary was delicious and the views were priceless. Wish we stayed longer but wanted to keep exploring Singapore!",5
"We stayed here last April, and overall we enjoyed our stay here in Marina Bay Sands. The Infinity pool and Sands Sky Park was spectacular! It was really an amazing view of the whole Singapore.  Though, there are just a few points to improve:  Cons: - Check-in process took a long time - Too crowded - No bidet in the bathroom  All the staff were amazing, guest service agents and concierge were all accommodating.",4
Stayed here prior to going on a cruise. Room was enormous with views over Bay gardens. Very well equipped room. Couldn't fault check in or out. Pool is stunning although it was difficult to find any changing rooms. Had the buffet for dinner - excellent value and quality.,4
"It's all worth the money to stay in this amazing hotel. The facilities were awesome. I think this is the world's tallest infinity pool and the view was amazing. You really get what you pay for.  Very convenient with fabulous shops, restaurants, underground train and a lot more.  Once again! Thank you...",5
"Such a beautiful hotel, the sky deck is amazing, rooms very clean and beautiful. This is a true 5 star resort, with true 5 star pricing.  Food was very nice, but I do recommended going out and eating elsewhere because it an get too pricey if you arent rich, and you want to experience all the food singapore has to offer, there is more traditional food outside of this hotel.  Would stay again if I had the money.",5
"We stayed there for 4 nights, but that room that we chose was only available for 2 days. We had no choice but move the room. However, they upgrade out first room to Deluxe, so we didn't have to move anywhere. It was such nice of them.",5
"My wife, my daughter and myself were on trip with another family of four. Visiting Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore. It was a trip for my wife's 50th birthday and also to see our son in Australia. It was my wife's 50th birthday so I wanted to make it special. I emailed all hotels concerned, to see if they could help me make it extra special. The only hotel not to respond was the marina bay sands. When we arrived at the other hotels they had either upgraded our room or put a bottle of bubbly in our room on arrival. Marina bay sands was our last stop on our trip. Our daughter ( 22 ) was sharing a room with us at this hotel. We at least expected 2 queen beds, but actually got a king plus a camp bed. No room upgrade or bubbly, not that I expected anything. The other family we were…",3
"There are not enough stars to rate this place it is mind blowing, I only booked it because out flight was delayed and it was one of the less expensive choices on Agoda sorry trip advisor, we would never book such an outrageous place ordinarily but the rooms have 3 phones one in the loo a chaise lounge the curtains open when you enter the room our room 20th floor looked out over the bay gardens and super trees!!! It has its own shopping centre and an infinity pool and garden on the roof 57th floor. I could go on, the staff are incredible considering the vast number of visitors daily they convey bags faultlessly to the room and nothing is too much trouble, what a hotel",5
I stayed the Marinabaysands with my hasbands for two days.The Infinity pool is so nice. It  is devided adult corner and children. 夫と2日間滞在しました。プールは圧巻です。子供連れ様と大人だけ用とわかれていたので、大人用エリアでは本当に寛げました。ホットなジャグジーが2箇所あり、レストランも4軒あります。また屋外プールでは、世界一高い場所にあります。それだけに景色は素晴らしいです。 ホテルの建築家はモシェ・サフディです。部屋も綺麗で、広め、なかなか良いです。場所も便利。,4
"It's all worth the money to stay in this amazing hotel. The opulent facilities, the world's tallest infinity pool and the amazing view. You really get what you pay and can't help but impressed.   Very conveniently located with fabulous access to underground trains, shopping, restaurants, parks and much more.",5
"What an awesome experience!! Yes it cost some money and yes it is a really big gigantic hotel, but when you are in Singapore just book this hotel at least for one night! It is fantastic, the room, the service, the building, the experience but of course most of all the pool! What a view, fantastic!",5
"Loved staying here! Only wish we'd booked for longer. Two nights went too fast. The highlight was definitely the infinity pool at night, where you could eat dinner, drink a cold beer, take some late evening dips in the jacuzzis and enjoy the amazing views. Room was excellent too, and the whole experience a delight. We'll be back!",5
"I cannot say that the Marina Bay Sands is my favorite hotel in Singapore. It is not that anything is wrong with the functional room, the efficient service or spectacular the view as they are all excellent. While I feel somewhat privileged to be staying here, I also found it to be too busy for my own liking. This hotel is a landmark and a lot of people visit it for its rooftop facilities.   Garden view is great. You get a unique, bird’s eye view of the Gardens by the Bay and the sea beyond. My room was on Tower 3 and the two domes were seen right out my balcony. The city view you can see easily when you visit the pool or Club55. For regular guests, breakfast options were either at “Rise” on lobby level or “Spago” on the top level with pool view and all. You can try both if you…",5
"New experience.. Can not compare with any other hotel.. lobby, restaurants, room, skypark and the swimming pool everything is unique.. MRT very near.. Crowded hotel but this will not affect you because the staff is very professional.. Stayed here on April 21 for one night.",5
"Positives:   We had amazing suites which were really spacious. We had a butler who arrived quickly to any request.   View from the pool   Negatives:   Check in took 20 minutes - why can't hotels make this process speedy? It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes.   The pool was overcrowded almost to the point of us not wanting to spend anytime up there. Full of children and noisy - not in the slightest relaxing. If you want to relax I suggest you don't stay here.   Around the pool there are turnstiles which you have to activate with you room key. On the way in to the pool and again if you want the bathroom, and again if you go between towers, and again if you leave the pool. It almost felt like a theme park.   Don't get me wrong this is a fabulous hotel, but not what we expected…",3
"We booked two hotels white in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands and also the Fairmont Singapore so I can definitely compare these two luxury hotels and hopefully help someone who is trying to decide between these two (and other hotels in the area)  CHECK IN Our flight arrived very early, so we arrived at the Sands around 7AM, knowing well that check in is supposed to be around 3PM, so we were not expecting to get into the room so early.  Our first impression was how big and imposing the building is - a true architectural wonder.  We got to the check in desk and they instantly found our reservation.    They told us the room is not quite ready, but that we can leave our bags, and go to the gym/spa to take a shower and freshen up and then we can go to the rooftop pool to enjoy it. …",5
"we stayed at this hotel for a night after our wedding, we had a sea view room, and for some reason the curtain wasn't closing, a repair man came up and fixed but later that night, it jammed again...I spoke to the Manager Alex and told him I was not pleased, he immediately upgraded us to a top floor suite, the room was massive and really amazing, it turned out to be a really memorable stay for us..the hotel is quite special",5
"Went up to overlook SIN from highest place. Is cheaper than taken sinflyer, but take care! If you want to go for drink or dining, go directly 57. this is free of charge. For 56.floor looking around only, they charge SD 23.,!!! Not worth To go up Marina Bay Sands its a must, even if you dont sleep there. Yr are not allowed for a swim in roof pool,,when not guest in hotel! First floor is nice for coffee, snacks Not staying with this hotel!",5
"Upon entering the room, the curtain will open automatically  for you to see the great view outside. We had a city view room in front of Fullerton Hotel and Merlion Park. It was great! Aside for 1 thing.... The toilet has no bidet...",5
Stayed here last april 20 to 22. Very nice hotel but too crowded. But it has an amazing view!! Very near shopping area and bus stop. If you want not too cheap food there is rasa pura. The mrt and the bus stops is very near.,4
"Marina Bay, in fact the entire local area, is a must see during any trip, even an overnight.  Take the family, the girlfriend, or even just by yourself.",5
"Stayed here for 6 nights while running an event at the property. The rooms are lovely, views are great, amenities are all top notch, clean and housekeeping are excellent. No complaints at all about the rooms.   Room service is prompt and all the other food I ate while at the hotel was also of a good standard. The cocktails at the bar in the middle of the hotel on lobby level are also very nice!  The rooftop pool is certainly the draw card with amazing views however it gets very busy up there, almost not able to cope with the demand. You need to get up there early to claim your spot if you want a chair.  While this is an amazing, grand and beautiful hotel, excellent location and so many things around it to do, it is a very big production and you are left feeling like just another…",4
"A definite must do in Singapore.... BUT HERES THE SECRET .... Shhhh .... Rather than going to the Skypark viewing area (SGD$25/ adult ), get directions up to the bar (free entry) and have a beer ($20) and sit and admire the same view.... Brilliant views across Singapore on a clear day.... ",5
"You can stay at that hotel,  not go out! Trade gallery Shoppes connect with hotel with shops, restaurants, but most important is on the top. Infinity pool with view on the city from 57th floor, a lot of sun chairs. In my experience any time  you can find free  chair. At the afternoon not so many people around the pool, during the sunset and twilight more peoples come. Pool close at 11 pm. Interiors of the rooms could be better, but the view beat everything! The breakfast is very good, a lot of varieties. Japanese, Asian, Europian dishes. But the cost - 50 sin $. Anyway it is a place to be.",5
"I had a WONDERFUL stay at the MBS! Had a huge room overlooking the gardens that had enough space to fit 8 people comfortably! The mall was terrific, as usual, with the infinity pool being the highlight!  Go early in the morning if you want to enjoy the pool with less people as it gets VERY crowded in the afternoons and evenings.",5
the hotel was good and the breakfast were so many choices. the location was strategic and i love the bar here. very near to the shoppe at marina bay sands. many branded shops and good service hotel. will come back,5
"It can be difficult to find a spot on the rooftop infinity pool/ crowded, but with reason. The view is beautiful at all times of the day and night. Staff of the hotel is amazingly friendly and attentive. Would also recommend the rooftop club (used to be called Ku De Ta) next to the pool as it offers a beautiful view of the city lights reflecting off the bay :)",5
"This hotel is really amazing. But according to the reviews I read on Tripadvisor I was not stimulated to stay. They said there was a long line to check in. It was not true. Maybe it happens in high season. The swimming pool is awesome. They also said it was overcrowded. I did not see it .There are lots of chairs. It is wonderful to lay on a chair and contemplate the whole view. The room is very good. The size is perfect and very comfortable. The room view is also beautiful. One side is the bay and another the garden.  I loved the Marina Mall with lots of restaurants, stores, tearooms. The Garden by the Bay is breathtaking. You can not miss it. Everything was excellent during my stay.",5
Very nice place with big rooms. So many activities. Location is good as well. Best thing was the amazing view from the Sky. Very expensive place which is not value for money. Beautiful view from the high floor rooms day and night. Bed was so comfortable.,5
"Stayed for a night in deluxe room garden view which located at tower 3. Hotel is really busy but check in was a breeze, staff is very efficient. Room is on 40th floor, got a nice view of garden by the bay. Room is spacious with well equipped toiletries and basic amenities.   However, shower water pressure is really slow and I found that aircon vent is leaking with water dripping on the carpet. I believe things like this should not happened in hotel like Marina Bay Sands.   Went to check out the infamous infinity pool too. Room access card is required for entry into the pool. And is packed with people. There is almost no space in the pool.   Check out was a breeze too with efficient staff which can help with a tablet if the queue is too long. If u are driving, can purchase a…",4
"Marina Bay Sands is totally a landmark of Singapore, so when we decided to visit Singapore there was no doubt where to stay. We arrived quite early, but they kindly checked us in around 12:00, not 15:00. Before check-in time we enjoyed a walk in Gardens by the Bay. I was amazed how big this hotel actually is, and in the same time how well-organised is everything within it. Check-in, check-out, luggage delivery, taxi booking, breakfasts went so smooth, really amazing considering that there are thousands of people staying in this hotel at the same time.  Of course, the infinity pool was also gorgeous! It is really worth seeing at least once in your life. It is open from 6 am until late night, so you can see sunrise there. The pool is only for hotel visitors, so you need to have…",5
"I stayed there with my husband for a couple nights, it was an OK Hotel, with a spectacular view from the pool  The downside was the water in the pool was a bit irritating my skin yet I was in for few minutes (taking selfies for sure! Haha)  But I can still recomend this Hotel with a spectacular view in Singapore ",4
I enjoyed staying at this hotel though I read lots of reports saying that this is a busy hotel and I'll be standing in queues but staying in a club room solved this issue as I was in a high floor and using the lounge for bfast plus access to this incredible pool.  You should stay in this hotel at least once,4
"Amazing hotel and view, i have staid at the 45th floor, don't miss the amazing infinity pool, the hotel is connected to one of the best mall in Singapore, Also its near the since center and Singapore flyer.",5
The location is great and the hotel very nice.  However check in is 3pm and check out 11am others on our trip were 2pm and 12pm so this felt squeezed.  It wouldn't be so bad but you cannot use the infinity pool (the main draw of the hotel) after check out so you need to consider this if planning a single night stay.,4
"There is good and bad to this 2500+ room hotel.  The bad: It super crowded (serious long waiting lines with check-in and check-out), impersonal and not very customer friendly. The staff is uninterested, bored and unfriendly (almost rude). The pool is untidy and the water looks dirty. The fitness is small compared to the rest of the facilities. And everything (drinks, food) is very expensive.   The good: The rooms are great: nice and clean. The views are beautiful. The roof top pool is a must-do experience. It is conveniently located at the shopping mall, casino en public transport.  We considered our stay as a nice experience but we will not return to this hotel.",3
"A hotel room, with comfort bed, big toilet, great night view. To rate for quality of hotel, yes its a 5* hotel. In terms of price is a little bit too overrated. Yes location is centralised with many food places can be found not too far distance from the location of hotel. A big hotel with lots of staff working and catering to guest and public queries, a good customer service. A great place to stay for family or couples.  The swimming is big and wide. To enter you need the room key to enter. This might be a hassle for some. As its located near a restaurant, and if the guest go to swim with their keys on the chair with towels, anyone could just come and take to enter your room. In this case, guest privacy is being intruded. Furthermore there are many people at swimming pool area…",5
Stayed 2 nights here in a city view room. While it is pricy you get first class treatment from a great staff and the room was great no issues. The city view was spectacular at night and bed was fantastically comfortable. The food was good/great everywhere I went. I ordered room service one night and was very good! One tip...this is a great hotel to solo or couples but with children I would rather stay at Sentosa Resorts (see HardRock review) as it's cheaper and more to do for the little guys. I will stay here again for sure! ,5
"This place is out of this world! It is the full package whether on business, pleasure or family, you got it all in one place. I stayed here for two nights in the Bay Suite and oh my it was simply an unforgettable two nights. The service was five stars along with the restaurant options, mall access, sky bar up top and infinity pool and last but not least, a casino too? Im definitely come back soon! A must visit for everyone who passes by Singapore.",5
"I was very excited for a recent two night stay at this iconic hotel. Check in took 45min and then we waited for our bags to arrive at our room for another hour. Which normally would be a pain but we were traveling with our 5mo baby so it was a real inconvenience.The room was very small and our patio was almost the same size! Such a waste of space outside. We had a great view of the Gardens though. The bathroom only had a shower which was not separated from the bathroom by anything but a small glass window so every time you ran the water, the floor in the whole bathroom would be soaked. Very modern design that looked great, but not very functional.  Visited the infinity pool twice. The morning is best both for the view and I found later in the day the water got murky and gross as…",4
"Large and clean room, good views, good facilities, good service, but a little impersonal for my taste.  Great location with immediate access to the Casino, Metro, Gardens by the Bay, etc... Recommended for a few nights only, then I would move to a more boutique hotel.",4
"Marina Bay Sands was wonderfully impressive from the exterior, towering over us like a three legged giant creating a large shadow over the Singapore shopping area. It was equally impressive inside with the vast space leading to the top of the towers. We were in tower 3 with a lovely view of the Gardens by the Bay and the sea. The room was one of the nicest I'd stayed in as they were very large/spacious, ambiently decorated and there was a wonderfully designed sliding door/bathroom space.  The views were unbelievable and I actually got proposed too on one of their gorgeous balconies! The breakfast was a little chaotic to say the least but delicious. The choice of restaurants and location was really good. It's lively and fun. The pool was of course, wonderful but quite busy. I…",4
"Wow what a great place to stay. Service was excellent. View from room over Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore straits was brilliant. The room was very comfortable. The onsite restaurants offer many choices that should satisfy anyone. The icing on the cake was the infinity pool on the 57th floor that only hotel guests can use. WOW WOW, the view at nighttime over the city from the pool is mind blowing. Quite expensive but a definite must visit!!!!",5
"My wife, son and his partner stayed here as part of our tour of Bali, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand to celebrate my 60th birthday!! We stayed for just one night only but this hotel is everything you expect it to be and then some. It is not cheap but it is one of those "" we stayed there moments""! The views alone are exhilarating, but the sky park pool and restaurants on the roof are spectacular. The infinity pool and views are spectacular. The hotel has a host of top restaurants catering for all tastes. We ate in the Thai restaurant and the food was sublime. All the staff at this hotel are polite, helpful and considerate at all times. It is worth the money as you cannot buy the memories!",5
"Set in 3 ultra-modern high-rise buildings, this luxury hotel is a 2-minute walk from Bayfront metro station and 9 km from Universal Studios Singapore.   There are chic bars, and posh restaurants that serve international dishes",5
I just stayed for one night... but that was the best part of my trip to singapore.... awesome infinity pool.....with great service on the 57th foor poolside bar from the person to be mentioned 'Mr Mahesh Tamboli'..good service with good hotel made my day......,5
An incredible experience one that we will never forget. The pool was the best & an opportunity to swim at night over looking the nightly light show. There is a kids pool too. Dinner snack by the pool was great! Staff were always helpful & provided a cake for a recent birthday!!! Plus check-in was quick.,5
Check in was great and staff were nice. The room was and the hotel rewards membership was beneficial as you receive free wifi. Great location with access to shops and restaurants. Has one of the best hotel pools with views over the city.  The casino rewards program is separate and not worth it.,4
The design of this hotel makes it worth a stay as it is very stylish with beautiful rooms and amazing pool area. The breakfast was amazing also. However overall we found it quite impersonal compared to other hotels in Singapore and also very crowded by the pool. We enjoyed our one night stay but we are unlikely to come back.,4
"It's been an extremely pleasant and enjoyable experience staying at Marina Bay Sands. Everything from the very first minute you approach the hotel till the moment you leave simply exceeds your expectations.  Friendly hotel staff everywhere willing to make your visit unforgettable. We didn't have cash to pay for the taxi, so the hotel staff member offered to pay for us out of his pocket.  We got a free upgrade to a bigger room as we had a kid with us and the reception lady was willing to make the stay more comfortable for us.  Needless to say that the room itself, the view and all the facilities were up to the standard.   And the infinity pool... It's something you  have to visit when in Singapore. The  pics just don't tell well enough how amazing it is in reality, you have to…",5
"After deciding that we would have a stopover in Singapore there was only one hotel to choose, the marina bay sands is a fantastic hotel, we stayed on the 37th floor & the views were amazing, make sure you have the city view rooms as well, the infinity pool was amazing on the roof & had no trouble getting a sunbed, although we checked out in the morning the hotel kept hold of our luggage & let us have a shower in the spa that evening which was a nice touch",5
"This property is huge- three towers, casino, multiple celebrity chef restaurants, shopping mall and the long infiniti pool on the rooftop. The lobby area is impressive and massive. We booked a deluxe room with a city view. We can watch the light show from our room every evening. This hotel is a bit pricey but well worth the money. Sip cocktails on the rooftop. Take a dip in the pool and enjoy the magnificent views. I recommend going at night as well- pool is open till 11pm. The service was good- front desk, concierge, housekeeping, pool, etc. Room was clean and well maintained. Beddings, towels and amenities were all good too. An awesome experience!",5
"I booked to go to this hotel on a stop over to Vietnam as a little treat and it didn't disappoint!  From the moment you arrive at this hotel it is extremely impressive.   We stayed in a deluxe marina room on the 31st floor which has a stunning view of the marina. The room was fantastic and the bathroom had a huge walk in shower.   Obviously the reason you book this hotel is the pool and it doesn't disappoint. It is STUNNING!! Although it was busy all three days we where there and we struggled to get a sun bed,it didn't really matter as you spend most of your time in the water.   From the concierge to the maids all the staff are very kind and pleasant.   Only one criticism, it is very expensive. The restaurants on the top levels are way too costly. ",5
"I had been looking forward to my one night stay at the Marina Bay Sands and it was even more than I expected. Very easy check in. My room was just so well detailed and comfortable. The dining options were unbelievable Batali, Ramsey, Puck, Bouloud. The pool on the roof was insane.So Cool and fun. The view was unreal. Well worth the money and the time spent. I did not leave the hotel it was perfect",5
On 57th floor couple of good restaurants located which serve mouth watering dishes. The panaromic view from the top is  Breathtaking. The hotel guests have the luxury of swimming pool. Many local and foreign celebrities frequent these restaurants for the fabulous food they serve and the beautiful arial view.,4
"if you are in Singapore u def need to stay there one night , experience the city from above! the pool is amazing, the rooms very nice. the food is also very good! plus u will take the best pictures of your life there!!",5
I and my partner stayed for a stop over. It was a great experience in Singapore. The hotel has an amazing view. They have beautiful food at their restaurant at the lobby. The service was good. If you are fun with shopping.. its all convinient at the hotel itself. We enjoyed their infinity pool with a breathtaking City View.. Highly recommended,5
"My wife and I stayed 3 nights in a Grand Club Room. Checking in was quick, room was spotless and well appointed we loved our stay that much we have already booked again for September with our kids this time. Only thing we noticed was lack of shade by the pool , great shopping mall and easy access to theatre to watch a show. One other point that I did find annoying is the bar fridge in room , if you remove anything to put your water bottle in to chill it is automatically charged to your room 30 seconds after removed. But otherwise we have fond memories of breakfasts on level 55 and lunch by the pool.",5
"We reserved suite room with a living room. All staff are very nice and provided free rollaway to us due to along with kid. We booked room package inclusive free breakfast, afternoon tea and drink. I feel that there is worth to stay at there and must address infinity swimming pool, really enjoy and good memories of our vocation. ",4
"We stayed only one night at the end of our trip to see what all the fuss was about. It cost an extra S$180 (per night) compared to the Holiday Inn where we stayed for the other six nights.  Lobby reminded me of an airport departure lounge, full of people and queues everywhere. The room was very large and luxurious, lovely bathroom, but we couldn't use the fridge (which was stocked) without leaving a deposit, (only wanted to keep our water cool). Access to the Gardens by the Bay was via a high walkway through the hotel but you had to go outside and come in again via a different escalator. Must be to keep the general public separate to the hotel guests but it all seemed very inconvenient and long winded, especially in the intense heat and humidity.  Good point was we were able to…",4
The hotel is an iconic hotel with an excellent view of the bay. Food too is nice but we had a nasty experience with a security guard posted at their rooftop restaurant  Spago. This really spoiled the otherwise good experience of our stay.,3
"Very impressive hotel - not just aesthetically or in terms of its size and scale, but in the fact that it works so well. Difficult to believe that there are more than 2500 rooms, as we barely waited for the lifts, breakfast was relaxed and check-in was quick and easy in spite of arriving at a busy time. Our room on the 41st floor had amazing city views and a sofa bed, which was perfect for our teenage son. The pool certainly has the wow factor and we were also impressed by the other attractions and facilities nearby and by how easy it was to get to other parts of Singapore from there. While we loved the room and facilities, our son commented that the staff seemed a little cold and weren't too bothered about getting to know us as guests. Having said that, it didn't bother us as…",5
"One of the best experiences to stay in this hotel is the infinity pool, which is the only largest pool in the world where we see skyline. The cleanliness and the friendliness of the staff is outstanding. The rooms in garden side & city side are both great. I have been to this place thrice already and would love to visit when Im in Singapore again.",5
"Disappointed with my stay of 2 nights. The very day i checked in, the toilet was clogged n i told a housekeeping who was outside my room to have it fix. after returning at the evening , still not fixed. Seriously, I feel it's over rated.",3
"My husband and I booked a stay at the Marina Bay Sands as part of our honeymoon celebrations. We could think of no better place during our planning than to book at this hotel but were left bitterly disappointed in almost every aspect- quality, service, & cleanliness. Firstly the view is pretty good but that's pretty much what you're paying for. The room itself is nice, however there is nothing special about the room given the price you are paying, and in fact we have stayed in lower priced hotels elsewhere and had nicer amenities. So don't expect anything special. The worst thing about the rooms though is the noise! I could hear noise from every direction around our room. I could hear one lot of neighbours turning their lights on and off, I could hear every door in the hallway…",3
One of the best views in the world from our room on the  32nd floor.  The rooftop pool is the greatest  All the staff and I mean all the staff are very good at what they  do  This Hotel is a must see. And the room was 5 star also the  food,5
"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. The room is very nice and the city view from the window was amazing. The best thing at this hotel is the infinity pool on the 57th floor , you can enjoy the amazing view of the city while sitting at the pool.",5
"View from the swimming pool... must visit even if you are not staying here. We stayed for 4nights on the way to Japan for the first time. Every thing was great except the service of staff. It really showed its shallow history while Raffles, Goodwood Park and Mandarin have excellent service for their guests.",4
I can't believe that I can enter to this great building in Singapore. And have the biggest snack in my life. We're just planning to have a short snack at Kundiman is the name of restaurant (i just guess) :). We arrived there at 12 and until 3 pm we're still there waiting for our foods served one by one. We regret when we finished when we saw another restaurant like a bar resto near the long pool. It makes me want to jump off the pool but afraid because its at the side of the building. Im afraid i might fall off the building hhaha. But its such a nice experience. Thanks to my friend,5
"Very nice and posh hotel. Room was very comfortable. Extensive buffet spread, with variety to suit travelers from different background. The best feature is the rooftop infinity pool. One can spend half day just sitting and soaking in the view of Singapore. The staff members are very courteous, polite and understanding. The receptionist saw that we had 2 very tired and sleepy kids and he was very kind to give us our room at 7 am, way before the checkin time of 2pm. Overall, it was a very good experience. We would to stay there again. ",5
"This place is unreal. The view from the pool is unlike anything else I've experienced. Worth every penny for the memory! Watch out for high table minimums throughout the casino, however. That was the only downside.",5
"Absolutely loved our one night stay in this hotel,  I didn't want to leave! The room was quite large, very clean and had magnificent  city views from the 48th floor. The infinity swimming pool is amazing and so are the viewing platforms on the top floor. The only fault would be the slow checkin which took an hour.  This hotel really is a Must Do in Singapore!",5
"My husband and I plus our 2 children aged 2 and 4 stayed in an orchard suite in tower 3 in the 54th floor.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel I was blown away! The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the checkin process was fast and easy. When we walked into the room I couldn't believe how huge it was! Bigger than any hotel suite I have stayed in. There is a separate living area with a sofa bed, which was perfect for the kids, and then a massive master suite with so much space. The bathrooms were also very beautiful. Our first Morning there we went to the infinity pool which has to be seen to appreciate how unique is. The only negative thing I can say is there was large groups of adults in the pool just taking photos and yelling and screaming constantly. For this…",5
We had a one night/day layover in Singapore be fore boarding the Queen Victoria for Cape Town. We were upgraded to floor 47 overlooking the botanical gardens the view of the gardens and the sea beyond was amazing. The roof top bar and pool were excellent but best early as they were less busy. The bar on the ground floor was a very nice place for the final night cap. The Chinese restaurant is expensive but worth the price if you like great food. You can walk to the botanical gardens which are really very unique and beautiful.,5
"We were here for our 10th anniversary.  The hotel no doubt is just up to the mark but the staff near the infinity pool are not friendly or cooperative. Even on the lobby area, they are just not bothered about the customers. In fact they don't even smile while serving. Anyways the infinity pool is just mind blowing , spent the whole day there. ",3
"I went to Singapore and I had to stay here. The hotel outside is a work of art. You can see it from everywhere. I actually y got a good rate for the 38th floor tower 3 city view.  I thought the lobby was going to be something else.. but it was a normal ... but huge lobby. Nothing special.  My room was big.. really big.. and the view was just spectacular. That only was worth the money. Now.. the reason I came here... THE POOL.  WOW.. what an incredible experience.  I just have to say the men and woman that work by the pool deserve a trophy. They work very hard under the sun the whole day and they give you an excellent service. The remembered my name every time. Expensive drinks.. but.. hey.. it's Singapore.  Whatever you need, they will make it happen.  There is a bartender from…",5
My husband and I stayed here on arriving in Singapore early April. Check in queues on arrival with 10 min wait but we were taken to a separate area to check in. So it's effectively managed. Large spacious rooms with great view and lovely big bathrooms. We headed straight to the pool. The pool makes this hotel - the views are amazing and I felt like I was on holiday and relaxed immediately! Service by the pool is attentive bringing drinks and food orders to your beds. It is busy - however no one really helps you to find a bed which would be a nice touch - but you can find one eventually. There is an adults only area which is welcomed. . Pictures are taken that you can purchase which was a nice addition ( although over priced - but to be expected) wasn't overly pleased at the…,4
"The Marina bay sands is part of the Sands corporation, much like their other properties the Venetian etc. So you expect to find that this hotel is crowded and busy, and so it is. and you expect to find the usual casino (lines to get in are extremely long) huge shopping center with the lovely gondola rides. There are plenty of places to eat if you do not want to eat at the hotel restaurants.   These hotels are must go places however the Infinity pool makes the Marina bay sands one to tick off the bucket list. The pool, it is simply amazing. especially on a clear day. On a busy day the pools are packed and it can be hard to find a seat, i found it very entertaining sitting back in the pool watching people fight over seats. The drinks by the pool service is nice however at night i…",4
"Was very much looking forward to staying here, and the pool on the top floor makes it worthwhile.  Amazing views from the top, just can't beat that!  Gym is also on the top floor and is huge, complete with amazing views too.  Probably the best hotel gym I've been in.  My room was just ok, probably not helped because it didn't really have a view being on a lower floor.  Lobby is too crowded and very touristy, not really a nice place to be.  Overall worth a stay for the pool and gym alone.",4
"The view from the pool deck is amazing, food is excellent. Service exceeded our expectations, the location is excellent with plenty of shops to look at. The walk around the bay is very relaxing and well worth doing. Would highly recommend staying at the Sands.",5
"We always look forward for our staycation at Marina Bay Sands. When we arrived at the lobby, Mr Din approached us and escorted us to the Front Desk. He was very friendly and such a cheerful guy. Positive energy! We chit chat a little bit while waiting for our turn.  We were serve by Mr Tijen who is very professional answering all our queries. His tone of voice is very smooth and very polite. He is very patient serving us and he did not brush us off because we asked a lot of question. He gave us early check in. Thank you Tijen. He even make sure that we are okay before going up to the room.  The room was very clean as always. Love the view. Worth the price that I paid for. I visited the pool and I love it. It's the highlight of the property. We caught a glimpse of Team Captain…",5
"What a simply wonderful hotel.  From the efficacy of our check in, the warm ambiance of the reception to our wonderful Club Bedroom together with the Club facilities and the truly amazing infinity roof top swimming pool this has got to be the best hotel my husband and I have ever stayed in and we have stayed in a lot of hotels!  Spent 3 nights here before boarding our cruise ship and will just say there is no where better to stay in Singapore.  It is certainly worth upgrading to a Club Room in order to be able to use the Club Lounge for 2 hours of free drinks and canapés every evening.  Thank you Marina Bay we look forward to returning to your wonderful hotel in the future.",5
"If you aren't a hotel guest in and around this facility, prepare to be looked down on. Carrying military ID and drivers license(left passport in room safe), was unable to use gaming floor; apparently you have to have passport. Sky park- super expensive and you don't find out until last minute that the 28 USD you pay doesn't even allow you to use any of the major facilities or come close to a tree or PARK. You might as well call it sky DECK if you're going to be selling it as such. I'm sure this place is great for hotel guests, but was treated like 2nd class citizen at casino and Skypark.",2
"It's definitely worth visiting this hotel esp if you have right budget to spend. This place is catered for convention and also entertainment. Cool, sleek place.  Room that I have is quite spacious based on Singapore standard size. Although there is no bathtub, the rest of amenities are there. Usb charging ports are welcomed too.  Its the place to be if you are visiting Singapore for 1st time and have a bit of money to spend. Do join the membership! That's my tips to u.",4
"There is nothing much i could comment on how wow the hotel is expect for the lovely infinity pool and the view of gardens by the bay. The rooms are quite small & compact when compared to other 5* hotels. I felt like marina bay sands was more of a busy, commercialized hotel. The staff looked very tired and I had to wait in long ques to check out. There is nothing special about the staff, they are trained to do what they are to do that is providing the service you would not see any one going out of the way to help you out.  The only one thing i can comment is the waiter Mr Raj Kumaran Marimutum (I hope i got his name right). He was the most friendly waiter at the SPAGO restaurant. Smiling all the way and checking with guest if all are good. He even showed me the view of gardens by…",3
"Really hugely disappointed in this property. Pleasant enough but entirely unremarkable room. Bland foyer. The properties major feature of course is the pool. Yes the view is amazing but the deck area is disorganised with chairs strewn around, used towels everywhere and half eaten abandoned food. Appalling. I'd actually say it was dirty and disorganised and the least Singapore like hotel experience you could get. Can't think of a reason to stay there when there are so many better alternatives. Not even a bathtub in the room. Every part of the property feels cheap except the bill. Avoid",1
"My parents and I just enjoyed every moment in the hotel. The room, the staff, the facilities and the location are all very good. There is nothing to complain (of course...except the price haha) when we stayed in Marina Bay Sands.  Recommend to spend a whole day in the hotel as there are many things to do. Have Toast Box for breakfast, can do shopping or casino or go Marina Bay Park in the Afternoon. Go inifinity pool and Skypark before the sunset.   Excellent experience and would stay in this hotel again when I visit Singapore!   P.S. they gave me an elephant made by towels as a welcome gift. how cute it is! ",5
"Spent a night on our long asia\ oceania journey last fall. This hotel was originally to expensive for us, but we was very glad we paid for it. We spent most of the time on the ""roof"" lyaing beside the awesome infinity pool with insane panoramic view.  This is a must do.",5
"You need about a week just to explore the hotel it's so huge! Breakfast in the morning is great the hotel rooms are incredibly spacious highly recommend only downside is waiting for a taxi may take an hour! 2200 rooms people have got to go somewhere, check in didn't experience any problems was great!",4
"We are celebrating my parents 30th Anniversary , as I wanted it to be very memorable I booked a 3nights stay at Marina Bay Sands. Check In was fast and very efficient as Ms. Elaine who is at the front desk assisted us and even move us from 19th floor to 38th floor as I say I would want a high floor room. Room was so big for my parents and I. Bell guy assisted us and show us how the facilities work at the room work. We rest for awhile and headed to the infinity pool as its a bit crowded but we managed to get a place to chill. Servers there were very polite.   I would like to commend also the housekeeper who always keep our room clean and tidy and always greet us with a smiling face, Wen Jing is her name if Im not wrong.   Overall every single cent that I spend was all worth it.…",5
"What a banging hotel! Worth every penny spent. Its big and top notch luxury. The rooms are brilliant and spaced out with beautiful views all over. The higher you go,obviously the better. Cannot complaint about anything on the rooms bit. The hotel is facilitated with their swanky rooftop swimming pool which is their signature and the bibe there is just phenomenal although the amount of crowd will make it feel like a community pool. But 63 floors up, you wouldn't mind. The hotel houses a lot of restaurants and cafes, a lot of which are from celebrity chefs. The restaurants are in the mall attached to the hotel in which a lot of shops,you get a good amount of deals if you are a resident of MBS. But always make a reservation at the restaurants. If you are lucky you can watch a show…",5
"Excellent Place to stay if any one visit Singapore. Awesome view of Infinity Pool on roof top, must enjoy the view of Singapore and laser show from the pool, Large and beautiful rooms. Casino and shopping area are too good besides Lavish buffet Breakfast.",5
"The view from the rooftop infinity pool is breathtaking.  I can't remember a moment where a hotel pool has been so dramatic.  A stay in this hotel, even just for one night, is definitely recommended when you visit Singapore.",5
"We had two nights here on our way back to the UK after visiting Cambodia and Vietnam. My husband is a big F1 fan and had seen this hotel on the TV coverage (I'd never heard of it and until I started to research the trip didn't realise it was on a lot of people's 'bucket lists') The hotel lobby is very impressive and the staff are very professional. We never had the problems at check in like others have mentioned. Our check in was smooth and the receptionist was really polite and asked us where we'd travelled etc. The hotel was explained in detail re having to carry 2 room cards and the restaurant locations. We had a room in Tower 1 on the 26th floor and it certainly had the 'wow' factor! The curtains open automatically when you enter the room to reveal the most amazing view,…",5
"Absolutely loved this hotel. For 5 stars you would expect the service, staff and food to be above and beyond your expectations and for me it was. The staff were kind and helpful with sorting out an extra bed and the food was amazing. The best part was the sky park at the top with the infinity pool which is unlike anything else in the world. Overall, I loved this hotel.",5
"From arriving at the hotel to leaving nothing was too much trouble for them even when we needed there help in an emergency.  The pool was everything it promised and more providing some great photo opportunities.  Location is excellent and you don't need to venture far to have everything you need with direct access to the mall.  Ask for a garden view room, the view is amazing and make sure you visit the gardens by the bay at night for the show.  The only downfall was having to pay for wifi after the first 24 hours, I thought this was a service which could be included. ",5
"This hotel was a bucket list thing for me. I wanted to swim in the infinity pool.  We had a nice room overlooking gardens by the bay, it was great to watch the nightly light show but there was no balcony furniture! Massive balcony with not even one chair. Doesn't make sense to me.  Two massive beds were comfy, bathroom was lovely.   We had room service, presentation was great, food wasn't. We had beef burgers which were undercooked despite asking for well done. Overpriced.  I came home with severe food poisoning, it was either from MBS or the superhero cafe. ",3
"Awesome architecture, transportation, natural and food. The best place, perfect combination between nature and architecture. All the Singapore landmarks are here!!!!. Such as Marina Bay Sand, convention center, helix bridge, etc. You will meet a great experience, light, colourful & sound. The way to come here very easy just take the MRT to Bay front. Finally you will get an awesome time like me.",5
"Gorgeous overnight stay with a friend. Views of the marina bay are breathtaking and the rooms are beautiful , full length Windows give amazing views. Overall the hotel is huge and definitely not boutique or personalised service but it's luxury at a huge scale. Pool is definitely worth visiting once in your lifetime ",4
"Worst service i ever experienced, spent time near the bars at the infinity pool and the service was awful. Forgetting order's and refusing entry to bars on appearance eg look like you haven't got lots of money, do not stay in this hotel! Don't mind paying 28 dollars a cocktail for good service!",1
"At €23 a head I thought this was a bit expensive just for the chance to take some pics from the Skydeck. However if you say you are going to the bar -Ce La Vi - you ride up for free in an elevator just inside the doors of Tower 3. Once up there be warned that prices are high - light lunch, soft drinks and a coffee cost €81 for two of us. The food and service were good though! Be sure to walk around as there are more areas available to you than just the restaurant: however without paying the ticket price you can't go everywhere and of course the pool is just for residents. Still glad we opted for lunch though!",3
"What a great place to stay - if you like very large and impersonal. Yes it has everything from high end shopping, large rooms with a view, attentive staff and a spectacular endless pool. But, breakfast is mass produced and pretty tasteless - there was nothing like lovely Parma ham or yummy cheese,  bread offerings were average at best, bacon was like eating cardboard, fruit choices limited ....... Hmmm have had much better. And then the price of a drink at the pool - stick to water as a cold beer was nearly $25 !!!! Lovely experience for 2 nights but there is better choice in Singapore for what you are paying.",4
"What to say about this hotel? Breathtaking! Entering is a huge lobby where you can check in with a great piece of art. The price is a bit too high but what you pay is what you get. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The most amazing thing about this hotel is the swimming pool. A huge swimming pool on the roof, giving you the opportunity to see Singapore. I would totally recommend it if you have some spare money. If not, there are many other nice hotels much cheaper.",5
"We were very disappointed by the Marina Bay Sands. Knowing the high price of the hotel, I didn't expect so many rude and disgusting customers (especially at the pool).  The rooms are nice, nothing special. You have to take a lot of elevators to go everywhere because the hotel is so big. You have to queue for breakfast (20-30min). The pool was very cold. Service was quick to answer.",2
"the hotel is huge, there are even more than one spot to have a breakfast,i wouldnt say its amazing hotel the hotel is good but too overcrowded and very big. I do not like those kind of hotels the only thing why we stayed there a few nights its because of the pool at the rooftop which is brilliant experience and unfortunately you can visit the bar at the pool but not the pool if you are not staying at the hotel.",4
"A hotel this big and busy could be very impersonal, but everybody made an effort to make you feel special, even to the point of remembering your names. Very impressed. ok, so it helped having a club suite and lounge access, but this was a great stay. Attentive and smiling staff and clean facilities. really enjoying it. Oh, and get up to the 55th floor and get a cocktail from the lads... fantastic..",5
"Stayed at MBS and was not disappointed,  hotel is awesome,  slick booking in process, awesome foyer stayed in Tower 3 room on the 31st floor looking out over the gardens. Absolutely fantastic views from room, room did not disappoint. Very well proportioned rims and excellant decor, loved the eletric curtains! The main reason for staying here was the infinity pool, this did not disappoint,  it blow me away, utterly fantastic the views are stunning and worth the stay just that, the best hotel I have stayed in , and I have stayed in some excellent hotels. If you visit Singapore you must stay here!",5
"This time I stayed in a room on the 37th floor overlooking Gardens by the Bay. What a fantastic view, especially at night. Rooms are very large for Singapore and the housekeepers have great attention to detail. My only small wish is that they would leave a little space in the mini bar to put some fresh milk but that's a minor issue in an otherwise wonderful resort with everything from simple Dim Sum restaurants to celebrity chef restaurants.",5
Stayed at MBS for a group training and it was a great experience marred only by the longggkggg queue at check out. Special mention to the rooftop pool . Its an amazing experience to lounge in the pool,4
"Mega hotels are not really our style and we had chosen not to stay here previously, partly due to some mixed reviews, but we did enjoy the Marina Bay Sands. Of course its all about the rooftop... the epic infinity pool, the bars and spectacular views day and night. Its worth doing just for that.  We had a garden view superior room on the 44th and really couldn't fault it. Garden view is nice overlooking the sci-fi illuminated Marina Bay Gardens. Had some confusion about billing because we had to extend our stay but they got it right in the end.",4
"I booked a one night stay through Agoda and requested a room on the highest floor possible with the best view of the Marina Bay. I was so happy that his request was met and the view I had from my room was nothing short of amazing. It exceeded my expectations and waking up to it is something I will never forget. This is a fantastic hotel and while of course, not being cheap, you get what you pay for. The views from the infinity pool and the other areas on the top floor are also great, and really make for some fantastic photos! It has to be sampled at least once in your lifetime and I'm very glad I treated myself. Luxury at its best!",5
"We stayed at this hotel just before Christmas which was a great time to visit. Our room was on the 25th floor and overlooked the Tree Gardens. Loved the room! Marble bathroom, very spacious bedroom, electric curtains. Nothing was too much trouble for all the staff we encountered and they all just wanted to make this holiday special for us.  The roof top infinity pool is huge and the views from the pool are amazing but it was very crowded, perhaps because it was Christmas time. I would definitely return but perhaps not at high season.",5
"We stayed here for a night before we took off again from Singapore. My best friend's dad is a VIP here and we stayed for free. We got a large room, I think it was a premiere room with two large beds. The room was definitely nice and with water view.   We arrived pretty late at night and there was not much options for food. We ended up eating the congee and a couple of dishes in one of the restaurants, which was quite pricey but good service. There were not many options late at night like in other part of Singapore. We usually stay in Royal Plaza on Scott and I really prefer that hotel due to its location, cheaper and better for shopping really.   Definitely stay here if you have not done it. The roof top pool is nice but it was pretty crowded when we were there. It was still…",4
"The infinity pool, though crowded on the weekends, offers an amazing view of the Singapore harbour and refreshing snacks/drinks! The hotel is connected to a huge shopping mall with tons of restaurants to choose from. However, the lobby is always bustling with people and it can be quite distressing to make your way through the crowd. Service was great. Room service offers, to my delight, decent Singaporean/Malaysian/Indonesian food.",4
Please experience once in you life.the view from the room is excellent  And I have experienced bad about this hotel also about the payment up on check out I did pay in cash for my breakfast and I ask them to charge the room charges on my card but they did my breakfast charges also on my card this is not correct the service is very very poor,5
" Expensive hotel but worth it. The room really spacious .with dining table , couch to sit with wine and relax , i can say it was fully equiped nothing else to ask for. It was so clean from room to bathroom Scenery  from the room and going on top swimming pool ... it was really cool . All branded expensive shops..., restaurants, bars ..  i would love to stay again.",5
Nice crew and nice room.  Stayed in grand club room with parents and kids for two nights.  the food in the club is quite amazing....the ladies in the club  always  made my parents and children very very happy.  miss the sunset while we had our cocktail there.  Beautiful.,5
"The photos of this hotel are a spitting image of what you see! The view is absolutely incredible, the location is great also having Bayfront MRT located under the hotel and the professionalism of staff is a 10/10. I understand this hotel is a very big attraction but honestly just bite the bullet and stay in the amazing rooms! You will not regret this!",5
"As we were transiting through Singapore on our way to Beijing, my wife booked a couple of nights here...it happened to be my birthday at the time as well.   The booking was made via the hotel website, at the best rates available we could find. The process was quick and easy, as was making a couple of changes later on.   We arrived to see a long queue at the Tower One reception, but were pleasantly surprised to be taken aside and to the VIP reception, where we were checked in quickly and efficiently.    Our room, on the 25th floor, was spacious, well laid out and had all the amenities expected of a hotel in this price bracket. The view over the bay and city is great, particularly at dusk and into the evening as the city lights up. Beds were comfortable (we had our 9 year old…",4
Marina Bay Sands has a great reputation and great views however it is too big and full of tourists.  To move around the hotel you need your room key . The rooms are large and well appointed. The service is ok but nothing exceptional.,3
From the very moment you step into this Hotel you are surrounded by luxury. The pool on the 57th floor is iconic and a perfect place to relax (& take those memorable pictures of the Singapore skyline by day or night). The Rooms are large and luxurious and the staff friendly and helpful. There are restaurants aplenty and the Hotel adjoins the Shoppe center featuring ALL the top brands and MRT. A must stay if you find yourself in Singapore.,5
Guests enjoy sublime luxury at the Marina Bay Hotel and surrounds in Singapore. The building is iconic and the experience on the pool on the 57 floor is breathtaking. The room was large and luxurious. Your every need is catered for. The hotel is easily accessible and adjoins the Shoppe Centre.,5
"I was back visiting friends and family in Singapore and decided to splurge a little on a night's stay at the MBS. I've stayed in many hotels, and despite the high prices, it still isnt a lot compared to other hotels such as the fullerton bay hotel.   Check in was at 3pm and we arrived at around 2.30pm. There are 3 towers, but our check in receipt did not indicate the specific tower to go to, so we just joined the nearest queue at one of the towers.  MBS is a very big hotel so they have floor managers managing the queue and we were told, about 5 minutes in that we were at the wrong tower.   The tower we had to queue at was further down and by then, had a long queue snaking along the huge lobby. Now the MBS is a huge hotel with over 1000 guests rooms, so i understand that checking…",4
"I travelled with my family to MBS and stayed in the Orchid Suite for a week.  The hotel is amazing.  The pool, whilst sometimes crowded, provided excellent views and the service for drinks and food was fast and friendly.  The transfer provided by MBS was ridiculously expensive but efficient.  Your better off catching the train as there is a train station inside MBS.  A taxi will only set you back about $20 tops whereas the transfer is around $150.  That being said the driver was knowledgeable, friendly and very chatty which was nice for us and the kids - you wont get that on the train :D  The room was huge.  It had a lounge area with a dining setting for meals, separate guest bathroom and the actual bedroom was as big as the rest of the suite combined.  The bed was huge and…",5
"We arrived at Marina Bay Sands from Hong Kong for a 4 night stay. The transfer from the airport was about 15 minutes. The hotel itself is spectacular and forms an iconic view against the Singapore skyline. Based in the financial district opposite Garden By The Bay there are no bad views from the hotel. We had a room on the 43rd floor and the views were amazing captured day and night by the floor to ceiling windows. The rooms are large and spacious with everything that you would expect, we had no reason to upgrade. The first day we spent on the 57th floor which was accessed by a room key per person (only if a child is present are you allowed to enter on the same room key, otherwise one key per adult required). The views again night and day from the bar, Spago and the infinity…",5
"I've stayed at MBS a few times and never really had any problems but when I checked in last week for my premier room, I had requested a high floor or balcony room.   Unfortunately what I got for was a 1 inch balcony that you couldn't stand on and a floor with no view due to the pillars.  Really not what I was expecting for a 3000SGD room! Not cool at all.  A premium room was not worth the money at all, disappointing!!!",4
"Love Love Love the hotel!!! As soon as we arrived the concierge helped us out the taxi and held our luggage until our room was ready. The staff at MBS was very helpful and friendly room service was very quick and prompted which i love. The guy who delivered our luggage (i think his name was Mr Cheng) to our room was just on point he explained everything that we needed to know about our room, the area and charges that we needed to know about. Excellent service i must say. The infinity pool was just amazeballs literally took my breath away. i definitely would of stayed longer!!!!   we stay on the 49th floor which was spectacular the view was just beautiful looking out to gardens by the bay. The hotel has everything it has a massive mall with a great food court in the basement and…",5
"We stayed a few nights at Marina Bay Sands when returning to Australia from Europe in October 2015. We weren't disappointed! We wanted somewhere to relax and unwind before heading home after a hectic European holiday and Marina Bay Sands more than fulfilled that brief. Beautifully appointed suites, friendly, helpful and attentive staff and more than enough restaurants to choose from that you didn't need to leave the complex. The infinity pool just topped it off! On the radar now is a trip solely to Singapore and Marina Bay Sands will be the hotel of choice! Fantastic place to stay.",5
"Really nice Hotel. Excellent service. Very nice personal. Friendly atmosphere. Excellent location. Just a little bit crowded swimming pool, but it is obvious why it is so crowded. Good food. Nice place to stay for 2 days. Rooms are big (we had extra bed in our room and even after this we had a lots of free space), clean and nice. We stayed on 49 floor with city view and it was excellent.",5
"From lobby to room, the experience was breathtaking. The most wonderful feature of this hotel is definitely the Infinity Pool at the SkyPark. What could you say for a pool that located at the top of the 57th floor with a view overlooking Singapore Financial Center's skyline?",5
"Agree with other reviews about this iconic building with awsome views and pleasures to indulge in. However, all this is possible thanks to an army of some 10,000 working long hours and never tire doing their mundane work. It is therefore with appreciation to the management who plan and operate the logistics, but mainly to the staff who care for each and every one filing their 2500 rooms. Special mention to Paul in Spargo restaurant and Mr Qiu of houskeeping on 45th floor.",5
Excellent ambiance. Garden facing room was scenic. Infinity swimming pool was a place from where you never felt like moving. All restaurants had excellent and tasty food. The attached mall had its own charm. Superb service. Worth paying the price.   ,5
"Stayed here for a night as we wanted to check out the infinity pool. When we got to hotel there were no hotel staff to help us with luggage and in trying to manage our luggage and opening the door to the hotel lobby, I scraped the skin and part of my nail of my big toe. Not the best start to our stay. Upon checking in and letting staff know of the mishap they upgraded our room and sent up a first aid officer to look at my toe which was good customer service. The room they upgraded us to was spacious and had a wonderful view from the 42nd floor. Bathroom was huge. The infinity pool was amazing to say the least. The best time to be at the infinity pool is at sunset - just spectacular! Only thing is it can get crowded and eating at Marina Bay is very pricey!!! ",4
The hotel is an amazing architectural creation and is a must see if you are visiting Singapore. You ca either see it just from outside for free or pay entrance fees to go to the terrace garden of the hotel.,5
"My favourite hotel! Love it there. The pool and view are amazing. The club package was good value, would recommend. It included afternoon tea, drinks and canapés in the evening (all you can eat) and breakfast.",5
"Amazing hotel, rooms are to a high standard but its all about the roof top pool!!! The views are fantastic both during the day and night. The roof top bar and restaurant also fantastic with good food and excellent service.",5
We stayed there for one night as it was our birthdaypresent to my friend. We had a romm on the 37th floor with garden view which was amazing! Everyone did there best to make it a pleasant stay for us! And on top the view from the Pool was as amazing as we expected it. ,5
"We had a convention for our business and we stayed here for almost a week. I loved the view from our room, it was so beautiful and relaxing. The rooms were spacious, very comfortable and very clean. The pool was the best, I loved the view overlooking Singapore. I would love to come back here.",5
"Excellent Property, Excellent Service  No doubt, it's very expensive but, it's real Value for Money. Going to Singapore would not be complete if one doesn't stay here at least for two nights. It's roof top swimming pool on the 57th floor is one of the architectural marvels of the world.",5
"Ok, so some people had a few negative comments...but nothing comes close to MBS for the unique mile high experience, in every way! Staff who could not do enough to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Small room heating issue resolved efficiently. The Club Room Upgrade at 160SD worth every penny, and choose to stay as high as you can, we were on floor 53...check it out and spend out. Best rooms have to be the Club suite overlooking the City for stunning evening cityscape, Infinity pool on rooftop floor 60, I guess, is not unsafe at all, it's simply stunning to swim to the edge overlooking the city, with narrow terracing and safety barrier to prevent accidents. Club55 deal includes free drinks between 5pm and 7pm including good quality Champagne and canapés so good many…",5
"Who hasn't heard of the Marina Bay Sands.  This is a fantastic hotel to stay in. We booked this hotel for a few days to break up our 6 week trip onto Australia and Thailand.  When lining up to check in we were lead to the VIP check in just so we didn't have to wait. It's the attentiveness that makes a hotel a great hotel.  The hotel itself is very vast, with plenty of shops and restaurants to chose from even a train station below. Meaning lots of people pass through daily.  When you think of the Marina Bay Sands you think of the infinity pool at the very top overlooking Singapore. Luckily only reserved for guests staying at the hotel. Wow just wow, it can get busy up there with people waving selfie sticks but there is  plenty of loungers.  With a small number of restaurants for…",5
"The hotel is one of the best, the pool is amazing and worths the trip also offers a good set of discounts if you go shopping. The food is not bad is disgusting in every sense, disgusting and expensive it is so bad that after a few days my wife and me were longing for McDonalds.  The air conditioner in the room is pretty old so it never worked, when we asked them to fix it, the guy told us to get used to it. It is a massive hotel where nobody even tries to focus on the customer. We were going for our honeymoon told the concierge and front desk and we didn't get even a congratulations card. Finally, this is not a hotel but an amazing swimming pool that comes with a really lousy service. ",2
Rooms are spacious and the view is splendid. With shopping & dining galore it's practically a one stop paradise. Rooms facing the city had a nice night view but the rooms facing the sea had a better daytime view. I went with high expectations and MBS didn't disappoint.,4
"yes yes, so the biggest reason we stayed was to experience this pool... loved it...   also really enjoyed our family room. spacious room with views of the gardens by the bay. 1.5 baths, 1 king, 2 twins which are low for the kids, kitchenette, and living area, not to mention the terrace.  unfortunately we only stayed a night, but would come again as the family room has good value.  also cool that it's connected to the mall, so food choices are many. you won't run out of things to do here...",5
"This hotel totally blown my mind! It's pretty obvious that many people pick the hotel because of the view and the pool (which of course is a good reason it's totally mind blowing! Stunning view, amazing pool). Also worth mentioning is that the rooms are super nice, staff is really good and drinks are amazing. We really really enjoyed! ",5
"MBS is amazing, everything about it is fabulous. Staff are more than helpful, its spotlessly clean, my room was huge and very comfortable. The Sky Park was the selling point for me and I wasn't disappointed. Although I never ate in there, all of the Restaurants were well attended which speaks volumes. Travel writers say, Orchard Rd. is the place to shop in Singapore, no way, MBS, has it all. Personally, I can't fault MBS, see for yourself.",5
We were not supposed to stay here as the rooms charges were very expensive but one of my good friend who is together with us during this tour has strongly and forcefully recommended us that we have to stay there even if not suits our budget.  we have no choice but to accept his demand and we stayed there  Till that day we are thankful to him for a wonderful suggestion that he gave for choosing this hotel  The rooms were really big enough to satisfy you. Bathrooms were unbelievably big too. Have no words to say anything bad for this hotel.  Main and most important is the infinite pool on top of the hotel.   Had stayed there is like blessed.,5
"I have often wondered what it is like to be at the top of the Marina Bay Sands (MBS), the iconic building that every one admires from afar, and finally had an opportunity to stay in a Deluxe room last weekend.  Marina Bay Sands hotel has 3 towers - Towers 1, 2 and 3. The check-in counters are at Towers 1 and 3 and the check-in counter was crowded when we reached there. The check-in was orderly and efficient. We were given our key cards and a form where we could do a key-drop at the numerous Express check-out points at the ground floor when we check out. That would save us a lot of time when we check out.   As soon as we inserted our key card into the door, the curtains in our Deluxe room were drawn open automatically. Apparently, the curtains were programmed to close in an…",4
"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands in May 2015, so this review is slightly late. We booked a Deluxe Room to celebrate my dad's 60th birthday, and got upgraded to an Orchid Suite! The room was amazing! We had glass windows from the ceiling to the floor with views of the city and watched the Wonderfull Light Show from the room. The room was huge, with a sitting area and bathroom with separate shower and bath. We even had a view of Gardens by the Bay from the bathroom. The infinity pool had lovely views, but was really crowded. However, we still managed to get lounge chairs and our own private jacuzzi. There is a relatively small gym for the size of the property, and a sauna and hot pool with amazing views in the male and female toilets on the same floor as the gym. My parents were…",5
"Nothing I say about this hotel could do it justice for how amazingly incredible this hotel is. From the moment you arrive, you are treated with the utmost importance to the hotel and as a guest, the staff are there to do anything beyond their means to make your stay as memorable and unforgettable as possible. If you have only one chance to stay here at any time then I suggest you jump at the opportunity and run with it for what it's worth because I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.",5
"I arrived on 12th night and left totally disappointed on 15th afternoon.   First sight after a speedy check in was a long crowded corridor reminding you of Orchard Street on a busy Saturday which makes you wonder whether you have arrived at a five star hotel.  Moshe Safdie's architecture is what motivated me to come and I was not disappointed.   Rooms are well equipped with technologically advanced features and modern conveniences and not lacking in comfort. However, interior decor was boring.   According to in room information Ala Carte breakfast was available at the Restaurent Spago, but not so. Much against my wishes I had to be satisfied with buffet at Adrift and Rise. Surprisingly both charge the same rate but Adrift offers a shorter menu.  Complementary high speed wifi…",2
"There is no question that the Marina Bay Sands is a fantastic property, from its iconic table top swimming pool to the largest and highest end shopping mall on the planet, but if love is in the details they have missed some of the standards of customer service that one would expect from a modest hotel.  Some examples are that the hotel provides free internet to all guests, however it is nearly impossible to connect to and it is so slow it can take 5 minutes just to log on to a website.  The login process is supposed to be simple: room number followed by the 1st 3 letters of your last name.  No luck trying any combination.  I called guest services who said they'd get back to me with a solution and never heard from them.  Finally I got a generic code from the front desk but that…",3
"We stayed at the MBS for around 4 nights. From the moment you arrive you are exposed to nothing less than 5 star service from all of the staff. Everyone is helpful and willing to assist you at all times. Our room was lovely, with beautiful views of the Marina bay gardens and the ocean full of working ships. The Infinity rooftop pool is spectacular and is worth the money alone! You must get up before sunrise and watch it from the infinity pool! The skydeck is amazing at night. They hotel puts on a light and water show every evening which has a theme, its worth seeing. The gym facilities here are fantastic with pretty much a fully equipped gym, with adjoining male/female sauna, steamroom and hot pool. The gym staff are very welcoming, helpful and take the time to get to know you…",5
"This hotel was the highlight of our trip to the Orient.  After a 10 day cruise on the Queen Mary 2 from Hong Kong, we chose to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for two nights!  The pool was awesome and the staff were great!  I didn't want to leave the hotel as it was an all in one vacation by itself.  We stayed at the pool the first afternoon and then when we went back up at night it was a whole different experience as there is a club and two restaurants up there and the lights of the city are beautiful!",5
"This is the only hotel I have stayed in in the world where you pay extra to get 3 people in the room but the bed count doesn't increase. Thats right they sell on line a room for 3 adults for which you pay extra but the extra is only for the swimming pool access not a bed for the 3rd person. I couldn't believe that after paying $100 extra to upgrade from 2 - 3 people but I still needed to pay an extra $119 for a bed for the 3rd person? Also their executive club and pool access is only until checkout which is at 11am. If you are only staying one day don't bother running around to get the rewards deal as it takes 24-48 hours to load the 3% of your spend credit, if you do it though take your passport to the sign up desk. Service is terrible everyone gives differing info. The food at…",3
"I was there for business so decided to come in a few days early and I am so glad that I did.  I arranged for airport pickup which was comfortable and smooth.  I was greeted by name as soon as I got out of the car.  They took me directly to my room and checked me in there!  Talk about great service which only got better... A few minutes later I get a knock on the door - a special delivery of 6 delicious macarons!    Room - perfectly new, clean, roomy with a view of the bay, and patio doors that rolled all the way to the side for an unobstructed view along with a small terrace with roses.  I slept with the door open each night.  :)  Infinity pool - amazing like the photos depict. The drinks are expensive and the service is spotty (we ordered two drinks ahead to combat the slowness…",5
It's everything it was advertised to be. The skypark pool deck is awesome. Rooms in higher floors facing Gardens by the bay gives you a relaxing sight. Staff are all so accomodating especially the Filipinos. They can recognize fellow Filipinos right away and are very warm and pleasant.,5
we were lucky enough to get a stay in one of asias iconic hotels.The view from our bedroom looked over the city skyline and we were treated to a laser light show whilst laying in bed so why switch on the television!We explored the shops and casino and of course a dip in the infniti pool and a champagne breakfast in the morning to top it off.The staff were a1 and if you get the oppurtunity go for it as its an experiance to stay here no wonder David Beckham markets it.its extremely busy so allow some timefor booking ahead a date you require near the top of my hotel experiances!,5
"I have stayed for the fourth time last week in this hotel and just love this place. Each time I stay I find something new to do here and it is never over.  Great hotel, wonderful location, nice service, so much to do. One always feel like coming again and again.",5
"Had an overnight stay here last January with friends as they would want to go to Skypark and see the infamous infinity pool, up close. As I understand that this is a luxury 5 star hotel, it baffles me how the staff assigned at the pool area treats guests. Totally uncouth and not living to its hotel's 5 star rating. While we were in the pool and they were about to close already, we were surprised on how the staffs in the pool area used whistle to call people's attention that the pool is closing. And I'm not just talking about one whistle sound here!   And the high tea and breakfast at Rise, is a hit or miss.   As for the room, we got a nice one facing the bay area which my friends loved. No complains about the room I must say, but overall the management needs to brief their staff…",3
"Having previously visited Singapore and had a wander around Marina Bay Sands we were thrilled to actually stay there this time. This gave us access to the incredible rooftop infinity pool 58 storeys in the sky. We arrived at the hotel at 8.30am but were told we couldn't check in until 3.00pm. We explained we had flown in overnight and were tired and would like our room earlier and the receptionist said we will see what we can do. So we headed up to the pool and got a sun lounger and relaxed. At 11.00am we were told our room was ready. So we managed to get some sleep before exploring the amazing mall attached to the hotel and the waterfront. Breakfast was fantastic and the staff were incredibly courteous. Of course the hotel is vast with 2,500 rooms but it is a spectacle and the…",5
"Everything was perfect at this hotel. It's one of the more expensive hotels we've ever stayed in during our travels but it was absolutely worth the money. The room was very nice, spacious, clean, and well-kept. The rooftop infinity pool was truly breathtaking. The views of Singapore from the room was nice, but pales in comparison to the view on the rooftop. If you want some of the best cityscape pictures you'll take, take them here. Not a single bad thing to say about the hotel.   It is connected to one of the highest quality shopping areas you'll experience outside of Europe.   If you're touring Southeast Asia you know most other countries on your trip will be relatively inexpensive. Do like we did and spoil yourself for at least one night with this once in a lifetime…",5
"Booked this after seeing it being built on tv (mega constructions). We were on the 53rd floor and as you open the door to the room the curtains automatically open to reveal a breathtaking view of the city. The infinity pool on the top floor was worth the visit.  The hotel includes a huge shopping precinct restaurants, theatre and a casino for the general public also has access to the mtr system, unfortunately the reception is amongst this, for me it took away the whole 5 star experience, no personal touch at all. Rooms looked dated despite being a fairly new building. If I was going to Singapore again I would book somewhere in the same location but not this hotel. Location and easiness to get about was perfect though",4
We went for the grand prix so the price was even more expensive. The service was excellent and I dont really have any complaints. they room was fairly standard if a little small- im sure if you had a deluxe room or whatever it would have been better. What your really paying for is the use of the pool which i have to say was bloody fantastic! excellent views and great atomsphere especially at night.,4
"We booked a club room which included breakfast, afternoon tea, and canopies and drinks in the evening. The room was large with an equally large bathroom and shower room. The bed and pillows were really comfortable. The best part was the canopies and drinks each evening - just amazing, so much variety and high quality. The infinity pool was fantastic with the city as its backdrop - although it was always very crowded. I will stay here again if in Singapore.",5
"We visited this and stayed for 2 nights at the grand club city view room. This is a luxury high end hotel that is worth the splurge. The city view is by far more superior than the garden view - so worth the extra dollars if you are staying here. The club access which you get with club rooms is awesome and worth the money to upgrade as the food for breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapés changes daily and is of high quality. The 57 floor offers great views of the Singapore skyline. The infinity pool - speaks for itself and worth going for sunset and sunrise as it offers beautiful views across Singapore.   Only negatives and why the score of 4. The hotel check in process was not smooth for us. The attitude of the person checking us in was appalling and there was a stuff up…",4
This is the second time I have stayed in the NBS and can say its a fantastic experience and a great hotel. we stayed in a club room and the club experience is great but a little inconvenient if you are not staying in tower 2 as the club room is only in this tower on the 55th floor. The room we had in tower 3 on level 19 was fantastic and large but believe they could do better with the shampoo etc..poor home brand offer. worth the money for the room size the view and the pool experience.,4
Nice hotel with nice staffs. On the first day at Singapore. I don't know how to get to the OCBC Arena. And Bellman escort me to the MRT station.  I loved the rooftop pool here.  Long Chim restaurant is the best place for Thai cuisine in MBS.,5
"The Marina Bay Sands is a luxurious hotel with service to match.  It has beautiful views, restaurants, pools, shops and staff to match.  Thank you to everyone at Marina Bay Sands for our lovely honeymoon stopover - we wish we could have stayed longer!",5
"Overpriced just for the pool experience.  No denial, view is spectacular. For the price, our room only provided a basic shower and a toilet. Check in after 3 p.m., check out 11 a.m. less than 24 hours so we booked two nights.    Our luggage took over one hour to be delivered to our room!!  And we had a 4 month old baby with urgent need to access his suitcase. The TV did not work for the first of the two nights we were there.  Had to phone to get it fixed.  The infinity pool was not as long as I had imagined it to be.  The sheer overcrowding takes away the pleasure....competition for a spot. I made the mistake of going in the evening, the pool  lighting  highlighted every possible piece of solid matter floating around from the overwhelming number of humans who visited that day. …",2
"Best hotel I've ever stayed in! Excellent service, spacious rooms, nice food, amazing city view, stunning infinity pool, hot tubs, bars, restaurants, etc. All you need. Definitely a must-place to stay in Singapore!  You must experience the luxurious Marina Bay Sands Hotel and all it has to offer, otherwise you have not been to Singapore ;)",5
"Marina bay.   Beautiful. Arrived on 4th April in time to celebrate my birthday on the 5th after spending a week in Malaysia. Absolutely astounded with Singapore as a whole but the hotel was out of this world. Large with amazing architectural features and a lovely 57th floor pool with multiple bars. As the place is so busy, check in anytime before 3pm is pretty much impossible but we sat on the patio by the sky restaurant and had a lovely lunch while waiting . Helpful staff, amazing restaurants and bars, worth every penny. Will definitely be back",5
"Big hotel with complete amenities; many food options, entertainment and high end retail shops. Can easily occupy a day there. Rooms are of decent size and comfortable. The infinity pool at roof top offers great view of city... really awesome! ",4
"We spent two nights at the Marina Bay Sands, along with a couple of friends.  We picked the hotel because of the pool, which is truly spectacular, with a view out over Singapore.  That said, it gets crowded, really crowded, so you need to get out there early to secure a spot.  The view is worth the effort.  All in all it felt like a very nice Las Vegas property, but the hotel is a little off by itself.  Cabs are plentiful.",4
"We splurged for a suite and it was amazing! We had a view of the gardens from our balcony and a view of the city from our bathtub. The design of the room was luxurious and simple.  So many non-guests attempt to get to the rooftop infinity pool so you feel pretty VIP when you are able to swipe in wth your key card.  Another perk to getting the suite is that you get complimentary drinks at happy hour and breakfast in the morning in the lounge. I had a particularly pleasant interaction with Flourish. She was so sweet and interested in learning about my time in Singapore.  Even if you can only afford one night here, I recommend it just for the experience.",5
"We stayed here in 2014 and it was simply amazing. We were upgraded to an even larger suite which took up the entire end of one of the towers. After requesting a room with views of the bay, we were treated to wall-to-wall views of the bay. From the bathroom we enjoyed wall-to-wall views of the ocean and Gardens By The Bay (the light displays are stunning, even from the bath). Every stay is not complete without a visit the rooftop infinity pool. Will definitely return again!!!",5
"The best hotel of Singapore. The architecture, the room size, the pool, The service. Beauty of the hotel is its infinity pool on 57th floor. Hotel guest have free entry. Nice seen of entire Singapore and with all safety precautions are taken.",5
"A great hotel, Amazing amenities, great pool, shopping, wonderful rooms, great outlook but just too big. too impersonal and most guests are there for a day or two. At times you get the feeling you are in Singapore Airport! Great to experience at least once in your life. Checkout, Checkin is easy, and everything works - just gave it four stars due to its size and movement of people!",4
It's a shame you can't pay an entrance fee to get into the infinity pool without staying there .... We tried to book and they where full ..   The infinity pool and universal studios was the only reason we where going to Singapore ...    But we could not get into the pool .... Also it is rediculously expensive ...    We had one drink (Not each just 1 ) and a coffee     cost 50$ with tip ....        ,3
"The beat thing about Marin Bay is the swimming pool in the 57th floor, gives you an outstanding view of Singapore. Too good rooms very spacious and amazing food. Basically the best place to stay in Singapore even though you have to pay little extra for it, its actually worth it.",5
"Our first approach with the hotel was not one of the best as when we arrived they were carrying on some works with an hydraulic hammer and the lobby was noisy to a point you could not speak. The lobby itself has more the feeling of an airport terminal than a hotel lobby, it's all other than cosy. The hotel is gigantic in the American way so long queues for check-in/check-out and a lot of people traffic everywhere. Don't expect any personalised service. The rooms we were given were nice and spacious, with a balcony and sea view, which I appreciated, don't know if city view are regarded as more upscale, hove no idea. The room itself is a nice 5stars hotel room, kind of plain in style but comfortable. Big bathroom with alla amenities.  Main reason to come to this hotel, the rooftop…",4
"This hotel is like a one stop package, they have great resto, great rooftop pool, wonderfull view, Shopping mall with great merchant and so near to great attraction. I can spend one whole day just to play at this place. The room is nice and their service is decent. The price is quite high but it is worth it. What a great Place to visit.",4
"The hotel is nice. The view is wonderful from The rooms. The hotel is central to downtown and easy to reach. The subway station is under the hotel.  Sure the pool is amazing, but the hotel has 2.500 rooms. That means, there are no quiet spots except your own room. The pool is full of people taking selfies. There are limited free spots to sit or swim.   The restaurants provide good food. The people working here are very friendly, even their English is often limited.   The casino is terrible. Feels like being in a drug addiction hell. So many empty faces, people smoke, spit on the floor - no nice atmosphere. ",4
"I spent 6 days at the hotel over Easter long weekend. Overall Marina Bay Sands was a lovely hotel and a good experience to have. Bucket list ticked! The infinity pool alone is worth the stay! There were however a few downfalls that should be highlighted. Staff are very friendly and courteous. Suggestion, staying in tower 1 seemed to be the better option, great views, better wifi signal and larger rooms. Comfy beds. The rooms are very nice but considering the price, I've stayed in better for cheaper. There was also an issue with the shower flooding the rest of the bathroom but staff were quick to come clean it up.  The pool. Where to start with this amazing pool. The view is fantastic. Solo travellers don't despair no need for a selfie stick there are plenty of people and staff…",4
"The hotel is very nice and you will surely pay the premium for it. Check in was easy and fast. The rooms bright and clean. Ok let's get straight to meat and potatoes the pool, I'm sure 70% of the people who stay here do so for the pool. The view was unmatched with any pool I've ever experienced, with that being said it was very busy and crowded. Please be advised this is a monstrosity of a hotel, it has a high end shopping mall, casino which allows smoking, over 100 restaurants.",4
"This hotel is luxury hotel, you can enjoy the facility here. Hot tub at your big bathroom, chocolate and fruits in your room as welcome food.   In the upper floor, you can find massage. But you need to pay the fee, which is quiet expensive.  Also very well known swimming pool that we always find it crowded everytime we go there, at the upper floor. You can see the city while you're swimming.   The main entertainment here is the casino. You will need to bring your passport everytime you enter the casino, no need to pay. But for playing, of course! But you can have free Milo, tea, coffee, soft drink. And you cant take picture here. Better you wear jacket if you go there at the noon. You will find it's cold especially when you loose a lot. Know your limit!  Since the hotel is near…",4
"Stayed here for a week in March 2016.  In my opinion its the only place to stay in Singapore.  We stayed in a Club room which is a higher standard room on the higher floors and comes will special privileges i.e.speedy executive check in, you can have enterence and your breakfast  in Club 55 (located on level 55 in tower 2) which has the best views, you get afternoon tea with non alcoholic drinks free between 2-4pm and canapes and free drinks, including alcohol and champagne, between 5-7 pm, garment pressing & international newspapers and magazines. The hotel is amazing with the rooms spread over three towers.  The higher the room the better the view.  The hotel has a huge shopping mall attached The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, and a casino and event plaza and MasterCard…",5
Wonderful contrast from the real Singapore to the modern world.  Our hotel had a fabulous view of the Marina Bay and the shopping was excellent.,5
"Lets be honest, the only reason you'd stay here is for the rooftop pool, and it is amazing and lives up to its expectations. Other parts of the hotel are good but the pool is its big selling point! Some nice restaurants can be found around the hotel and shopping is excellent! ",5
"In between I'm the third time in this Hotel and I like it very much. The rooms are really nice designed and equipt. The service is excellent. What i do not like is the breakfastarea in the lobby. Thats for me too noisy and too crowded. This is the reason why I have breakfast  in the Sky on 57. This is much better and definitely more relaxed. But overall is this Hotel a food location for shopping, relaxing and gambling. Enjoy  ",4
"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our holiday in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore for 3 weeks in total.  This hotel with its unique architecture and the infinity pool on the roof across the three towers, has become an iconic symbol for Singapore.  The infinity pool was very crowded during the weekend, so we swam on Monday morning when it was not crowded. The views of the city and Gardens by the Bay from the rooftop are spectacular.  The access to Gardens by the Bay, through an overhead pedestrian bridge from the Hotel, is a nice feature. Our room had views of the Gardens, which we preferred.",5
I stayed here for 3 nights as I was catching up with friends. I stayed the first night by myself in a river view room on the 24th floor and the views were amazing. Room was great with plenty of space and the bed was extremely comfortable. Once my friends arrived we moved to a suite which was huge and had a massive outdoor deck. Only issue was it was not river facing and on the lower level so the view on the deck was of the main road. With the doors closed you could not hear any traffic but it was not as nice as the view I had in my single room.   The hotel is a monster and you could spend all your time in Singapore just sitting at the roof top pool. Of course the views are amazing and the pool is fantastic. It can get a little hectic but I wouldn’t say it was off putting. The…,5
The staff here are fantastic from the time you check in until the time you leave. We were regulars at club 55 for breakfast during our stay and the staff are all amazing. On our daughter's 21st birthday they surprised her by singing happy birthday and even giving her a cake. Our room had an amazing view facing the Merlion and was lovely and spacious. Our house keeper for the whole duration of our stay was Chui hao (sorry if I spelt it wrong) he was amazing. Everyday surprising us with fabulous towel animals making our stay very memorable. The hotel is within close vicinity to everything which was great. We loved staying here and would stay here again when visiting Singapore.,5
Indeed Marina Bay Sands exceeds anyone's top of the line expectations!! They really make you feel like royalty. Our room was amazing it even came with a butler!!! The facility has so many amenities it is really easy for one to get lost in their world. The infinity pool was everything i thought it would be! The staff friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel to anyone while they are visiting Singapore!,5
"I stayed for 3 nights as a birthday treat for my 20-something aged son who was eager to enjoy the pool.  I found the property no different than a 5 star business class hotel - very nice, but rather sterile with ho hum decor typical of a Radisson Blu, Hyatt, etc.  This hotel could have been in Las Vegas -  no personality reflecting Singapore.  We did enjoy our room with views of Gardens by the Bay.  Pool was best in the early AM hours where lap lanes are made available in one section of the pool from around 6 AM - 8 AM.  As swimmers, we enjoyed that.  Food and drink service was available, but the servers were over worked during the peak times.  We tried for 15 or more minutes just to flag a server on several occasions.  Lots of families and young couples enjoying the space.  I…",4

The hotel is connected to a casino, convention center and enormous multi level shopping mall‎ . Rooms with access to the club lounge on the 55th floor are an excellent choice. The lounge presents substantial food and drink  options throughout the day including buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails with canapés. The view from the lounge is breathtaking.

"This hotel is stunning, the rooms are great, with superb views. The staff are so helpful and accommodating, we got an early check in  at 9.30 which was appreciated after a very long flight. The infinity pool on the top of the hotel is amazing. Nice treat to stay here, but a little pricey.",5
"I arrived at Singapore recently with my family. We had stayed at Marina Bay Sands and I can tell you, my stay was amazing! There were friendly staff, nice amenities and a huge room. My view was facing Gardens By The Bay which was marvellous. Our breakfast was on the 55th floor with a nice view. Really wish they would lower the prices a bit so that could make me stay again.",5
"I stayed here with my friend to end our backpacking trip. We figured we would end it in luxury. Of course the main attraction and probably the only reason we wanted to stay here was because of the pool. Which was outstanding. People complain of how busy it is and ill admit, ita busy, but i wouldnt say over crowded. Especially considering how many rooms are there i would say there was lots of space. Maybe it was just good timing for us. We ordered food through room service and ate at the breakfast buffet on the roof. It was all amazing. ",5
"I had a great time in a great hotel. All the staff are very helpful and friendly, and there are a lot of staff. The rooms with city view and the infinity pool were simply amazing. The price is incredibly high, mainly because of the pool. For the first time the price is ok, but too high for a second stay. Without the pool I would not pay more than $150 per night.",5
"We stayed at your hotel on 28th Mar 2016. The view is Garden By the Bay. The view is excellent. The infinity pool is perfect. This hotel is the BEST hotel in Singapore that I've ever stayed. The stay was gorgeous and everything was perfect except my son left his watch at your hotel property. Not until we arrived Changi Airport for Hong Kong, then my son found that he left the watch. My secretary called the next day morning and initially talked to Ms Rieta Yap, a very capable, efficient lady who patiently listened during our dialogue. I am so overwhelmed when she told me that my son’s watch was being located and Rieta then proceed to get in touch of the mail centre to arrange it to be delivered back to me in Hong Kong. The watch is not valuable but it does meant a lot to my son…",5
"Very busy places it ha lot of people milling around in the foyer. Rooms are very spacious and generally clean. Infinity pool is amazing. Breakfast was lovely even though we had better in Dubai. The casino is a big letdown. Punters are  casually dressed in shorts and flip flops. Worst of all, they are allowed to smoke. Cigarette smoke and ash polluted the air. I love to go back for the gambling but maybe give it a miss to stay healthy without having to inhale second hand smoke. ",4
"We are regular Club Room guests of this hotel since when it first opened. It has always been pleasure to stay at the Club room. However, my recent visit to this hotel has now completely changed my perception of its quality. It has now turn into a touristy orientated hotel, the quality of food has dropped and even with the pool. All the dining area for Club room guests are no longer on skydeck or 57th floor, they have now moved to 55th floor and the standard and is definitely dropped. The dining area at the skydeck turn into some night party goer look and it is extremely disturbing to any hotel guests who have young kids. Absolutely disappointing. Club room guests were supposed to be treated as ""VIP guests"" but honestly, no VIP feel can be gained through the service I received.…",3
I don't usually bother writing reviews for hotels but I will definitely make an exception for Marina Bay Sands. We stayed here Nov 2015 after a cruise and the hotel turned out to be a main highlight of the holiday. We had booked an Orchid suite as we were only staying for one night so wanted to make the most of the stay. Upon check in because we were early we had to wait a couple of hours (which we didn't mind as there is plenty to see and do in the hotel). When we got back we got asked if we minded upgrading (this was the easiest yes ever). We got taken to the VIP check in desk and got upgraded to a massive suite with a baby grand piano in the lounge. We had a view over the harbour and with such a massive glass window to look out of we didn't miss any of the night time light…,5
"Architecturally unique. A very busy hotel, not for those looking for solitude. Request a high floor otherwise the highway traffic is disturbing. Short walk to local subway, but best to get a taxi as its usually quite warm. Handy to the shopping mall / casino / food court through the arcade accessed underground. The pool area is busy but a mandatory must visit.",5
"As the title of my review states, this hotel and all of its amentities are simply amazing.  The reception is well placed as is the conference and events facilities.  Spread across 3 towers which are linked together by an amazing infinty pool on the top floor, this hotel is simply awesome.  Whether staying for business or as a holiday, I would not hesitate to recommend this once in a lifetime hotel as a destination.",5
"There is nothing like this anywhere else in the world. From the extraordinary hotel featuring a roof top boat shaped facility that includes an infinity pool, to the gardens with manmade trees and much, much, much more.",5
"I wanted to tick off my bucket list staying at MBS and swimming in the infinity pool. The view from the pool was amazing. The room was really nice ceiling to floor windows with great views of Singapore. Very spacious, bathroom was really big. Check in was really easy and staff was very friendly.  Would I stay here again, no I wouldn't.  It is a very busy hotel people everywhere. No where to go if you want quiet or to relax apart from your room. The cost of the room is very expensive. When you want to use the infinity pool you have to go through security barriers which get annoying and not very relaxing  Singapore has a number of 5 star hotels that are much cheaper per night, has less people and a lot more relaxing.",4
Loved it. Very luxourious and the views are unbeliveable. We also enjoyed the infinity pools and had room service that was lovely. Room service not entirely bountiful for the price paid but nice all the same. ,5
"Nice and modern hotel, staying in standard room with no breakfast.  Excellent view from the balcony over looking the gardens by the Bay. Wonderful infinity pool but very crowded with visitors.  Great location but a bit pricey",5
"Don;t miss the Casino in Marina Bays, No entries if you are carrying any foods along with you, Carry your passport.  View from Skydesk is awesome. Take MRT to bayfront station for Marina Bay Sands.",5
"When you walk into MBS it definitely feels like Vegas hotels. Very americanized and just as pricey at living in LA. Despite having a high floor and a city few, the room was small and the bed was really firm. If we would have stayed longer than four days we would have switched hotels.   The infinity pool and the service we received there was amazing, as we spent many hours there the few days we were there. When Dennis, Mahesh and Marecon found out that my husband and I were there celebrating our honeymoon they surprised us with a beautiful drink and thanked us for staying at MBS. They definitely made our pool experience wonderful!",3
"What an incredible hotel, loved everything about it, totally overdone that it's really amazing! The views are incredible, swim in the pool overlooking the city. The rooms are massive, so much space! Very beautifully done.",5
"Spent a nite there and living on 31 floor. View from the balcony was excellent over looking the gardens by the Bay. Balcony was big, unfortunately no outdoor chairs and table. Food is expensive so we had our meals in the shopping mall. The bad experience was when we check out and plan to leave our bags with the concierge, the queue was in a mess. Maybe the hotel has to put in effort to get their act together in managing crowds in the lobby.",4
Whats singapore without visiting the top of Marina bay sands ?   A good property overlooking the merlion on one side and the garden on the other. However its now become too crowded with visitors and the lobby very well represents a railway station.   Be prepared to wait for some time during the checkin.   Two days on this property is good enough to explore all that it offers and enjoy.,5
What a hotel! Staying in just a standard room here is perfectly adequate. all the facilities you could want with a high standard. The experience was incredible. The sky park is something I will never forget. You can't stay anywhere else on your first trip to Singapore,5
Nice view with the 57th floor Infinity pool. Night view is awesome. The room is spacious and cleaned. Have pleasant stay with my group. Although is pricely but is a good experience in Singapore. Staff is friendly and wifi is speedy.I stayed here at 2013 December.,5
"Having read a substantial number of reviews, I knew that MBS was a Vegas-style establishment - large, extravagant and with thousands of people everywhere.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and thought that despite the number of people, MBS was well managed, clean, but not entirely efficient (although it tries to be). The check in queue was definitely long, and the check in process took 20 minutes with little interaction between the customer and the staff - the staff seemed to be frantically typing away for the entire time.  We stayed in a Premier City-View room and thought that it was spacious, clean and well presented. We really enjoyed the amazing view of the city, especially at night - overlooking the Marina Bay.  The price you're paying of course, reflects the Infinity Pool,…",5
"It is the second time I have reviewed Marina Bay Sands. Given I was there 1 year ago I thought maybe things have changed.   But no, it is still outstanding and all the staff are still so attentive and polite. At Club 55 they all refer to to you by Mr and Mrs (name). Thanks to Muhairan at Club 55 for his exceptional service. The housekeeping staff are also experts in their area, and they just seem to know when the best time to service your room with the minimal or no interruption to you.   Everything about this hotel is exceptional. We have been coming here for a number of years to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary and we will be booking again and looking forward to our return, so I don't have any hesitation in recommending this hotel.   Thanks Marina Bay Sands. ",5
"Very nice and modern hotel . Intelligent rooms with automatic curtains also weight sensitive minibar and breathtaking view.  You can upgrade room to upper floors in only 57 s$- The only annoying thing is crowd .  You have to waits 10 min or more for having a words with front desk!! Also the man attraction of the hotel ( infinity pool) is always crowded and noisy !!! There is no dress policy !! And Too many people and children are always at the pool .  Considering only pool without scenery,  it is not clean and you think that you are in 3 star hotel !!!",3
"I finally got to stay at MBS this year after so many years of flying back to Singapore. I can say I was impressed by the whole building but it was a bit over rated. The pool is ALWAYS packed with people, screaming children on one side. Really cool view but small space. The mall was gigantic and lots of options. I would say this is modern Singapore go out and explore more!!",4
"TOOOO CROWDED, TOO COMPLİCATED, TOO EXPENSİVE  Yes the infinity pool is wonderful but only for pictures. very crowded with lots of children.   The location is good; walking distance to a lot of tourist attractions",3
"Every time I would go to Singapore, I would think to myself that at some point I need to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. It is a Landmark, it is a Legend, it is a phenomenon, it is the pinnacle and it is what dreams are made of. All of these thoughts held true in my head until I actually decided to stay here.  I will summarize in one sentence what this hotel is, ""It is a highly industrialized and mass scale tourist processing center, period, and it does so very well and is a definite 5 star in doing that"". A hotel with more than 2,500 rooms and you would still expect 5-star personalised service? My friend you must be dreaming. The check-in queue is a like a mini zoo with lines going like snake for 100-200 meters. And the Infinity pool (which is really awesome guys) is very crowded…",2
"At the check in desk we were welcomed by a friendly lady by the name of Jin Ju's. She immediately took care of us and the check in procedure went of as smooth as can be. Our rooms were perfectly situated on the 49th floor with beautiful views. The two days we stayed there was perfect. Relaxing at the roof top pool deck, great food and drinks what more can one ask for. Great service around the pool area and again friendly staff. If you would like to spoil yourself and family this is the place to be.",5
"This hotel was definitely worth the price tag! Loved the infinity pool experience - the views were amazing, both day and night. We stayed in the deluxe room with the garden view, it was very beautiful and spacious, staying in this hotel is like taking you to another world. Absolutely loved the experience!",5
"Fantastic experience! Everything that you can find on this hotel is amazing. The room, the view, the place itself. Best view from the room is the Gardens by the bay. The infinity pool on the rooftop is best during sunset and sunrise, very refreshing and not that crowded. Just don't forget bring 200 SGD for the room deposit. Don't worry it is refundable. :)",5
"A must once in your life ! We have been very lucky to stay at the 52nd floor. The view, the room and the infinity pool are fabulous ! Excellent service at the reception and swimming pool.  Breakfast a bit disappointing. Noisy, crowded and don't come the last half and hour as they stop garnishing the buffet.",5
"We arrived at 1pm and they said they are very busy and the room would not be ready until 3pm. I know you have 3,000 rooms and it is not easy, but we are paying S$500 for a room here. It is not chicken feed and you have been open since 2011 or so. It is not like it is a new experience for you to be busy.  Then when we got our room, the porter carried our suitcases up grudgingly, like he was not paid to do this job. Then we saw that the toilet, shower and bath tub were not separated by any curtains or glass walls. We were very careful but after my wife and I showered the whole toilet was still flooded. We had to tip toe in there.  Next day we went out but by the time we came back at 2pm, the toilet was still flooded. Nobody had come to make up the room the whole morning we were…",2
"Infinity pool,  Intecontinental Cuisine,  Free Flow of Drinks 😜 tbis places exudes luxury in a World Class Scale, we enjoyed the Service,  MassAge and The Lion King Musicale!  A place for couples, business and FAMILY!  A MUST VISIT hotel not only for family getaway, also for Business, Shopping, eating, pictures, entertainment but also Casino! 😜",5
"We arrived at the hotel at 6AM after a long-haul flight. We had booked a Club Delux room at around $700 a night - a bit of a treat on a 24hr stop over in the City. We were told our room was not ready but they would attempt to allow us to check in as soon as possible. They took my mobile number and email and said they would let me know the minute it was ready. We were invited to visit the Club facilities on the 55nd Floor. Eight hours later at 2PM in the afternoon, after repeated visits to reception we were eventually told a room was ready! I received no email, SMS or call - I only found out when I went to reception and asked.  In my conversation with the hotel staff, I was informed that their terms and conditions state that check-in is from 1500hrs onwards. They advise you to…",2
"With the hotels swimming pool always listed as one of top hotel pools to visit, I wanted to stay at the hotel, so that I could visit the pool myself.  (If you don't know, you have to be a staying guest to access the pool.)  Hotel was easy to get to riding subway from airport.  Staff were friendly and room was big and comfortable.  I booked a garden view room (which cost less than marina or harbor view rooms) .  It turned out to be very good choice.  I had very good view of Gardens by the Bay.  Here is a thing about paying more for marina view room.  If you are staying at hotels like Mandarin Oriental or Conrad, which area across marina from Marina Bay Sands, you want a marina view room, so that you can get a beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands and Supertree at Gardens by the Bay.…",3
"The check in was a lot quicker and easier than a lot of the reviews on here make out. We only waited in line for about 5 minutes and there was a lot of staff working very hard to keep it this way. The gentleman checking us in was excellent and after asking if we want a city or garden view, he gave us an upgraded room which had both. A wonderful view of the city from the bedroom and then the gardens from the bathroom which had a large bath right in the window. A much better room than we paid for and were very grateful.  Everything about the room and service was above par and we loved our stay here.  The view from the pool is truly spectacular however it is very crowed which took away from the relaxation a little bit. It was nice to experience but I wouldn't stay here for a long…",5
"I stayed here for two nights in a Club room, giving me free access to breakfast, afternoon tea, evening canapés and all day free drinks in Club 55 on the 55th floor.  The room was spacious and well equipped with a smallish balcony overlooking the sea - no seats or loungers on the balcony.  The hotel is enormous, with its three towers, and the casino and shopping area make it incredibly large indeed - pretty much ""Vegas sized"". I guess my main note of disappointment would then be that the pool area is really not very large, and it is a kind of tourist destination in its own right - with every hotel guest trying to look at the infinity pool view.   It's also not a particularly friendly pool area.   However, the weather in Singapore means it's hard to sit out for too long anyway…",5
"As this hotel is so highly recommended In was as well curious as sceptical upon arrival. But the Marina Bay met every expectation I had. First of all the hotel is huge and when you enter the lobby it feels a little bit Las Vegas (minus the slot machines...) as there is so much going on. If you look for a romatic getaway without other people: do not go there;-) Keeping all the fuzz in mind the hotel is mindblowingly good organized. The check in went surpisingly quick (but be prepared to queue if you arrive at certain peak times of the day). We got a room upgrade which surely made our stay even more special as we got a room high up overlooking Marina Bay. The room was big, fantastic bathroom, great views, complementary water every day. Service was perfect throughout our stay and…",5
"Unlike some who have complained about the impersonal experience, spartan rooms... well, all I can say is that this is one of the more memorable places we have stayed at.  We originally booked a Deluxe room, but were given a Premier room on the 9th floor facing the city.  Higher up, and facing the gardens, would have been better, but to get a good view one goes to the 57th floor anyway.  The Infinity Pool is unreal -- a great reason to stay there!  The attached shopping mall is interesting; we ate at Beanstro for breakfast.  The coffee shop on the ground floor of the hotel dishes out tasty baking goods.  We really liked MBS and would go back!",5
"As many others, we wanted to stay a night here to experience the pool and the sunset / view from our city facing room. The hotel does have a 5 star 'air' about it - reminded me a bit of an upmarket Vegas Casino and Hotel.   We were told that check in actually started at 12 (not 3) as we dropped bags off at 11:15, so you may get lucky and get a room earlier. We decided to stick with the plan and returned at 2 for a very swift check in. We were in the room, unpacked, ordered our own fridge and in the rooftop pool by 3. Good work.  The hotel does have lots of families staying, and lots of people in the pool are there for the photo, so don't expect a relaxing beach type resort. It ain't that sort of place.   We really enjoyed relaxing in our room (take your own champagne), watching…",5
"The hotel is beautiful. Waiting in line to check in for 50 minutes... is not. It's very impersonal [it's a brand thing...] and you are just a number that occupies a room. The pool is what makes the hotel worth the money. Well ok, the photos you can take from the pool. A saving grace is that the pool is open until 11pm. It can get quite cold up there at that time. The breakfast is ok- better than average but not as good as other properties this company owns around the world. I booked this as a birthday treat and while the pool was so much fun, that was about it. The rooms are no better than anywhere else, though the beds are comfy. Worth the 'once in a lifetime' experience though and the Facebook profile pictures that ensue...",4
"Pros -Pool: not much to at to the gazillion reviews - one of the most epic infinity pools ever.  -Location: great to explore the city. You have tons to do walking distance (bay gardens and the whole marina area). Not far from the rest of the city, and easy to get to from the airport.  -Room: We got upgraded and the room was huge, two bathrooms, living room, etc.  Cons -At times it feels as a shopping mall, due to the amount of people (2,500 rooms).",5
"I spent 2 nights and 3 days in MBS and it was absolutely unpleasant. Before i start, i would like to say that I am never a guest/customer who attempt to create a scene and make the job of the hotel difficult. In fact, I am a customer who attempt to compliment and make pleasantries knowing that working in this service industry is not easy. But I think reasonable feedback is necessary; there were 3 incidences all together that ruined my entire stay and overrode any reasons to come back to this hotel.  1) The service in front desk in MBS is notorious for bad service.; While the concierge was checking me in, I told him that I would like a sea view (since my previous stay i was in garden view) and he completely ignored me. He was sighing and had very stoic expression. When I attempt…",1
"Worth a stay for one night just to swim in the infinity pool on the 57th floor but it is very very busy. All of the sunbeds were occupied by just after 8am, however there was a turnover. Worth going up there too for the sunrise and for a drink at the bar.",4
"Marina Bay Sands is not just a hotel, it is a huge playground for all the ages. Large rooms, worth having city view which is absolutely stunning... Food, service, location, infinity pool, all is great. We really enjoyed our stay and fell in love with Singapore! ",5
"When the front staff told me sorry, she was looking at her computer. Although I heard sorry from her I was very upset to her bad manner.  It was because of their fault when I check-in. Although they knew about this, they were just busy. This hotel is huge but, just super busy atmosphere and super busy staffs.  The cost is not worth it and the service is not luxury.  I' ve sometimes stayed Sands caz my hubby's gambling but, never ever felt good about staffs, amenities, beds, towers.  No hope to meet very polite and . I will not be here anymore. ",1
We Loved everything about that place especially the infinity pool!! wow what an amazing place and the view is awesome. Our room had a great view! Excellent location and very helpful and friendly staff.,5
"We stayed in a club room on tower 3 (50th floor) facing the city. Great view! We had informed the hotel that we are on our honeymoon, but we did not receive any kind of notice or attention from the hotel staff regarding that: Not very 5 star standards! The room was big and classy though.  The main reason for us booking the hotel was the pool which felt actually more like beeing on a packed Caribbean cruise with people making noise and kids jumping and splashing. The sun chairs were placed right next to each other and the quality of the chairs was not good as their backrests kept collapsing all the time (not very relaxing!). There are basically three pools connected and only one of them is ""adult only"". Even staying near the adults pool, you still can't avoid hearing all the…",3
"This was my second visit to MBS, the first being 2yrs ago. It was both mine and my mother's birthday so we decided to have a weekend away and I really wanted my mum to experience the infinity pool at MBS. Although the hotel is extremely big in size, it does have the rich, decedant, luxurious feel of many other 5 star hotels around Asia. Whilst we waited for our room to be ready, we had breakfast in Rise Restaurant. Again, i wasn't impressed. We were hurried in and out as they had to start packing up for lunch service. I wasn't 'Wow'ed' by the variety on offer. The rooms are extremely clean and big in size - our luggage was waiting for us which was good. We were also fortunate enough to have a room with a balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. We made our way up to the…",3
"We stayed at MBS for one night to experience the infinity pool. Needless to say, it was definitely worth the hype!  Location:  MBS is located in a prime location. Great view of Gardens by the Bay and overlooks the skyline across Marina Bay. Easily accessible with a direct link from the MRT station. You can definitely spend a whole day here exploring the shops at Marina Bay.  Infinity Pool: The infinity pool was the sole reason for our stay at MBS. It's definitely something to check of your bucket-list. Yes it is over-runned with tourists and is seems overrated, but if you are willing to splurge, it is definitely worth the hype.  The weather was great and the sky was clear during our stay so the view from the edge of the pool was second to none. During our one night stay, we went…",4
"Stayed here for a short conference.  Hotel building was impressive and the conference ran well.  Food was a bit hit and miss - dinner at Spago was lovely (they even went out of their way to present me with a birthday cake), but breakfast was nothing special.  Location was great - I think I prefer Singapore to Hong Kong - the infinity pool was a first, the evening music show on the waterfront was spectacular and the sky gardens lovely for a walk.  The room (in Tower 3) was clean and tidy, but nothing special, the hotel concourse was always teeming with people and the automatic check-out didn't work as I had to chase the invoice.  All-in-all, a great hotel, but I felt it was missing something to justify the expense.",4
"Spent one night here post cruise as I really wanted to swim in that infinity pool.  Only residents can gain access and this is vigorously enforced so checking in was the only way of doing this.  It did not disappoint either. As we disembarked early in the morning we were at the hotel by 10am, however we were checked in with no problem and given a room upgrade.  We had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the garden – but actually this floor looks over a motorway.  Had it not been for the fact that we were only there one evening and the hotel had checked us in so early I would have asked for a higher floor.  Everything about the room was fabulous it even had automatic sensors on the curtains!  It was all very luxurious alas we didn’t have long enough to take advantage of it all.",5
"The most beautiful rooftop view ever seen. ..the next Bar is real awesome for aperitif as well. If you cannot stay at this hotel, don't pay for the rooftop view visit..go to the restauran/bar and make the aperitif. .same view. ..same cost but with a drink included.. ",5

"Went to Singapore for business and stayed at the Sands. I got the rooms discounted for 350S$ a night. Casino was top notch, but you have to bring your passport to avoid paying $100S$ (locals pay this). Rooms were very clean, entire hotel was clean. It was full of people from all over asia. Best Part was the signature infinity pool on top of the building which gives you a commanding view of Singapore which you can take in-between laps.",5
"  This hotel is an iconic hotel in Singapore.  Standing 57 storied high it's hard to miss on the skyline  We had booked 3 nights here although only spending 2 night actually at the hotel, we booked an extra night due to the early fight arrival and we wanted an early check in. Because we were very early arriving there was little delay in checking in and we were given a room of the 50th floor in tower 3. This hotel is massive, 3 huge towers and a huge structure on the roof that amongst other this contains the worlds longest and highest infinity pool in the world as well as a number of restaurants and bars.

We went straight to the incredible pool and had some drinks and much needed sleep. The waitress service was good and the drinks were tasty. Our room was very comfortable, we particularly enjoyed how the curtains opened when you entered the room. We had a great view overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. We went to The Shoppes in the evening, although they were all a bit too high end for us, it was nice having a look around. We had some drinks and nibbles at the Flight Bar, which again was excellent. We had breakfast at Adrift, which provided a good selection of food. We used the pool the next afternoon, but didn't enjoy it as much as it was so busy. It…",5

Did not have the chance to stay but i had the privilege to go for a drink at the swimming pool. just amazing. out of this world views and great service. a must see in singapore even if you do not stay,4
Got two interconnected rooms as we were a family of four. Checked in after 3:00 p.m. which was alright since we checked out late from our previous hotel. The infinity pool is amazing. The rooms are spacious and the view from our room which was located on level 42 was incredible.  Ask for a room that faces the city skyline rather than gardens by the bay.  Do not take the family room as its on level 2. The only negative of sorts is that it's pretty expensive and breakfast is chargeable. ,5
From the moment we arrived in the early hour of the morning the staff were very helpful and accomodating. The room was very spacious. Awesome views. Sensational swimming pool. You must experience Marina Bay Sands ,5
I had never been to Singapore. what drive me to give the review is that this Hotel was build by our company and from the beginning of its construction I was fascinated by its design and speed of construction. Our company wins many awards for this building and some of the awards it get before the completion of the building.,5
stayed at this hotel recently for a day last week..great view and nice rooms and worth the price. checkin and checkout was so smooth and the infinity pool s the real deal.. customer service was great except that I had to encounter some not so friendly LIFE GUARDS (the pair that worked on the AM shift on Mar 29th) when asked for some assistance.,4

"Wow words are hard to describe our stay on the 13th floor of Marina Bay Sands.  From the moment we arrived till the moment we checked out everything was first class.  The staff, the rooms, the shops all fantastic but the infinity pool was amazing and well worth the cost of our stay.  The views are breathtaking and even better at night.  Prices in the bar are very overpriced but so is everything in Singapore.  Definitely enjoyed our mother/daughter stay here (even though it was only for two days) will be back again one day - thanks again for a memorable, happy stay in your wonderful Hotel",5
"While in Singapore you have to visit this building. The viewing is on floor 57 and is 20 Singapore dollar. Little tip if you plan to eat in the restaurant/bar then you don't need to pay the 20 dollar.  If not, should not tell you this but jump in the lift with a guest of the hotel and once they swipe there pass and press the floor they are going to  kindly ask them to press floor 57. We did this but then spent 150 Dollar at the bar so they got there money back",5
the swimming pool on the top of the buildIng is very nice. a view from the observation deck is stunning. there are so many choices of food to choose from for the buffet. staffs are friendly and ready to help.,5

We opted for a club room to obtain high-floor and city view - and indeed we got a breathtaking view over the city from the 49th floor. The room was huge, with all comfort and amenities. As we wanted twin beds and only rooms with one king-size bed were available, the couch were opened at no charge to arrange for a second bed. Reception staff was friendly and the concierge very helpful with information and small services.

I wanted to stay at the Raffles but it was fully booked. Everyone I spoke to recommended the Marina Bay Sands as an alternative.  The hotel is nice, very clean and in a great location. It has its own shopping mall attached that has all the high end stores. Lots of really good restaurants too. The staff were lovely and very helpful BUT...... I would only give 4 stars because it was far too crowded. For example, to check in and out you had to wait in long lines of people.

We spent almost all of our time in Singapore at this hotel's amazing rooftop infinity pool, eating at one of the many great restaurants or shopping/eating/exploring the adjoining complex.   Quite a few reviews seem to comment that the infinity pool is very crowed - however I didn't find it overly crowded at all even though it was a busy easter weekend and it felt like we had plenty of space to hang out, swim and enjoy the views.  The other guests we encountered were happy, friendly and respectful.  It's a huge pool and the 'adults only' part of the pool (about 1/3 of the pool) is also a place you can go if you want a slightly quieter experience.  Other than the unbeatable views, the best parts about the pool…",5

"We stayed in an orchid suite with city views.  This suite was massive, which overlooked the Merlion and part of the river.  We awoke each morning to the city scape.  Included in your room is access to the club suite on the 55th floor.  The breakfast was a treat and you really felt like royalty.   The city of Singapore has spectacular architecture, including the colonial Raffles hotel and the must have Singapore Sling.  A visit to the orchid garden is a must and was a spectacular show and collection of orchids. There is no shuttle bus to Orchard Road however the chatty taxi driver took me to Ion for 5.00 dollars.  I spent the day at the shops and wasn't disappointed.   Of course the pool is wow, and fo the little ones there's an area that's glassed in so you don't need to worry. …",5
"stayed at the amazing hotel. The rooms were beautiful and the infinity pool stunning. The best part was the honesty of the housekeeping staff. My teenage son left behind his GoPro and before he had even realised he had left it I had an email saying the had found it. They went to amazing levels to make sure we received it back home in Australia. We have travelled a lot over the years and have left minor things never to be seen again. The housekeeper could have kept this and we would never have worked out where he had left it. thank you , truly amazing staff and hotel.",5
"My partner and I stayed at marina bay sands in a suite recently and were treated like royalty from the very start. The customer service is impeccable and there is really nor much that they won't do to make your stay enjoyable.   The hotel is so clean (like everything else in Singapore), we saw cleaners cleaning windows and artifacts everyday and we were greeted everyday by name & it was all genuine and no fakeness about it.   The restaurant had a nice view and the buffet breakfast had a lot of selection and even there we were greyed each morning by name and with a smile and our orders from previous days were remembered and asked if we would like the same. I was so impressed.   The room was beautiful with a gorgeous view of the gardens with a small balcony. The amenities were…",5
"We arrived at the hotel two days ago staying at Orchid suites(we have two room). The rooms have good space and warm decorations. The beds and amenities were good and comfortable.  However, to my disapointmemt the hotel has restriction toward some nationalities to use casino which i found it quiet insulting. Being a person who is usual casino player at many top destinations around the world including Vegas and Monaco (Vegas only 3 months ago ) i found it insulting to be racism against some specific nationalities.  Even thouh the hotel is nice and one of the kind in term of pool design, but if you travel purpose is not casino, then there are more luxurious hotels in Singapore to enjoy. Keeping in mind the pool is most of the time is too crowded to enjoy and the water is so…",3
"We had a 6 night stay at Marina Bay Sands and so pleased we decided to book our accommodation here.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully presented, room service impeccable.  With a huge variety in choice of restaurants and access to the shopping complex no need to leave if you don't so desire.  totally recommend staying here ",5
"Staying in this iconic hotel was an experience. The location was fantastic - amazing views and lovely to walk around. My husband was working so I explored a lot by myself - the metro was very easy to navigate, exceptionally clean. Singapore itself is incredibly safe but quite an expensive city. The hotel rooms were great - we were on the 42nd floor in the middle tower with views over South China Seas. Bathroom was very spacious - housekeeping was efficient and worked around our needs for later room makeup. The hotel itself is attached to an elaborate shopping centre with indoor canal, gondolas and every exclusive designer shop you could imagine. The hotel is full and buzzing, not peaceful or personal at all.  My huge gripe is the pool area. If you are into taking selfies then…",4
Omggg!!!this place is absolutely stunning best location best views has everything we stayed at ths hotel its pricey but worth every penny we had a room in the middle tower facing the gardens by the bay every night u watch the supertrees theatrical show. Theres a casino in the hotel the train station i didnt want to leave ths place lol ,5
"Marina Bay Sands is amazing. Three towers, 57 storeys,9000 rooms, 150 metre infinity swimming pool 280 metres high, almost 300 shops, 60 restaurants including 10 celebrity ones, an ice skating rink, 2 theatres, giant convention center etc etc.  It is a self contained city rather than a hotel.  Rooms are modern, comfortable, smart in every way.  views over the ocean or Marina - both spectacular in their own way. .  Staying here is a unique experience.  Breakfast choice is an enormous buffet allowing a full breakfast in just about any nationality.  The lifts are the fastest I have ever been inj  They put on a spectacular water and laser display every night.  The food court in the shopping area is brilliant and relatively cheap serving mostly Asian and Italian food.  Make up your…",5
"A great experience and amazing hotel. The infinity pool some is worth the stay. The food at spago is outstanding and the breakfast buffet at rise is fantastic so much choice from all around the world. Great casino, easy access to the mrt and gardens by the bay. Room service was of impeccable standard. Easy to get around to other districts such as little India, Chinatown and klampon glam.  Would recommend to anyone. ",5
"Location  **** (out of max five). Located by the Bay. Expensive Restaurants and Coffee Shops close to the hotel. No supermarket. MRT station Harbour in the basement.  Room. ***** (out of max five). Large room. Large bathroom large  balcony. Infrastructure, Service (internet, reception, pool etc): **** (out of max five). Room very clean. Wonderful swimming pool in the 57th floor. There were people in the pool but it was not crowded and we could take a lot of pictures of the skyline. Other reviews complain about long checkin times but we have waited only five minutes. However in a hotel with 2560 rooms it is possible that some times you have to wait longer. They worked with ten persons on checkin. Excellent internet. Breakfast. ***** (out of max five). Gorgeous breakfast with a…",4
"Perfect location. You have everything that you want there - food, shops, casino, exhibition area, park, and all. I love the pool, and i just realised that this is the only pool i have been to where people just soak themselves, put on make-up and wear swimsuit with accessories - not for swim, but for taking pictures. Well, its beautiful, blend in, make sure you put on your best swimwear for photo session.",5
one of the most amazing hotels that i have been to. It is a must visit if one is in Singapore. The best part of the hotel is its infinity pool and its casino. The boulevard around the hotel happens to be a very nice place to spend your evening.,5
"To be honest, we mostly booked our room so we'd have the chance to use the incredible, iconic rooftop infinity pool, and it did not disappoint. The room itself was beautiful, though, and we had stunning views of the water and Gardens by the Bay. Marina Bay Sands is definitely a splurge, but I'm glad we decided to go for it.",5
"When you book a hotel room, you can tell them your room preference, such as high floor, nice view, etc. The travel agent advises you, that your preference is not guaranteed and often you don't get exactly what you want. But Marina Bay Sands took my preference seriously, and gave me a room on the 48th floor with an excellent view over Singapore skyline. Many thanks for that!!! The room rates for this hotel are expensive, but the value you get is adequate. I had a very spacious appartment ... so when you plan your day, you might want to calculate some extra time for ""commuting"" between sofa, bathroom, your luggage, desk, window, and bed. ;-)",5
Cracking hotel!! Amazing views! Clean! Stunning! Unbelievable breakfasts! Rooftop infinity pool looking over the city!! What a place! I would recommend this to everyone! Staying at this hotel is an experience in itself! The hotel rooms are huge and this hotel extends into shopping areas and lots of places to eat and drink! There is also a casino! Get booking! If you are in Singapore then I would not stay anywhere else but here!! ,5
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands in conjunction with a Conference at the Convention Center.  We stayed in the 3rd tower on the 11th floor overlooking Gardens by the Bay.  What a wonderful view.  Hotel room was generous, bathroom large and nice, linens were nice - but we should have used the pillow choice menu!  Overall the restaurants were good and with a good selection of choices, of course, it's Singapore - so they are expensive.  Room service was not good, so be aware.  Our disappointment is the lobby is always so busy and crowded that there is no ""lobby seating area"" to relax while waiting for someone.",5
"This wasn't my first stay in MBS but it was for my fiancé when he booked a deluxe room for my birthday celebration. After hearing complains about the hotel and experiencing them, I didn't have much expectations for them.  However, I would like to say a big thank you to Vincent, the gentleman who welcomed us to MBS. Not only did he made our check-in fuss free but he also upgraded us to a premier room since it was my birthday. He was very friendly and not to mention, had great memory as well. He still remembered my fiancé's name (even before we provided our room number) when we asked him about the breakfast timing later that night.   The room was fantastic. I didn't stop wow-ing when I first stepped into the room. Big washroom, big bedroom (complete with a sofa and a coffee…",4
this place is just amazing from the second you walk into the building to opening the door to your room with an amazing view of the city and perfect view for sunset. The only way to experience the Marina sands hotel is to stay as the infinity pool access exclusive to guest of the hotel is a whole reason to justify the cost of staying in this hotel! as soon as we were checked in we were changed and by the pool at 1300 and got out at 2000 after sunset! we were allowed to check in earlier and as our return flight was at 2320 we were allowed to checkout at 1300 instead of the usual 1100 at no additional cost. this was my dream hotel and lived up to every aspect I had imagined - its the reason I would return to Singapore again and again and again!,5
"Treated ourselves to a 2 night stay at the end of a 3 week trip to Asia and Australia. It's big and brash but great. Rooms are full of tech which is great but can be a disadvantage the curtains are remote controlled but once both sets were fully closed they clicked really loudly ( room 617 ) so we had to fractionally open them to stop the annoyance. Rooms are a good size with plenty of storage and all the usual amenities. Room was serviced promptly each day. On our day of departure we were able to continue to use the roof top pool and then use the health club changing rooms and showers which were very nice and lovely and cool. The rooftop pool is the highlight with amazing views over Singapore and the infinity pool, service is ok but it does get very busy up there but we had no…",5
"Best in class place,view,food,business,leisure,entertainment..whatever you seek..its at its best..for APAC region..more cities should emulate such a convention zone.. Best apart is accessibility.. with lot of tourists attractions to it..",5
Went here on a business trip. Service was great. The view from the 46th Floor was amazing!  Room was a bit small for a deluxe room. Strange but the walls are not as solid as cement walls. You can here sounds from other rooms even as you walk along their hallways.,4
"I should have paid more attention to another guest's comment about being ""upgraded"" while really being downgraded.  I was eager to return with my spouse and reserved the ""city view"" room, a more expensive choice.  Upon check-in (which took a lot of time), we were told we were ""upgraded"". Turns out, we were given a room at the back albeit slightly larger.  Complained and were moved eventually, but key cards failed to work about five times during our very brief 48 hour visit.  These failures necessitated long trips to the front desk and long waits in line.    Having said this, IF you go, pay more for Club access.",3
"We have been here for short stays since it opened. Have to admit that the first 2 years after opening, the hotel didn't live up to our expectations. However, this latest stay changed our impression. Check in was very fast. Room service was amazingly quick too - we got our dinner for 4 within half hour. Breakfast at Rise restaurant was a mighty feast. The buffet spread was fabulous and had quality international cuisine. The city view offered by our room at 41st floor was awesome even though we are locals and have seen this familiar scenery many times over. The infinity pool at the 57th floor was the highlight of our stay. My kids loved it so much and we had to drag them out of it. This hotel is now a 5/5 for us!",5
"Been there for 2 days short trip from jakarta.We stay at Marina Bay sand Hotel.Rooms are clean and tidy.The idea of sky pool is awsome.We played casino all night long.Games, slot machine, poker all is good.Coffe offered for free and it made us wake all night.  I would love to stay and play here again and again.",5
Nice promenade with family or solo. Window shopping or coffee break. It  offers a variety of options. Dining inside or alfresco with a view.. Enjoyable atmoshere. You can also choose to visit the annex Gardens by the Bay or the Skypark. Very nice architectural structure.,4
"The employee who checked us in, VICTOR was superb! He welcomed us with a smile and was very friendly throughout check in. I think most hotels fail to score points because their check-in agents act more like airline check-in agents...just there for the job nothing more. He accomodated the requests I made made prior to arrival via email and he even offered to connect wifi on my phone (again, he didn't have to as I can myself but he did anyway). We travel a lot and I have to say that he is so far the best check-in agent we have ever encountered. We have only been here a couple hours but I thought I should write this review before I get carried away at the infinity pool.",5
"A great one stop place in Singapore. Cosy room, amazing infinity pool on the roof, gets a little crowded with selfie clickers! We enjoyed the warm jacuzzi's near the pool better. Casino and Mall and interconnected to the Hotel, so no real need to feel the outside heat! A little overcrowded but good over all.",5
"As you know Singapore is small, it´s then not difficult to choose the hotel. I stayed in three hotels and this has the best location and wonderful views.  The room has nothing special, good, great view. But the pool is that really worth it, in fact the hotel has a unique architecture. The problem is the pool is always full, so rather go the night, which was a bit empty, but depends on the day. What tired a bit. The spa is very good.  I'm a little upset about many people who go to the bar next to the pool with very loud music, they are not staying at the hotel, just pay to go to the bar. But they take a lot of photos off the pool and off us which makes it very inconvenient for those who actually pay the hosting. Sure to put on social networks saying that stayed at the hotel, as I…",5
"We stayed at this hotel purely to use the infinity pool (which is exclusive to guests). It gets busy up there, so arrive early to ensure a sun bed.  Our room was very big and absolutely stunning, I couldn't fault a thing about it. The bed was huge and very comfy, while the bathroom was floor to ceiling marble. I think they must pump a scent around the hotel because the building smelled amazing!  Tip - ask for a room on a high floor for a better view ",5
"I spent two nights at the hotel and attention is not good, many people and little staff, I paid for a room with breakfast included and when you finish eating, I were charging what I ate , I do not understand , when you enter the restaurant you give the room number and they should check that and not make you a bad time. When I was checking out , they were charging me many soft drinks, and I had not drunk anything . after the misunderstanding , the manager told me that if I returned to the hotel, it was forbidden to touch the products of the refrigerator if not going to consume , I find it ridiculous and not at the level of a five-star hotel really, It never happened to me something and the truth if I pay what it's worth one night in this hotel should deliver excellent service. No…",2
"Enjoyed a fab Mothers' day  (uk date) drink here in March... If you go to the Skypark entrance at the 3rd Tower and say you want to visit the bar, you won't have to pay the charge just to visit.  There are seating and viewing areas to right and left, it seems to alternate depending on the time and date you visit.  I couldn't see much of the infinity pool but the views over the bay and Singapore were brilliant. The drinks weren't OTT either  I had a cocktail at $24 and my husband a Stella at 20. with of course the service and tax added.",5
"Let's face it.. The location of the hotel is perfect. You may have a view of the garden by the bay which is pretty amazing or your room may have the view of the other side which are the building and you'll have a perfect view during the light show at night. So like I said, their location is amazing.   Their staff are friendly and very efficient. Sometimes their lobby area for check in can be a little hectic but it's okay. It happens especially for in demand hotel like Marina bay sands.   Rooms are excellent. I've stay in tower 1, tower 2 and tower 3 already and all towers are great.   I don't need to elaborate how amazing their infinitely pool is. It's the BEST!   It's definitely worth it!",5
"Me and my husband stayed at Marina Bay sands for a short stay and our experience was awesome. The sky park and the infinity pool are the two icons which makes the hotel so special. Loved the breakfast and had a gigantic spread..  Would love to visit again and again but unfortunately the prices are high that we need to save a lot to go there again :-).. The feeling you get, when u get there cannot be described by words.. It's just wow and amazing... Loved the entire stay...",5
Pool is amazing and the building but rooms are not anything exciting. We found staff to be a little rude when checking in and out. Also they locked the mini fridge when deposit was used up. Thats never happened to us before and we have travelled a lot.,3
"I recommend this hotel to all guests who have a first trip to singapore. Excellent service in hotel + access to infinite pool. We spent 2 days only just in hotel, cause its very comfort place for take a rest. You will be exciting from this place. A",5
"We basically went there for the pool and for the view. My boyfriend and I stayed for one night only because due to the F1 race, it would have been too expensive to stay any longer. The staff is extremely friendly and fast. We felt very welcome even though we arrived with our backpacks and didn't look like we could afford staying there ;-)  check-in looked like it would take a while because there were quite a lot of people there, but it went faster than I expected because the staff knew exactly how to handle it. the room was what you'd expect a 5* hotel room to look like, but it wasn't particularly spectacular. we had a room on a higher storey so we had a great view of the city. the pool is definitely spectacular, we spent as much time up there as possible. it is, however, pretty…",5
"Expected to stay on high floor but receptionist assigned low floor and our rooms had no balcony. Must admit the room size is incredible and view is great but we WOULD love to have a balcony to chill at night. Bathroom is top notch, spacious and very well equipped. Pool is stunning offered best view ever. Didn't try the food but we can find good places to eat around within walking distance easily. Nice stay overall ",4
One of the best architectures ever! You may travel by bus or by train. Exit at Marina Bay station then take a certain bus number that will take you to Marina Bay Sands. You may opt to go into the dome gardens or just take a stroll around the area. Take pictures and enjoy!,4
"Stayed in Tower 3, in room 4301 for four nights and found the hotel to be great. The *01 rooms are right next to the lifts, but I didn't get disturbed. Roof top pool was great and worth doing, though they close it at 10... Had many a refreshing beveridge and only ate at the coffee shop which was over priced. Conference centre is a long walk from tower 3, but nothing most people couldn't manage.",5
"Our family of 4 (2 boys aged 17 and 14) have lived overseas for more than 11 years and has just returned to our home country Singapore. Being away from home for so long, we are almost tourist here. And so during the recent short 1 week school vacation, the family decided to have our staycation at the Marina Bay Sands - famous for its unique architecture of 3 hotel towers supporting a ""ship shaped"" sky park and infinity pool 57 stories high up in the sky.  We booked a hospitality suite which had ample space for the 4 of us to enjoy the room immensely. Although it was not on high floors, we had a beautiful balcony which oversees the super trees nearby, which was a treat. The room also entitled us to have all access into the sky park and the infinity pool. The room certainly did…",4
"I was very much looking forward to staying here.  Arriving at the hotel was disappointing. To queue over twenty minutes for check-in. Queue for the elevator. I paid for a standard room including taxes via booking.com about 400€ per night, but it's so not worth it. First of all did the room not correspond in any way to the picture of the room I booked on booking.com as that showed high ceiling rooms and mine was low ceiling. Guest services were not very helpful and even when I showed reservation, the misleading pictures from their own website and booking.com, my reservation confirmation (with room pictures) they still did not acknowledge the problem and did not solve it. and as they said, the hotel was full, so they could not be bothered. Then the next thing I noticed is that…",4
"The hotel itself is of class and also the infinity pool, service etc was as we expected it to be. But both me and my girlfriend got symptoms of food poisoning almost at the same time. This was aproximately 6 hours after the breakfast and we had not eaten anything else after the breakfast, we only drank bottled water. So this led us to believe that the only source of infection must have been either the breakfast or maybe the poolwater. ",3
"This is one unforgettable stay.  And will definitely visit again in the future.  The pool was really great as you'll see the magnificent view of the city.  Nearby attractions are also available from this 5-star hotel.  Merlion, Gardens by the bay, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, etc.  Worth every penny!!!",5
"Stayed at the end of October 2015, we arrived at like 10am, understand that it was pretty early so the room might not be ready. However, the receptionist sent us a text an hour later informing us to pick up the keys. We got a bigger corner room with garden view. The room is spacious, modern and clean. At night, I could see the super-tree light show from room. Also used the infinity swimming pool and I love it!!   Pricey but worth to visit! ",5
"What a beautiful giant men made building 💚 i would give it 10/10 , best experience ever , loved everything about it, the shopping malls under the hotel , what a view from sky pool , it's breathtaking, can't express in few lines . But in nut shell i must say if you come to Singapore & don't stay in this hotel means u didn't come here , Singapore is all about Marina Bay Sands . ",5
"The room was very spacious, with a sitting area and en suite bathroom. The in-room dining was average in flavor and quite expensive. Cleaning of the room leaves much to be desired. We stayed for over a week and on most days, the cleaning staff only came around late in the afternoon. One day the staff did not clean the room at all, despite not leaving the ""do not disturb"" sign. Once after phoning housekeeping to clean up after in-room breakfast, I returned to the room at midday and the breakfast trolley was still there.   There are too many people at all hours shuffling about in the lobby, which is unavoidable when you have a hotel connected to a casino. The front desk people were helpful, though.",3
"we stayed there for 2 days to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary. the front desk receptionist upgraded us to club room with city view. The view was just awesome, and the room was spacious. Bathroom was just awesome. It is a true 5 star hotel. They even send a cake and a personalized bday card to our room. The staff was courteous and very responsive. Infinity pool is a plus. The attached mall has all the designer shops (you name it they have it). The museum was very interesting and kept us busy for couple of hours.    The laser show was just OK, but the light show in the gardens by the bay is good to watch.",5
"One if the most beautiful hotels in the world, great architecture, amazing roof-top pool. However, do anticipate busy lobby, restaurants, roof-top pool and bars. The check-in is a real nightmare, as is the check-out. 'Disneyland queues', but now to pay for above average billing. Do not pay with another credit-card the the one you used to make your room reservations. The hotel will keep a deposit on the one and will charge payment on the other. Coming from the US or Europe and you see your card facing a two week deposit, before the money is released again, while your other card is charged directly.",2
"This Hotel has the biggest draw of any hotel.. The roof top pool. It is truely fantastic. This was a birthday treat if three days. The pool area is amazing at any time of day.. Dusk is unforgettable . The hotel it's self is very nice and rooms are large and very well prepared. But dont open the mini bar and look at the contents for as soon as you lift an item off of the tray you will be billed for it, whether you consume it or not. The breakfast is ok with many choices but is not a patch on the Traders in KL. If the pool was not up there would It be value for money.. I dont think it would but it is there so go and enjoy the experience.",5
"We stayed in this hotel during a business trip and extended the trip for private vacation. The ku-de-ta bar and the view is incredible. I'd  recomend the Mojito there was amazing. Other nice place with a top roof bar is One Altitude, from this buolding we had a really nice view on Marina Bay Sands and this building is even higher, I guess.",5
We stayed here for 2 nights on Jan 30 and 31. Check in was fast though lot of people during that time as Chinese New Year was approaching. The room is big and can fit 2 adults and 2 kids. It is near The Shoppes and close to MRT station. We'll definitely come back here.,5
"Fantastic modern hotel with the most amazing roof top pool.   I wouldn't stay again mind, as I think there are other hotels in Singapore with nicer rooms for a comparable if not cheaper price.   We stayed just for the roof top pool and the views to be honest, well worth it just for that... Although it does get quite busy up there! ",5
"For those who love, everything will always be clear. This is the fourth time that my family and I stayed with Marina Bay Sands. Our room was upgraded to the city view. Thanks Maria and Sun who had checked us in. The room was so big and the view was so amazing. Try to avoid from the peak check-in period that you will have more time to enjoy everything. We will definitely be here again!!!",5
The highlight of this hotel is the infinity pool which is built on top of the building roof... You have to be staying in the hotel if you wanna access the pool area. The experience was incredible and expensive.. It's better to book as early as possible to get a great deal,5
"While our stay at marina Bay Sands started out badly, with the double bed room we had booked months prior not being available, we were changed the second day. It was annoying and wasted time and energy, not allowing us to properly settle in after flying for almost 24 hours. However, we were able to experience rooms with both views, the first being over the bay and city, and the second view over the Gardens By The Bay and the harbour with all the boats. That was a mesmerizing view, especially when the Gardens put on a spectacular sound and light show at night. The rooms and service were terrific and we loved having a balcony in the second room. The pool and views are utterly incredible, and it is very entertaining watching everyone doing their selfies, some for hours on end!…",5
"We always wanted to stay at the iconic singapore hotel ever since we saw the pictures of the pool on the sky park.  The stay was worth the price tag just so we could swim in the pool.  The rooms were extremely nice as well.  Overall, the experience was worth the price tag......once.",5
"If you`re in Singapore you have to at least stay for one night in the marina bay sands hotel. The room is so clean and modern, you have a great gym with a lovely view over the town, The pool area on the roof top is so exiting, so uplifting view over the city and F1 race court. And what about the shopping! you have it all, and it`s right next to the hotel. A huge shopping mall where you find anything you want, almost like the Dubai shopping mall:-)",5
"Stayed a the marina bay sand one night so I could go to the pool, and experience this hotel and casino first hand. The pool was packed!!! around 7pm so decided to try again the next morning around 6 (when it opens) 6:15 packed! Chinese tourist just invaded the pool. The rooms are average, had a cheaper and better experience at the Ritz-Carlton for almost half the cost of the MBS. I just felt like another sheep being herded along, they dont make their clients feel special, and for the price you pay they should at least a bit.",2
"There was too many people in the lobby and a bit messy. Staff was kind but not that impressive. The room was not as good as its reputation. The worst thing was damp linen. It was awful. The pool was very crowded and staffs were very busy and I couldn't feel they welcomed me . Although the view at the pool was nice and new, I don't want to come again. ",3
"The check in process was quick and the staff were very helpful and professional. Once we get to our room, we're greated by our name on the TV screen. Our luggage were brought up within 2 minutes.  Great views through out the hotel, from our balcony as well as from the sky deck. Will definitely stay here again in the future.",5
"We got a room on the 50th floor and the view was incredible, overlooking Gardens by the Bay. The pool is also amazing, particularly at night, with panoramic views of the city.  The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. We ordered from the large room service menu and the food was incredible.",5
"Check in was very busy when I arrived and it seemed quite a laborious process. It is such a large hotel it does seem a bit like a railway station.  Thait siad once you have got your bearings, it is a very nice place to grab a bite to eat and watch the world go by.  The room was well appointed with a lovely comfortable bed and pillows.  The bathroom was very nice with lots of room and a lovely bath and separate shower.   My room overlooked the gardens which had a fabulous light show each night.  Room service food was excellent and not overpriced.  Many people stay here for the infinity pool 57 floors up.  It really is stunning ( if a bit windy!) and the whole place has a holiday vibe!",4
"Marina Sands failed to live up to expectations. We stayed in Tower 3 - it was like coming in the back door; you had no one greeting you or pointing you in the right direction, no signs, no help with bags or doors - it was like arriving at a bus or train station. Inside was no better. When we did find the check in area you had to queue. Found the staff to be pretty cold, the place lacked soul and taste - the lasting impression was all they were after was your money.  The pool area was filled with people and the noise of voices was the dominating feature. You were constantly asked if you wanted drinks or something off the menu - even down to a supervisor coming to check if I had been asked if I wanted something. You can get Wifi but if you want speed then you have to pay for it.…",2
"Great experience. A bit pricey, but worth it! We're upgraded to a city view room in upper level and it was so amazing. We ended up waking early in the morning, 5am then headed to the swimming pool on top. By that time, fog covering the city, some lights were still on which added the spark in the view. Really good experience.",5
"Delox room is lux and relaxing, Furnitur quality is good, Desk is next to window when you sending email and thinking you have good veiw of city Carpet quality is good and clean Interior design is acceptable for this size room Other Amenities is good",5
"The main reason we booked the hotel was for the infinity pool and to be able to say w have been. Check in was really busy but there was a number of staff assisting so the the wait wasn't as long as it could have been. We booked the a city view primier room. For Asia the room was really spacious and had a great bathroom. And the veiw was amazing! definitely worth paying a bit more.  The Infinity pool is what you would see in many photos and it has an great view of the city. Highly recommend going up there at night. Early morning they also turn one of the sections to a lap pool if you would like to have a morning swim. Nothing beats doing laps 57 floors up! There are no real downsides to the experience, but if i have to be picky then one will b you have to go outside in order to…",5
"A good break without travelling out of the country.  For tourist, it is a must as the experience even for 1 nite is good.   Room is good... stayed in tower 1. All 3 towers are good.  Stayed before in tower 1 and 3.  This current stay are in Paiza rooms. Nice, with bathtub.  Views are topnotch whichever side you are facing.. city view or garden view, Infinity pool is a must go to .... looking out at the skyline of Singapore city be it day or nite definitely a must. Rooms are well appointed so .. no complain here...  note: no newspaper.. at door but a call ... you will get it.. ice bucket too.extra pillows...etc Service top notch.  Food.. unfortunately, everything is ex here... Sigh.. well.. pay while on holiday.  foodcourt also 50% more ex than food court anyway around Singapore.…",4
"The room is great, it's spacious. Nice  bed and very comfy pillow. Very nice view of the city at night or even at the day so I recommend you guys to request for the room in higher floor. But the highlights of this hotel is the infinity pool. It's at 57th floor. Only the hotel guest can access the pool. Drinks are allowed in the pool which is very great. Sunset view is awesome.  ",4
"This is a fabulous hotel in a great location with amazing facilities and transport links. We splashed out on a cub room as it was a special occasion and when it said the room came with a free breakfast I was expecting something very light but in fact it was an absolute feast which more than set you up for the day. In addition the room itself was amazing. It was large, comfortable, had every amenity you could imagine and was so lovely and quiet.  The pool of course is one of the main draws. We used it twice and there was always plenty of space. Using it early in the morning is good as the sun hasn't quite hit it so it's lovely and cool :) The MRT is just downstairs and it's a good line which will take you all the way into the main centre or to other lines plus it's easy to use -…",5
"So I have finally stayed at Marina Bay Sands. Now let's review:   Booking process  First, let's comment on the booking process. I rang up the reservations hotline on the night of 29 Feb to book the Stay & Valet package (that comes with free valet credits). The reservations person said I should book online as I can make payment via credit card to secure the booking immediately since this is a non-refundable booking. So the next morning, I went online to make the booking only to find that the package wasn't there no more. I rang and enquired and was told it was only valid till 29 Feb. Why didn't the guy last night tell me that??!?!! I ended up booking the normal club room package.   Room Comfort and Amenities The city view club room was clean, big and spacious with an awesome view…",3
"This is a pretty impressive piece of architecture! My wife & i stayed here in February as the first leg of our 30th wedding anniversary celebration holiday. The last time we stayed in Singapore this hotel didn't exist! This hotel is a beast of a place with about 2,500 rooms, a shopping mall attached, umpteen restaurants in the hotel and attached mall and the rooftop pool is a feat of engineering!  I had a rocky start here with regards to booking wine in my room for arrival, but I have to mention Wangelin Sum who I then dealt with as she sorted everything out and in the end we arrived to a bottle of complimentary wine, a beautiful bouquet of flowers and an anniversary cake, so in the end it was a great start to our holiday.  We chose a garden view club room which was impressive…",4
"Well worth a visit  while queues can be long and a bit of a battle for the lifts,the view of Singapore at night is spectacular,nice cooling breeze. Down side if eating in restaurant you may get trapped in the lift with sightseers, and view is obscured by number of people on deck, while eating.",5
"LOVED this place. From the moment I stepped in the door we were treated like royalty. We had priority check in, room up grade. The service was fantastic. The room was superb and the restaurants were great. I would recommend for anyone to go here. You will not regret it!",5
"We had a 3D2N staycation. Though we were allocated the lower floors, 8th floor, i have no complaints! The view of the Garden by the Bay was spectacular. Room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. Security was tight as only guests with key card could access the hotels. The infinity pool is one of the must visit place. Even if its just to take pictures! Great great view of the city, port and the skyline of Singapore. Service was great as i had problem with the TV, but operator managed to solve my problem patiently. I loved the fitness club, which offered a great view at 55 floor. Though i found it a tad small for such a big hotel,well, i reckon not all guests who stay will visit the gym.  The service was fantastic as being a local, sometimes we may be treated differently from…",5
We had a 1 night stay with my 3 kids at The Grand Club Room. It was my 3rd child 1st bday so some of our close friends came to visit us. The room is just so big to accomodate our visitors.  The view was nice and relaxing (garden view).  The only thing that bothered us was the coolness of the aircon. The room was warm despite of the adjustment of the temp.  But overall had a great stay. We enjoyed every bit of it.  Here's our breakfast pic at Club 55.,5
"the best about this place are the infinite pool. Rooms are big but the furniture are very simple. nothing special,Pool was very busy all the time and water was warm. Service was nice and friendly but they are very strict with the schedule.",4
"After staying in The Ritz-Carlton Tokyo for a couple of nights before flying into Singapore, I wasn't expecting to be blown away but wow is it impressive.   From driving on the freeway from the EXPO area and coming over the bridge to see this epic cruise-liner resting on the top of the three towers to actually stepping into this massive hotel lobby filled with diversity from every corner of the world, and of course, very updated rooms including remote controlled lights, beautiful views and very fresh carpets. The entire experience was amazing.   It's extremely conveniently located, although if you're not looking to buy Prada or Armani then the shopping center attached through the casino level may not be for you which it's still not a big deal considering the COUNTLESS shopping…",5
"I would give it five stars in almost every attribute. Smooth, easy and early check in without any fuss. Spacious rooms, luxurious amenities, very helpful staff, amazing food and of course the AWESOME POOl. Had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back....",5
"We were greeted at the front of the hotel by a porter who got our bags out of the taxi and loaded them onto a trolley and delivered them to our room. Great Service!  Went to checkin at 2.30pm (meant to be 3pm), waited in line 5 minutes. Greeted by a very friendly girl on the counter. We have upgraded your room for you, if its not how you would like it please let us know she said. Meaning the bedding arrangements. Your room is ready for you. Excellent Service!  Got to the room on the 42nd floor tower 2! AMAZING!!!! We were given a Club Room! The view of the city and room were nothing short of spectacular. Had a large king size bed, sofa bed, large bath which we used, huge shower and bathroom.  Everything 3 girls could ever dream of! Bed and Pillows were super comfortable. The…",5
"While the SkyPark is quite the tourist attraction, with amazing views of the city, the only way to reach the Infinity Pool is to actually be a guest at the hotel.  This has been on my husband's ""bucket list"" since he first saw photos on the internet, so we had to stay there on our first visit to the city.  Our flight arrived around noon and we headed to the Marina Bay Sands, despite the fact that check-in wasn't until 3 pm.  Nevertheless, the people at the Sands treated us (and everyone around us) like royalty.  As the line was long at check-in, despite the early arrival, a supervisor from the VIP office came out and escorted 3 groups into the VIP check-in area, where we were rapidly checked in and went to our room on the 49th floor.  We showered from our flight, then headed to…",5
"We stayed two nights in this spectacular hotel. Everything from checkin to checkout was smooth and excellent. The room was great with an excellent view of the city. The breakfast buffet was nearly impossible to drag yourself away from. The service was excellent throughout. The rooftop pool obviously is everything you would expect it to be. A few too many people but you can't have it all. Simply amazing. The bars you have access to, the proximity to transport, airport, restaurants, shops. Just superb. ",5
"Great hotel and we have a club room.   Check in was super quick and smooth.   So far everything has been very impressive.  Will check the club lounge tomorrow, but I can't see what people have to complain about.",5
"Yes, it is a huge casino hotel and one should expect to line up from time to time but this hotel isn't for me. I've stayed here before and wasn't too bothered about it but I will make it a point not to stay in this hotel even if I am attending an exhibition in MBS.   It is a very busy hotel so one should not expect much privacy or any peace and quiet except if you are in your room, which is large and well appointed.   So the queues.. there is a line to check in, a line for the breakfast buffet, a line for the elevators, there is a line for almost anything although automated express check out was quick and hassle free.   The pool is spectacular but way too crowded.   The hotel is part of a casino, mall and exhibition complex so there is plenty to do and see but Singapore is so…",3
"This hotel has a great pool on the roof, good quality rooms, and is conveniently located by the Gardens by the Bay.  There is a rather large, somewhat expensive/luxurious mall easily accessed from the hotel.  There are lots of restaurants in the mall, but at an additional 10-15min walk from the lobby.  The hotel restaurants are good enough, and not particularly over priced for a hotel, but the waits are very long.  Just not enough restaurant capacity for such a large hotel.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The only downside was the obnoxiously loud family next door yelling and blasting TV late a night during Chinese New Year.  But overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again.",4
"We went to Singapore just to enjoy Marina Bay Sands Hotel and visit Universal Studios.  Husband, son and myself truly enjoyed.  We got the room that comes with Club 55 access.   Only downside you get only to stay at Club 55 till 7pm.  Unlike other hotels, it’s 24 hours accessible.  Well, pricey but very well worth it.  We got the room at the 49th room with the a view of Garden’s by the Bay.  View was just spectacular.  It was very beautiful/colorful during the day and very serene/calm during the night.    Check in was fast, considering we went there past noon time. And one good thing, our room was ready!  Rooms are well appointed.  Bathroom clean and quite spacious.  My little boy enjoyed the tub more than anything else.    We got a room near the elevators!  Boy the elevators…",4
"The top is fantastic !! What a view !! Awesome pool areas!! But far to crowded!! The bars are fantastic and very expensive, but we knew before we came 😉. Our room at 29. Floor with city view was so nice !! I agree with some other in here ; everywhere is like a big shopping mall!! Still it's a great experience. Food is good everywhere in the hotel we think 😊. We stayed here for two nights. That's enough 😉. Fantastic architecture and surrounding areas.",4
We have long wished to visit Marina Bay Sands and take a dip at their famous infinity pool...when we finally did the experience was simply spectacular. Breath-taking views over the city and the gardens. Charming and polite staff. Nicely-fitted rooms. The lobby was a bit crowded though during check ins. Overall we would love to go back given the chance!,5
Truly fabulous . Excellent property .completely lives up to its hype . Huge property with good sized rooms . Casino ( lucky one too ). Lotta celebrity dining options . The Best feature of the hotel has to be the roof top infinity pool . The kids loved it . A good family vacation even if u have to stay in . ,5
A hotel with an iconic image especially when viewing from afar. Visit the C'est La Vie bar and restaurant at the very top giving a panoramic vista of the marina and all the skyscrapers beyond. You have to be a resident to get right to the edge for an unhampered view or use the infinity pool but a visit is a must do.,4
"We chose Marina Bay Sands for the same reason as everyone else - the pool, and it did not disappoint. Brilliant for early morning swimming as the sun comes up, still spectacular but busy in the afternoon. The rest of the hotel was fine, the room was more than satisfactory and the MRT was conveniently located in the basement. Beautiful views over the gardens. We did struggle however to find check in and a lot of the time we felt like we were staying in a serviced apartment attached to a shopping mall. We didn't feel like paying for breakfast but we wouldn't have known where to find it even if was included in the rate. We would recommend staying here to anyone that hasn't been but if we were to return to Singapore we would look at other options with a more personal touch.",4
"For such a huge hotel, the lobby is as busy as a public street in a major city, however once I was ensconced in my room, the hotel felt small and boutique like .... not an easy feat when you see the scale of the hotel.  Flawless service.",5
"Must stay at least once. This isn't my first stay, possibly my 3rd or 4th, lost count. On my first stay, there were tiny cockroaches in the room. 3 of them. They upgraded us to the suite. But that was years ago (in 2010) when they first opened. Years later no such problems anymore. Good thing they improved. Sky bars are open for visitors, no need to pay or reserve. Nevertheless, this will still be my chosen hotel for Singapore if I have the extra cash for the luxurious comfort.",5
"the reason we stay in Marina Bay sands last time because we are attending my cousin wedding. the breakfast was superb. although the dining place, it's not a friendly location for disable person because we need to climb few stairs to enter their amazing coffee house. the decoration of the hotel was amazing. will visit again! definitely!. BUT their room price was was was so damn expensive. ;-( anyway. good place. amazing view. gain new experience. so! why not ya! pay and enjoy! ",5
"This hotel had been on my ""Places to stay list"" and I was certainly glad I made the decision as its now on my ""Places to return to list"". The hotel is very unique.  It's huge but still personal.  We booked a Club room and the view that comes with that is just a joy.  To look out on the harbour day and night was simply stunning and the fireworks were an added bonus. We had breakfast and canopies each evening of our stay and Club 55 became the hub of our holiday.  The staff were attentive and remembered us and made you feel very welcome.  The canopies they served each evening were fine dining standard and just delightful.   The infinity pool if simply stunning.  Even when it is busy there are lots of beds and the view and photo opportunity is something you will ever forget. I will…",5
View spectacular. Good music. Service excellent. Great place to chill and enjoy the view of Singapore. If you are not staying at the hotel . Another way to enjoy the view is to have a few drinks at the skybar. Expensive but worth it.,4
"Good or bad reviews this hotel takes your breath away.  We stayed for one night and wish we had longer, yes its expensive but what you get in return is worth it.  The hotel structure is just mind blowing, a casino, full shopping centre and the pool tops it off.  Didn't bother with the restaurant breakfast, have it by the pool, half the cost and you get that view.  The best is at dusk, stay in the pool until it goes dark and you get the best pictures.  The pool is for hotel guests only, its a shame we couldn't use it after check out until we departed for the airport but I suppose they are the rules.  Very expensive but it is lovely!  Alex Yates",5
"I've stayed this hotel 3 times. I prefer the garden view room better than city view room since you can enjoy the city view from the rooftop pool(infinite pool). you do not have to put additional money to get the city room view. The room condition is great, so clean and modern.  I love to see the night view of Singapore from the rooftop pool.. although sometimes I see some kids pee in the swimming pool.. and the security didn't stop them.. or he couldn't see it..? oh and the two jacussi located in the garden view side were nice to try as well.  We loved Gym so much. running on the treadmills with the whole night view was quite incredible.",4
"Very nice view from the top floor, amazing pool and very nice atmosphere. Enjoy breakfast near the most amazing pool, but it better to come earlier as many people want to do this at the same time;) however the hotel is rather noisy and never sleeps and maybe you can be tired of lots of people around you. Also You should spend 20 minutes in big Q. for check in and check out.",4
"We had been dreaming about staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore for many years but never could justify the expense. However, for a special big 50th birthday, we decided to blow the budget, and tick off one of the things on our bucket list.  Transfer from Changi Singapore Airport - Marina Bay Sands Hotel will provide a Limousine transfer, however, the cheapest rate at this time $120 (£60). Tip – Get a normal taxi from the airport, this is very easy to do. We followed the Taxi signs just outside the arrivals hall and found it easily, we jumped in a taxi, paid $24 (£12) and arrived at the hotel 20 minutes later. Checking in - We had booked a Grand Club Room so were able to check in at the Club desk. This was situated in Tower one and easy to find. The service was…",5
"Located at Marina Bay, you could access the hotel and nearby sites by MRT (Bayfront Station)  High en shops, restaurants from local to international, world-class casino, luxe hotel. Name it, MBS has almost all the classy travellers/shoppers (not me :-) ) ever wanted.",4
"I must say that if u go Singapore than without visiting marina bay sands your trip is incomplete. It is such a lovely property for all aspects shopping, hospitality, food even Indian food is amazing , rooms are very spacious, casino is there n last but not d least THE INFINITY POOL. Aahhhh it is just a big WOWWWW! One can see whole Singapore from there. As I was with my baby they provided baby cot n baby amenity kit which was of excellent quality of pigeon brand. And location of the property is also amazing. Even it has the most beautiful gardens by the bay. Worth going I must say.",5
"Pool was amazing as all the pictures show, but there were some let downs. The non-smoking room smelled of smoke so we had to change rooms, and most of the food was overprice for the quality of food. The restaurant Ku De Ta was pricey for the mediocre quality of food - have had much better in other cities.  Although there were some great ups to the trip - very good location to the shopping area and Marina Singapore.  Service was sometimes slow and especially ordering things (ie. pillows/sheets) to the room took over an hour, but I guess you would expect that from such a large hotel.",4
"Very nice hotel, but honestly quite business-like so did not set me to a vacation mood immediately.   What made our stay was our decision to book a club room with complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks. View from the club is amazing, service excellent.   Infinity pool is worth a visit and taking those Instagram photos.",4
"Visited here with my friend  it was a great experience place overlooking the city of singapore ,very nice infinity pool ,have to go early to reserve  so you can join the group tour wish to coming back again ",5
"I'd always wanted to stay here and was so glad that we did. The hotel is mind blowing - huge structure made of 3 towers. As expected, it was very busy and we did feel this took the edge off it a bit. Convenient location and there's an MRT stop below the hotel. This really is a resort destination with a casino, theatre, many restaurants, gardens and even a shopping mall attached to it. We loved exploring and wished we could have stayed for longer!  We took a club room which was a good size with a city view. The only comment about the room would be the quality of the towels which was quite poor considering the price of the room. The rest of the linens and finish to the room was great.  Our club room gave us access to the club lounge on the 55th floor where they serve breakfast and…",4
This is a hotel with the wow factor from th first time you see it till you enter and see the size of the place it is a destination in its own right. Even if you don't stay here it is worth a visit. We arrived and had no issues in booking in with an efficient reception team. Our bags were taken to our room in Tower 3. The hotel is 57 floors high our room was on the 13th on entering we still had a great view out over the Gardens by the Bay to the ocean. The room itself was modern clean and had all the facilities required fridge safe etc. Bathroom good size with a shower over the bath but no issues. We had no problems with the Wi Fi in the room or public areas. As a guest Yo have access to the roof top pool on the Sky deck.  This is a must visit it truly is spectacular with…,5
"Infinity swimming pool on level 57 is just breath taking.. as soon as you get in the pool and look over the edge you will forget everything else..  Apart from swimming pool, bar on lvl 57 and view from your room there is nothing special about this hotel. All other things are over priced. Gardens by the bay and The Shoppes mall is nearby. Mall again is expensive. Food court in The Shoppes is around 10-15 min walk from hotel to buy food/coffee at above decent price. You can't stay there if you want to enjoy real singapore food, streets, culture and people.  Hotel entrance lobby of all three towers is full of tourist during day time who are there to just see the building. This certainly gives you feeling of residing at a public/tourist spot instead of 5 star abode.  Worth paying…",3
"We stayed here just one night in a 12 day trip to surrounding countries. The vista was worth the pricey rooms. The pool attendants provided fabulous customer service. Front desk experience included long lines, friendly, but not informative on hotel layout. This would have been helpful as the property is gigantic. We had the breakfast buffet, also pricey but an amazing selection of authentic and diverse cuisines from local to comfort foods and everything in between. The rooms were very clean and modern with appropriate amenities. All public restrooms were maintained impeccably. The bell staff did not speak English and was therefore not helpful anytime we left. The concierge tried to be helpful, but language again was a bit of an issue. The location was not within walking distance…",5
"This hotel is simply overrated! If you're going to commute, the location is quite a long walk from the nearest mrt. Sure you can get a cab, but pricey! The room we booked might have just been deluxe, but it was really small, and stank of cigarettes! We specifically requested a non-smoking room but was greeted by the smell once we opened the door. We called reception to ask for another room but we were told they were fully booked and just said that they will send room service. We wasted several hours of our precious holiday in the room, waiting for the staff that never came! The staff came when we came back to the hotel, armed with a can of air freshener which didn't do any good of course! With the amount we paid for this hotel, I was very disappointed! It was too crowded,…",1
"The scale of this hotel is jaw-dropping. It can be a little busy at times in the lobby which is slightly off putting but the eating spaces, especially the bar on the roof, are relaxing and tranquil.  The views from the Sky Deck are just breathtaking, as is the infinity pool. This place is a must see if you're visiting Singapore.",4
Stayed 2-nights in a King-Bed City View Premier Room. Was sort of a birthday staycation with the wife over 2 weekdays.   Pros : (1) Rooms were clean.  Most basic requirement and the rooms were kept clean throughout the stay. Refer to photos of the room attached.  (2) Pool was Memorable. Guess one of the biggest reason to stay here and take in the epic view of the Singapore skyline from the pool is a must ! A swim is a must.   (3) The Great View of the Skyline from the Room Again the view of the city from the room was breath taking. Gives you an appreciation of the very varied Singapore Skyline  (4) Staff Service was good This does seem to get very varied reviews. During my stay the service standard of the staff I interacted with was great. We had dinner with the parents one of…,4
One of a kind experience...wish we could go back en savor another extraordinary moment in this precious location 🏙... My kids really had fun staying in our room and even more when we jumped in to the infinity pool on top of the 3 towers. It was breathtaking! Such an architectural en engineering wonder.  ,5
"This hotel is in my view, to big, with to many people. It has 2561 rooms, which are very nice, with good views. However! When you enter the hotel, the volume of people, is just mind blowing. You think it ll quieten down, but it doesn't. There s no peace at all, apart from in your room, the ground floors just like a transit airport, where you are continuously bumping into rude people, to interested in there mobile phones. Facilities are poor on the ground floor, limited toilets, seating away from the bar/restaurants. Staff are nice and fairly efficient, although, a week after we left, there still taking money off our credit card. I ve tried to email them, on this matter, but there mailbox is continuously full, so it won't deliver. The 57 floor pool is great, but it's very…",1
"I had read lots of reviews before staying here for 3 nights and asked myself if it was worth the extra. It really is - the views, pool, service and location are brilliant. There's a fancy shopping mall under the hotel and casino too but the best thing was the tube stop. As it rains a lot of the time in Singapore this made getting around really easy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5
"The Marina Bay Sands is a stunning hotel as you approach with a rooftop pool complex extending across three towers at the 57th floor of each.  Incredible infinity pool and pleasant bars and restaurants on top.  To me, this is the highlight of the hotel.  Overall property is very nice and well located.  If you enjoy walking or running, great access to marina area, gardens and related paths.  Connected to large high-end shopping and casino if this is your thing.  Only down-side is that it is quite expensive (and so have rated it as very good vs. excellent for price/value consideration) and if for more budget conscious there are other great properties in Singapore.   If cost is not an issue then highly recommended especially if you may have time to enjoy the rooftop amenities.",4
"A holiday at this hotel was on my bucket list; I couldn't wait to stay there. The design is amazing and I couldn't wait to laze by the incredible infinity pool. We stayed for four nights in December as a family of four. Two nights would have been plenty. My best description of the hotel and our experience, was that it felt like we stayed for four nights in a shopping mall.  Beside the pool level, which is always extremely busy and the Club lounge, there really isn't really anywhere that seems exclusive to guests. You're constantly fighting for space and attention with outside visitors. The hotel sits above a high-end shopping mall which was really very impressive and had great stores and a wonderful selection of restaurants. However, as they are all inside the shopping mall, you…",4
"Stayed at MBS recently attending a conference in Singapore. The front desk team were extremely friendly and accomodating. My room was very comfortable with all the ammenities required. I was facing out to Gardens by the Bay which to me was till a beautiful view. The view on the city side is just gorgeous. The view from the roof top bar is as good a view as you will find anywhere in the world. Expect to spend HUGE dollars on alcohol, however this is not unique when you're in Singapore. The pool is just stunning but crowded. All in all the experience at MBS was pleasurable. Great location, great shops, albeit high end and expensive. Would stay there again.",4
"It is, like you see it in the pictures! The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We stayed on the 31st floor tower 2 overlooking the bay and it was amazing. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff were very attentive & helpful. I was worried about the check in process as it can take long at such big hotels but I was pleasantly surprised it didn't last more than 10 minutes. The infinity pool was the best part. Do yourself a favor and visit this hotel!! ",5
"Fantastic location - train and bus station right there which makes getting around the city a breeze. Wonderful service! We arrived at 8am and were offered an early check in, which was so gratefully accepted.   Had breakfast at Spago - again extremely wonderful service, can't fault it. Good selection at the buffet.   Pool area has the best view of the city and bay - but very busy at times. Head up early in the morning for peace and quiet.   Drinks expensive compared to elsewhere. But you expect that with the view and service.   Prices at various restaurants can be heart stopping - be prepared! ",4
"Granted, this place looks awesome from a distance. Who ever though of creating a rooftop park across three skyscrapers? Awesome.  However, if you are just passing through, and want to enjoy a few hours of relaxation, don't bother going there. First of all, nowhere is it indicated what tower actually provides 'guest' access to the rooftop. This means I actually traveled to the 57th floor twice before finding out that there was only one venue open to non-guests.  Then upon entering the rooftop (great view), all I thought of was: Disneyland. Loads of people, very busy, security checks everywhere and increasingly high prices. There are so many great places in Singapore, this one ain't one of them. If you really really really want to go to the 57th floor, take tower 2, then exit and…",3
I highly recommend marina bay sands. All the facilities are 1 minute away. The view is unbelievable. Casino was a real highlight for me. Pool area was extremely busy with a lot people. Maybe just one thing that out me off a little so many people cramp in such a small space.,5
"The hotel is conveniently located on the green subway line, so traveling was convenient to all parts of the city, as well as to and from the airport. It's also a great location for people who like to run outdoors. My room was facing the gardens and the private balcony was something I really enjoyed. Check in was fast and the service was great. I received everything I asked for and staff are very kind and courteous. I would definitely recommend the hotel.",5
"We stayed there only one night but it was the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in! We upgraded our room at arrival, which was on the 47th floor with a breathtaking view on the city. The rrom was very spacious and elegant. The receptionists were extremely friendly. They guided us to the VIP check-in lounge when checking in because there was a small queue. The gym is very well equiped with a great view and very aimable changing room with sauna, steambath and hot water. The infinity swimming pool on the 57th floor is amazing and is legendary, especially at night when the lights of the city and the skyscrapers opposite are turned on! Unfortunately the food at the pool is very poor. We ordered 3 hamburgers which were very poor and a ceasar salad which we didn't even eat, so…",5
"Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel when is comes to its architecture, location, restaurant options and the roof pool (the best thing about the hotel), but for a guest at the hotel, hospitality matters too. The food is excellent with a lot of vegetarian options and options to select various restaurants. Do visit the roof top restaurant. The infinity pool is where you can easily spend 2-3 hours with jacuzzi and sauna also available  On our arrival at 8:30am, we requested for an early check-in, given that the hotel has a policy of checking in at 3pm. Though the rooms were vacant, the hotel staff was reluctant in allocating rooms to most of the arriving guests. We had to remind them 5-6 times after which finally they gave us a room (they had to select a room to allot out of the many…",3
"Large, clean and nice decorated rooms. Very comfortable beds with great views of the bay.  I think the photos of the root top speak for its self, wouldn't hesitate in staying here again. staff all friendly and very helpful.",5
"Marina Bay Sands houses a mall, a museum, two large theaters, seven ""celebrity chef"" restaurants, two floating Crystal Pavilions, a skating rink, and the casino. The Singapore Merlion and the Singapore flyer are also around the same place.  Every evening we have the light and sound show which has combination of music with Laser lights, smoke, fire and water fountains.",4
"Booked a birthday weekend staycation with my family, at the Family Room (paid $1800 for 2 nights). It's not our first time staying at MBS, due to its proximity to the casino and shopping. However, on the first afternoon a terrible incident happened which made us swear not to stay at MBS again - when the 3 ladies were in the room alone without dad, the 2 sisters and mum were showering / using the toilet in the 2 bathrooms (with the bathroom doors ajar), a room service guy personnel just let himself into the room to place newspapers we have asked for earlier in the day right in the middle of the room's coffee table (not even just dropping it at the door), when it was obvious there are people showering and talking in the bathrooms. When we fed this back to the manager, the response…",1
"We were invited to stay there for 2 nights and were quite excited! We did not except the boutique hotel experience, as clearly, a big hotel like this cant offer that.  Check-in was rather quick and we were given a room in the 40th floor, which had an amazing view over the Gardens Bay the Bay and the sea. The room was spacious, the interior design pretty standard (I guess I had just expected something to stand out a bit more...). The smoke detector was beeping (empty battery) by the time we checked-in and we had to get housekeeping right away, not a big deal, but wondering whether the cleaners did not notice this prior?  What we enjoyed most was the breakfast on the 57th floor, it was delicious, with heaps of choices and amazing food.  The biggest disappointment was the pool. It…",3
"Singapore is a great city to stay wherever you choose but to be in the Marina Bay Sands you can look out over the entire city from your clean spacious and well equipped room, before exploring the city. Staying at the hotel means you can pose and splash in he 57th floor infinity pool which is a world class experience, and thee are loads of restaurants to choose from some of which are truly excellent",5
"Loved the set up of MBS. Really nice. Loved the gardens around the property as well. Very central to most everything in downtown Singapore. Easy access. Very senic, great photo opportunities all around the property and the marina.",5
"Have stayed at the hotel twice, this time in Jan 16.  Its a property to experience but just for a night if you are paying from your pocket. Any number of days is good if it's business travel and will elaborate why. - The location is great with some great views from the high floor rooms - The infinity pool is a must dip  However, - service is not up to the mark except for at the front desk - the food is anything to write home about (am a zero maintenance foodie)",4
"The Marina Bay Sands is one of the most awe inspiring buildings in Singapore and sparkles like gold at night. You can't miss the ship shaped top of the building which offers a birds' eye view of the glittering city. The hotel has a mall inside which is huge and housing the world's ultra luxurious brands. The water and light show is free every evening outside the mall on the river side. Overall, it is a pleasurable sight and should not be missed.",4
"Stayed for a week, will never come back. If you want to share your holiday with 5000 other people constantly taking selfies stay here. Yes the view from the top is great but it's so crowded it feels like you're holidaying in a shopping mall. ",2
"If you like big Vegas style hotels than this might be the place for you. I don't and really didn't like this place. It huge, full of tourists, has no real lobby but rather a gigantic mall type space, and is not set up for business travellers. Two simple requests proved to be difficult. On the plus, the room was perfectly nice with a great view, and the pool is something else.",3
"Very large hotel which I feel has no soul about it, I believe it's now around 5 yrs old and it is starting to look tired. The soft furnishings in the bars and restaurants are stained , chipped and scratched. The check in service is very poor, you are herded into a roped off line, where you can stand for 10 minutes +. The view from the pool is fantastic although trying to secure a lounge is nearly impossible as the towels are not cleared from them by those leaving or the pool staff- getting food or drink is even harder up there. I would recommend anyone staying here to seriously consider paying the extra for the club privileges- which includes drinks from 5-7pm. At Sin. $490+ 17% per night for a club room, I think there are better hotels offering value and service in Singapore ",3
"We would normally think twice about paying this for a hotel room, but MBS is simply one of the hotels in the world you need to visit It is well known, often frequented by celebrities , offers unparalleled views across Singapore.  The sky pool on the 57th floor is legendary & has to be visited The downside to MBS is that it is simply very busy - we were in low season but check in was lengthy albeit they let us have the room for noon which was great. The pool soon becomes hectic & sunbeds fill quickly. Staff are great & helpful if they see you struggling We had a room overlooking the city which was fantastic. Rooms are large & overall well appointed, albeit plug sockets are not well placed (says my wife as not suitable for hair preparation).  Rise breakfast was superb but again…",5
"2nd time visitior, booked a room with balcony facing the gardens. Got the worst possible location on the far side of tower 1 on floor 8. I asked for a room with a nice view and this was the best they could do, haha! Overall wasn't pleased by room choice, people in my group who booked lesser rooms got much better location and preferences than I did.   Room was clean, but some stuff needed repairs. Phone cord broken so no phone, couldn't call for a replacement or any assistance.  Overall its still a nice property, would stay if I come back.",4
"Wow totally amazed by the Swimming pool view, staff was very friendly which help me on upgrading to my desire view requested by my Girlfriend. Have really a really great experience with this hotel. Will definitely be back for the future with my family member.",5
"The Marina Bay Sands stands out because of its sheer presence. It has great architecture, a good location and is well-run and efficient. However, due to the massive crowds at the hotel itself and the nearby shopping centre and attractions, it has an impersonal ambiance. There is a general ""Las Vegas"" type feel to the whole area.   We stayed in a Grand Club Room, which was extremely comfortable and well set-up for a family with 3 young kids. The Club 55 Lounge has great views, excellent food and gets you away from the crowds. As other travelers have stated in their reviews, the pool is spectacular and a stay here is almost worth it for that alone. However, it is always full of guests/visitors and the only time get the full ""pool experience"" and accompanying view is to go there at…",4
"Stayed for one night pre cruise, on arrival we were taken to vip check in and was upgraded to a city view on 49th floor,  room was lovely and spectacular views can even watch the laser show. The pool area is fantastic but was very busy late afternoon never seen so many selfie sticks in my life. Gave that a miss and went to bar great service but very expensive $27 a pint nice views. Went back to pool 1st thing in morning had pool to our self well actually myself due to fact it was absolutely freezing so wife just paddled. I'm sure it must warm up later in day.considering the rate we paid you would of thought breakfast would be included not another $50 a person extra. We again gave that a miss and went else where. The hotel has some spectacular features but because of its immense…",5
"We spent three days at the Hotel. The room is spacious overlooking a magnificent view of the lack and the famous Art Science Museum, the Esplanade Mall, Merlion Park, the shops at marina bay sands, theater, sands expo and convention center. The room has a specious bathroom with a bath top and a separate shower area. The bed is very comfortable with silky white sheets.   The Hotel has one of the most famous swimming pools in the world located at the 57th floor, that has many celebrity Chef restaurants. The pool area is a place you will not get enough of, the spectacular view is something to really remember and talk about, the pool gives you the illusion that you are at the edge of the building.  Staying at the Hotel you will have enough activities that will consume your time…",5
"The pool is spectacular and as it's for guests only it is worth the stay for that alone, but personally I found the hotel too large and impersonal, the area was a fair distance from all the sights (apart from Gardens by the Bay) and only good for very expensive shopping. I'm glad I stayed but was disappointed overall. The Club55 lounge was a nice perk there and the staff there very friendly and attentive unlike many of the other staff. The free evening drinks and canapes were good and busy. For the best time (and unspoilt pictures) from the pool you need to go at 0600 when it opens or stay to 2300 when it closes. Otherwise it's completely full of people taking selfies.",4
"We have selected to celebrate our wedding anniversary at this hotel. We booked for Premium City View room at MBS. We have also booked for a limousine for pick up from airport. The limousine was Benz S class (Not the top end available in its class, hence no massage options etc..). We were well greeted from the airport and the transfer was also nice. The check in was too good and very fast. We were given Premium City View room on 42nd Floor. The view from this floor was amazing!! The Infinite Swimming pool at the top floor(57th floor) is really a top attraction and also a great experience. The pool facility is available only for hotel guests only(Which is good move, otherwise the pool would have been too crowded). Sky 57 restaurant at top floor has also an amazing view for dining…",5
"We stayed in an Orcid suite for three nights. The view from the suite was spectacular, the staff in the hotel and also in the lounge was fantastic, and ofcourse the infinity pool are very nice. We really enjoyed our stay!",5
"It is massive and has everything that you would want in your hotel....  but when i reached the hotel (not as a guest but as a tourist), i found out that the hotel is just tooooo crowded....the terrace on the 57th floor has a beautiful view but again just too many people....  the hotel also has a shopping center and also a casino...  outside the hotel there a many restarzunts and a lake with boating and all....also there is a nice lazer and projection show...  so all in all a great experience....surrounded by the garden and S'pore eye...",4
"The rooms was wonderful with a big wow when they look over  marina bay view. Absolutely brilliant experience in every respect. My stay was thoroughly enjoyable and the staff is extremely helpful .The room reflects perfect balance of luxury and comfort, equipped with state of the art technology and handpicked amenities, for ultimate comfort, and comes with stunning views of the Marina Bay.. ",5
"By far the best hotel I have been so far!  The pros: 1. Iconic and picturesque view 2. Plenty of things to do - shopping, dining, party, shows, museum, swimming, and a lot more! 3. Convenient location 4. Spacious room and very comfortable bedding 5. Accommodating staff 6. Reliable wireless internet  The pros: 1. Checked in at tower 3 registration and I did not see a place where guests can wait (if needed). Saw other guests seated on the side of the hallway. 2. Nothing else I can think of. This place is just so beautiful!  'Five stars' is really not enough to rate this hotel as it's amongst if not the best in the world!",5
"Celebrated my birthday last Friday at the highly raved MBS hotel and there is really nothing to shout about. Check in was a tedious process (They named it ""Registration"").   One of our adult key pass was faulty and we went down to get it replaced but the server told us to use the kids pass instead. In the end, I was denied entry to the infinity pool and had to get Ian the floor manager to assist us. I was furious because the hotel just screw up my birthday celebration.   1. They need us to fill in a form on the birthday cake we bought in (for celebration) and they went ahead to ask what flavor is my birthday cake (in a very serious manner).   2. They warned us about the sensor in the fridge so technically speaking, you have a mini fridge in your room but you cannot use it. Once…",1
"I was upgraded to family suite room, Thank you Christin, A staff member of marina bay sands, she is very nice person, she took us to our room, what a nice service, she treated us very well :* , we stayed on 43 floor, garden view, check in was very smooth, as it's not very crowded at the time, we checked in @12 noon, after visiting gardens by the bay, shuttle service available from marina bay sands to gardens by the bay for 3SGD per pax, we were in tower 3, so it was about to 850 meteres walking distance, we enjoyed on way greenery and singapore flyer view too, we stayed here on 6-7th march. for a night. we were 6 people with 4 senior citizen. on 7th march after check out from hotel, we put our luggage with hotel only, and collected it in evening @8:30, it was very smooth, Thank…",5
"What a beatiful day spent at the Marina Bay Sands, tasting a worderful wine and eating execellent asian cousine, all mixed perfectly with a fantastic view of Singapore city and amazing friendship. Sithra was our waitress and she is amazing, offering the best of herself advising us always in good way about what to taste for an unforgettable afternoon on top of the world  Thank you Marina Bay Sands and Sithra!!",5
I've had this hotel in my mind as soon as I saw an article about their skyline infinity pool. Once I booked I took a huge gulp for how much money it was going to cost but it didn't disappoint! (My budget generally for accommodation is more like £80 a night not £250) On check in we got upgraded and all the guys working made me feel like I was a VIP guest. Short of winning the lottery I'll not stay again but it was 100% worth it just for the experience of watching sunrise in the pool not to mention the luxurious rooms and free light shows & events around the hotel. ,5
"Very nice hotel, we enjoyed our stay there. No complains.   It is just... When you go to the ground/lobby area, it is very very crowded like in the busy ""station"". If you are looking for quiet place, no the right option but if u enjoy ppl observing, this is exactly the right place.   Skypark/swimming pool and jacuzzis are crowded despite the strict entry. ",4
"It's no surprise that the Marina Bay Sands hotel, Singapore ends up very expensive if you do anything other than sleep in it. But really though, all hotels are if you order room service or drink the mini bar. With a plethora of celebrity chef restaurants to choose from, a great gym, which we used and other amenities including the amazing Skypark you're set to never need to leave the hotel. There are few hotels in the world which offer something as amazing as the Skypark not least for its engineering if you geek out on stuff like that, but for what it offers - simply breathtaking views over the seemingly never ending high rises and skyscrapers of the financial district. Get there for about 30 minutes before sunset even if you have no intention of swimming in the infinity pool but…",5
Stayed at the Marina bay sands for 1 night in a premier room. The room was huge with a large bath and breathtaking views of the city.  The infinity pool is just amazing but very busy.  Had in room dinning and everything was delicious the singapore slings are a must.  Would definatly return ,5
We did a nite tour and it was Absolutely stunning and we luved it so much we went bak for a second visit during the day and OMG we didn't think so but how AMAZING.... Wotta Fantastic Singapore Attraction!!!,5
Please imagine that you have great time with your boyfriend in this wonderful pool! Unfortunately everytime i visited MBS with my friends however i still had wonderful time! Room type is just so so but still have worth to visit here  ,5
Nothing better than sipping on Singapore Slings at the top of the Singapore skyline.  Make sure you mention you are headed to the rooftop bar to avoid having to pay for the observation deck.  Be wary of attire requirements - not thongs or swimwear allowed in the bar area.  And pick a night without haze - the views at sunset are spectacular!  It's one of my favourite views in Singapore.,5
"Being an architecture lover i was lucky to spend 2 nights at the MBS. Being quite a HUGE hotel the check in such as the check out proceeded very quickly. The staff is professional but remains friendly. My room was beautiful and wide with a city view: perfect! The Infinity pool is quite crowded but depending on the day's time you can get a front row place quite easily. Of course the view is amazing! While enjoying the moment, you can order some food from Spago which is delicious. I keep in mind MBS it's one of the main city's ""attractions"". So, is the price really worth it?... I was a bit disappointed to see an amount's difference between my booking confirmation and the check out' invoice. However, i DEFINITELY recommend this hotel.",4
"Room was luxurious, comfortable and had a clean, spacious bathroom. Pool views were incredible but the whole experience felt like being herded like cattle. Every available space was packed full of people, floors were slippery and dangerous, and there was loud building work going on throughout the day.  Lifeguards did not appear to be monitoring the pools as numerous times there were several children in the adult only section.  It was far from a relaxing atmosphere and was very disappointing considering the high price point. You are paying for the photos, not the experience. Check-in and check-out wait times were extremely long.   ",3
"This was our 2nd stay at the MBS, and we were celebrating the NYE 2016. As expected, (almost) everything went well. We love that the hotel is almost self contained. Mall and tube just next door, awesome riverside walk for running/jogging, and the coolest public park in SE Asia: Gardens by the Bay is only a few minutes nice walk away. Worth to note the lovely breakfast, so many quality choices, I really couldn't find any fault in it! Also at the same restaurant where they serve breakfast, they have the best fish n chips you can find outside of the UK!  After the second day though, the fact that MBS is quite a distance to city center has gotten a bit tiring. We love the Orchard Road vicinity especially on the holiday season as they close down the road for public entertainment and…",4
"Our was large but unfortunately had no bath tub! Should for the price of room, but besides that room was very good! Of course the roof top Infinity swimming pool & bars were the highlight of Marina Bay Sands. Worth seeing! Drinks over priced! Convenient shopping Mall adjoining the Hotel. A 24 hour express call service from room was excellent. Overall very happy with our experience!",5
This hotel is amazing and worth every penny. From the beautiful roof deck pool to the excellent service you really can't go wrong with staying at the Marina Bay Sands. They often offer upgrades which is quite lovely.,5
"Booked a premier room and enjoyed my staycation at the hotel! The room was spacious, balcony was huge and room service was pretty efficient. Probably the downside would be having to pay extra for the carpark coupon as an in-house guest. Nonetheless, it's a nice hotel for staycation despite it being a crowded hotel.",5
"We recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands whilst attending a conference.  This was our third stay at Marina Bay Sands.  The hotel is very large and constantly busy with large tour and conference groups.  It also attracts a lot of sightseers.    Check in was disappointingly slow.  We waited 30 minutes while a room was found for us.  I found it very strange that rooms were not assigned given that we had booked directly with the hotel well in advance of our stay and we were checking in after the scheduled check in time.  When we were finally given our non-smoking room on the 38th floor it had a strong smell of smoke.  We called customer service, explained that the rrom smelled of smoke and we would like to be moved due to my husband's allergies.   The first response was to restate to…",4
The Hotel has one of the best ambiances. The infinity pool is just amazing. The service staff is very slow and if you are thinking of taking a group over here and are expecting an early check in is next to impossible.   The breakfast spread of the hotel is just fantastic  The hotel is at a central location and it was great experience altogether,5
"There's no doubt that you have to put your hand into your pocket to stay here, but MBS exceeded my expectation.  It was only S$15 in a taxi to the hotel. Luggage service at the door was excellent, and although there is airline style queuing at the check in, they quickly identified us as upgraded and pulled us from the queue to priority check in. The suite on 49th floor was huge, well appointed bathroom and a great bath. View .. amazing. There's no mistaking this is a mega hotel with 2,500 rooms so it's good to plan and book eating options. We ate at Rise in the foyer of Tower 1 for the buffet dinner and it was superb. Breakfast the next day was hugely varied, fresh and hot. The skydeck pool is busy all the time until it closes late at night. We had clear weather & the views in…",5
"We read the reviews and yes it's an extremely large impersonal hotel and yes there is a waiting time for check in but aside from that, it is a luxury hotel that should on bucket lists. Our room was on the 30th floor, spacious and over looked the harbour and Gardens by the bay with a fabulous bathroom.  Perhaps one annoying thing was having to use the hairdryer out in the main room as there did,not appear to be plug in the bathroom. Beware the mini bar has an automatic charge connected to it, signs on the fridge to advise you The main attraction to this hotel would have to be the Skypark and infinity pool. Totally amazing and worth the stay. You do need to pick your times to go to the pool but wasn,t overly busy when we were there. Just love the touch of warm towels from the…",5
"Stayed here October 2015. I can agree with previous review that this hotel is more like an tourist attraction and a lots of tourists (that not stayed at the hotel) walked through the hotel, and that everything in the hotel was very overpriced. An yes, you feel like a room number, not like a guest. Long lines at check in. The hotel felt more like a tourist attraction than a 5 star hotel, but...if you ask me, this is a must when visit Singapore. The view over garden by the bay was amazing. The room itself was clean with a nice bathroom! Service was ok. The reason we booked Marina Bay Sands was the pool on the 57:th floor. It was awsome!! So cool looking down from 57 floor without a railing. But like I said before, lots of touists in the pool all day.",4
"Marina Bay Sands is a luxury hotel, where the service, check-in and check-out were very smooth. I enjoyed the food in the foodcourt of the adjacent mall. The room had a view over the Gardens of the Bay, which was fantastic. I can absolutely recommend this hotel for a one-of-kind experience. The infinity pool is an absolute must-try!",5
"A must visit to this Hotel. It also has a large mall having many many branded shops, an inside lake where you can enjoy boating and one of the largest Casinos. Do not forget to take your passports along if you want to visit the Casino.",5
"If it weren't for the SkyPark, I wouldn't consider this hotel all that exceptional.  That SkyPark, and specifically the infinity pool 57 floors above Singapore, are something else.  It was truly impressive to be in the pool at night or at dawn.  Although being in the pool at night is at times a little crowded.  Aim to be up on the roof at dawn, it's much more quiet and peaceful.  The hotel itself wasn't that great.  Don't get me wrong, the hotel and its amenities were top notch, but so too are many other hotels in this city.   That being said, my experience was lessened somewhat by the constant wind noise whistling past our window. It was a very windy night and we were a long way off the ground.  But still. Perhaps the seals around our balcony door weren't the best.  I don't…",4
"We had a room on the 21st floor, with city view. Would have been nicer higher up. I liked the two sinks in the bathroom and the separate toilet. They should have put a toilet with water cleaning for the price of the room.The bed was good.I slept very well. The rooftop pool with infinity pool is amazing.",4
"Two years ago we first saw this hotel and vowed that on our next visit to Singapore we would stay there. It is certainly worth a visit, but the size, activity and insanity of the selfie craze on the infinity pool on the 57 floor is not something everyone will like.  There are no quiet areas or lounges or garden areas to relax in as in the Shangri La. Marina Bay Sands is an intense hotel full of young people looking for an experience rather than a hotel to use as a relaxing base. For most of them the convention centre, theatre, casino and huge shopping mall are an essential part of the stay, but again this will not suit everyone.  The architecture and interior design are excellent and the choice of restaurants is superb. The staff are very helpful and friendly and the light and…",4
"We booked online and when we checked in, we got upgraded to a suite! The corner suite we stayed in had the view of the city and the water below. The room was very spacious and beds were super comfortable.   This entire hotel will give you a modern, classy, and luxurious experience.   (This post is a late one but better late than never...)",5
"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a week for a work conference.  With the hotel and gigantic connecting mall, restaurants and convention center, it was easy to sleep, eat, work out, shop, get my nails done, and do everything within MBS.  I took the sky high sunrise yoga class at the hotel's rooftop deck and that was the most memorable part of my stay there.  I also liked that there was a connecting train station so I could get off the property and meet up with local friends easily.",5
"Herded into the mammoth hall, lining up to check in, waiting while the bus load in front went through the formalities and the once in a not bad room, up to the roof filled with a million people in bathrobes for the obligatory swim and selfie in the infinity pool. I felt I was on a cross channel ferry or lost in a past it prime Las Vegas Casino.",1
"No issues with check in or out, despite some concerns from other reviewers. It's proximity to the gardens by the bay makes it so easy to go across and see the evening light show or get there for a walk early in the morning. The infinity pool is great, get up there before noon to have the beat chance of a bit if space and the best light for photographs.  We had a nice room, with a great view and the staff were all on point. Bit pricey on the food end of things, we found it hard to find something that wasn't high end or catering for the casino crowd. That said, it was a relaxing few days and, wow, the view at night from the skypark is something I won't forget any time soon. ",4
"As regular travellers to Singapore a friend and I decided it was about time we checked out the Marina Bay Sands. We were on the 43rd floor which afforded us virtually 360 degree views. The gardens and the bay, with its thousands of ships, from our room - the city from the lift lobby, Keppel Harbour from one end of the hallway and the fireworks that celebrated Lunar New Year at the other end..plus..be warned for those who have a room at the end....someone having a bath who was enjoying the view not realising they too were on view!  It rained the first day but we were happy to stay in the room and enjoy the views. The room was a very good size and you could have had a party in the bathroom with a second one in the shower alcove. Only complaint was as two single women we had…",5
"The hotel is very pretty from the outside and it has a great bar (on the top floor), however it is way too big and busy for my liking.  The check in was uneventful and my room was ok - however I think I was a little spoilt after just coming from the St. Regis.  The room had a great view (garden view Tower one).  However there is no bathtubs in Tower One - and I like my bath!    The bar upstairs is ok except it has no seating - there are tables but they are reserved for who I don't know!  The tables were always empty...  The drinks are overpriced however the view is amazing.    The security getting to the restaurant by the pool was horrible. My room wasn't ready on check in so they had given me a pool key while I was waiting.  I went upstairs to the restaurant (fully dressed and…",3

"Everyone's here for the breathtaking infinity pool of course, but before that.. Checking in was a breeze after being led to the vip room counters (since the main counter was jam packed, woes of being so huge).   We got tower 2, facing the gorgeous city, mid level (which is already quite high for me). Got to the room and oh my goodness, the sheer curtain just automatically opens up the city view like a warm welcome.. Room is massive with a bathroom to match. Love it so much i had a hard time sleeping as i just dazed at the city lights. Where else will you get a view like that!   Food around the area is pretty extravagant but its so convenient having an mrt just below or buses to the city (suntec or marina square for great restaurants and food courts at affordable ranges within…",5
"Stayed here with family and it was amazing. Definitely one to tick off the bucket list! Everything was amazing! The pool is incredible (despite all the selfies being taken), our one year old niece was with us and she enjoyed the pool also. The rooms are great. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that our stay was booked for months and when we arrived we found out that we were on the 5th floor with garden view and my family were on the 30th floor city view, we paid an extra £50 to have the room next door to them - but that said it was definitely worth doing. The city view is incredible, especially at night! We went to the gym also which was ok the highlight was the cold towels, free water and apples given on the way out!  I would definitely stay again! ",5
Nice place many things to do. Excellent view of Marina Bay. Nice to stay in your bed and see in the same time the skyline of Singapore. The pool on the top of the hotel is extremely nice. Hotel is always full. Don't look for discounts...huge hotel but always full of tourists.,5
"This is the iconic hotel within Singapore used on many tourist gifts and country marketing, it is a well deserved recognition.  The location is both suited for a business traveller being close to the centre of town as well as tourists and families being by gardens by the bay.  The hotel is architecturally unique, the towers and the rooftop infinity pool. The views from the roof are magnificent.  The room I had was a orchard suite overlooking the gardens by the bay. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in a hotel. The bathroom was larger than most apartment bedrooms with large shower and very comfortable bathtub. The only issue is that the shower drained slowly (not proper slope) and that the bathroom floor is very slippery when wet so use the towel or…",5
"This massive hotel is one of those ""bucket list"" destinations - stay there, even if only to tick it off your list. The infinity pool is amazing - the views remarkable.  This landmark is a truly amazing feat of engineering.  However for all the prestige, the infinity pool also a magnet for large waves of selfie-obsessed tourists who are so busy framing the perfect self-portrait that they forget to take in the views - and ruin the atmosphere.   Massive, and grandiose, the hotel is so large that it is very hard for the guest to feel like they are being treated as an important individual. Three towers of over fifty floors each - you get the picture.    However the staff are friendly, if very busy.  For all of this however, it is definitely a once in a lifetime experience.",4
"We stayed here for 2 nights. It is absolutely amazing and very fancy.  The highlight would have to be the infinity pool on the rooftop. It's not to busy as only hotel patrons are allowed access to use it.  Staff were very helpful. Our luggage was brought up by the bellboy. I ordered room service which was brought up to my room within 30 minutes and very tasty. Free wifi with a strong connection.   I highly recommend this hotel however please not it is pretty expensive, even the cafes/shops in the Shoppe are dear.",5
"My favorite place in Singapore for sure. Build up points and get to the Ruby room. In house restaurants are good with my favorite dish being the vegetable curry with rice. Simple but brings you back down to earth after a whirlwind winning streak. Always make a point to stay in the sands hotel as you will lose track of time in the casino... so at least you have a shower and bed within walking distance... and also when you simply can't sleep anymore, you can always walk back in.",5
"Yes, as many other reviewers have said, the infinity pool is the main reason that I booked my partner and myself into this hotel! This was the second time that I'd visited the hotel and I knew that my partner hadn't been before. While the rooms are outrageously expensive - more so than the standard room itself may be deserving of - the pool and upper level is amazing.   The first time I visited I had a standard room, which was small but very modern and tastefully furnished. The room itself was nothing to write about home about really.   The second time I visited we got super lucky and were taken out of the check-in line to the VIP where we were upgraded to a suite for free. While the suites are on the lower level, they really were luxury! A huge balcony, large open bedroom and…",4
"The hotel is very, very nice. Unique location, between the Gardens by the bay and the Bay of Singapore. We have been granted with a very nice room at level 44, which had a astonishing view to the Gardens and to the Singapore Strait. The room was very comfortable, clean and all our requests were immediately replied. The swimming pool at level 57 is always crowded, but definitely worth the view. From the sky lounge you will be able to have one of the best views over the city.  The staff is very nice and they always try to guarantee you have a unique experience. Unfortunately we only stayed one night.",5
"Hotel is good. View also nice, I like swiming pool. I always stay 5star hotel but people are not polite here. I mean very rude. They nice to European and American people, but they don't respect Asian costomer especially Korean and Japanese. 今まで色んな５つ星ホテルに宿泊したが、マリーナベイサンズは期待してただけにがっかりだった。見た目は確かに派手だが、ホテルオオクラやリッツカールトンに比べると、大きいせいもあるが、3つ星以下のサービスだった。インド人の従業員もいるが、チップを渡すと少なくて気に入らなかったせいか、ドアを閉める間際に仲間従業員と、客の悪口を言ってるのが聞こえたので、高い料金を払ったのに非常にがっかりした。朝食も5000円くらいするが、土地柄あまり美味しくはなかった、ここでもオムレツを焼いてるインド人の方の態度が非常に横柄だった。派手なのが好きな若者向けのホテルだが、富裕層や一流のホテルを知ってる人は泊まらない。",1
"This is the 4th time I was staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Indeed, the most satisfying stay I have experienced as compared to previous occasions. A significant improvement and the feeling of comfort and warm hospitality.  Starting from arrival, I was greeted immediately by the concierge in attendance who were so polite and friendly in handling my luggage. Checking into the hotel was as pleasant, as it took less than 10 minutes to complete all the necessities. Though I arrived early, it was great to hear that the room was already available to check in.   On entry to the room, it gave me a warm and cosy feeling. It was so well kept, clean, with warm lighting effect, pleasant furnishing/decor as well as spacious. In less than 5 minutes, my luggage arrived to my room. It was…",4
"That's amazing view in swimming pool,I really love there.But the price is high ,Hahahaha ! Wanna go again ............just went there with my friend and enjoyed our holiday for the sky pool.Hope to come again here with my partner~~~~~~~~~~",5
"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Marina Bay Sands last week - the infinity pool was incredible (although a tad chilly?)  Amazing view.  Great rooftop bars.  Fabulous amenities, restaurant options, shoppes!  My only gripe would be that we had mentioned it was my 40th birthday, then were asked via email before our arrival if we wanted a Double or King room - we requested a King, and then at check in, were given two double beds to sleep separately in for the week. When you're spending $400+/night and asked what you'd prefer, it's surprising to be given something less.    Be sure to check out the raw honeycomb at the cheese buffet at Rise, and don't miss the Ham and Brie croissants at Sweet Spot!  A morning ritual every day!",5
"I stayed 3 nights here as part of a business trip, which included access to the rooftop infinity pool.  The view of the Singapore Harbor is breathtaking, which can be seen from the infinity pool 650 feet above the ground.  On the other side of the roof, there is an amazing view of the Gardens By The Bay.  To top it off, the city was preparing for the Formula 1 race, so everything was lit up at night.  My visit was in Sept 2012.  Do yourself a favor and book at least 2 nights here to enjoy the space.  The room was also quite luxurious with views of the city out one side and views of the Gardens on the other.",5
Was at this hotel in January 2016. To start with staff is very helpful and polite as expected from a 7 star hotel. Bags arrived quickly at the room.  I was at 47th floor with the city view. Must say that city view was amazing az. I could watch the light show sitting in my room. Room was super clean but i believe it had things missing. Shower was not like a 7 star and bath salt was missing. Rom service made my room without my permission to enter.   Infinity pool and observatory deck is as seen in pictures but more thrilling. one of the best experience you can ever get. pool is not too crowded either.  Overall great hotel to stay,4
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands a few days for our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience. We spent most of our time lounging and relaxing by the infinity pool wich has a breathtaking view. Our room was spacious, clean with a spectacular view over the harbor. The staff were all so lovely and helpful.",5
"Been to this hotel 4 times already, and i can say the only edge of this hotel from the rest of the 4-5 star hotel is the Infinity pool, the pool itself is an attraction wherein you got the feeling of you are on top of everything floating in waterand that is an amazing feeling. For Rise restaurant , they have a variety  of food which is good for all travellers, but its just a bit noisy coz its located right at ground floor area wheren people passes by even those who are not guest, but accessibility wise , it really is accessible by trains, bus or cabs, and this time our room is right across the Tree of gardens by the bay and its a beautiful to see those lights at night. the reception area is just a super busy jam packed area of the hotel. the bitter part of it, is when we ask the…",4
"Really not worth the money in my opinion.  Took us 30 minutes to check in. There were quite a few people in the queue which is unavoidable for a hotel of this size, however they didn't even bother opening all of the check in desks. One of the concierges took us to the 'VIP' check in, which probably made the wait even longer as the VIP check in is much smaller.  The room itself is a good size and well furnished. We had a great garden view on the 45th floor. However, the shower was woeful. The water pressure was non existent with water dribbling out of the sub par shower head mounted to the wall. It is definitely not a 'rain shower' that you expect from a top hotel.  The only reason we stayed here was for the pool, and the view is unbeatable. We went straight for the adults only…",3
"It's that kind of hotel which you must visit only for his fame and handsome view, that's all.  There are so many people I was feeling like in the city centre. Busy staff everywhere ..but it is normal in the hotel like this. We had handsome city view room but it was a room for smokers and we don't smoke, so we didn't like that smell.   Service and food was good but overpriced. You can rather go eat to shopping mall which is connected with hotel. We were satisfied with very fast check-in and check-out! There are lots of activities near the hotel which is great advantage.",4
"This is a hotel to behold, I was gobsmacked upon entering the lobby area! I knew we had a nice hotel booked but this far exceeded my expectations!  It is pricey for food & drink but that could be said for Singapore in general.  There is a vast selection for most tastes for breakfast too.  The staff, ambience & views in the spago restaurant (on the 57th floor) is simply the best.  The waiters & waitresses in this particular restaurant are incredibly attentive & have a great sense of humour, making breakfast time a wonderful experience. Thank you",5
Loved the hotel. I've read on here about the check in being a bit of a nightmare. When we arrived we were taken to the VIP area and checked in straight away. I booked a deluxe room with city view which didn't disappoint. Staff were very attentive and helpful. It is expensive but it was worth it and would do it again.  The room was clean and large. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was also spacious.  Shopping is close by at a massive shopping area attached to the hotel and if you don't want to eat at one of the hotels many restaurants there is transport nearby in the form of the SMRT station at the hotel or taxis. The restaurants are on the pricey side but I would highly recommend Spago restaurant on the top floor for the buffet breakfast.  The downside is that there is…,4
Got for a club room as a surprise for my wife and in my opinion it was worth the money - the extras at Club 55 and the friendliness of the staff made our stay fantastic.  Room itself - on the 47th floor was the size of a studio apartment with a spacious bathroom.  Free bottled water was to be expected plus the nespresso machine was a good touch.  The pool was less busy than I envisaged and for some periods of the day there weren't that many people there.    Afternoon tea and drinks and canapes were also excellent.  The spread was great - the drinks were generous and on the strong side.  Overall something to tick from the bucket list.  Enjoyed and recommended,5
"I did love this hotel, the rooms were fabulous and were a great size! Check in was super fast and the staff could not have been friendlier. The infinity pool at the top was nothing short of fabulous! The only downfall I would say was it was extremely busy..when you're coming back from an action packed day its nice to just come in to a quiet lobby and relax in your room but the hustle and bustle in the lobby alone would be quite overwhelming! Nevertheless, I would still recommend this hotel and would definitely return one day!",5
It was an amazing experience for us to stay at MBS. the location is perfect and its easy for us to grab food and go shopping since its very connected to the main mall. and its very close to the subway station. We really enjoyed swimming at the top in the morning as well as in the night.,5
"Stayed in Orchid Suite for 3 nights and had a spectacular view on level 47. We could watch the entire Singapore skyline and garden's light show from our room.   Nice dinner in Ce La Vi and superb views. Overall, a great stay. No doubt we will be back!",5
"Best place to stay in Singapore. Infinity pool to die for. Some really breathtaking views of the South China Sea and Ships. Gigantic showers, double sinks, huge rooms. We stayed in one above the basic. Gardens by the Bay at your doorstep. If you stay anywhere else, it just won't feel right.",5
"This hotel has friendly staff, great amenities and just overall amazing rooms. I would say this is definitely a hotel you need to stay at once in your life time. The pool itself will already win you over but the cleanliness of the hotel and what the hotel has to offer is definitely put this property at the top of the list.",5
Receptions available at all 3 towers. 2 guests cards given each room for entrance to the Swimming Pool. Kids will also have their own guest cards. Wifi is ok. Room view is beautiful. Garden/City view. Sunrise view is for Garden View room. Complimentary bithday cake. Nice toiletries. No bidet in bathroom. Kiblat direction available (found in wardobe) for muslim guests. Tv has many channels. The pool is large with jacuzzi on the the opposite & kids pool right at the end. Toilet from swimming pool a bit troublesome as you need to bring along your access card otherwise unable to pass through.,4
"Marina Bay Sand is definitely an iconic landmark of Singapore due to its design and the infinity pool. Had a chance to stay there for 3 day in November 2015 but unfortunately, it does not meet up with my expectation.  Being an iconic of Singapore, I do expected much more from the hotel, especially when it is a 5* hotel in Asia. However, maybe because the iconic part of the hotel put them down. The area is too crowded. It took more than 30 minutes for them to check me in and there was even a problem of taking pre-payment from my card which they had to use a different machine 3,4 times to process my payment. Yet, they did offer to upgrade my room. Still, after 20 hours of flight and transit, I did not want to stand there and wait for more than 30 minutes for checking.  In term of…",3
"Booked as a present for my boyfriend's birthday as it was on his bucket list. We stayed for our last night in Singapore after a month overseas. The infinity pool is amazing, in that it has a good view, but that's where the sparkle ended for us.  Rooms are very corporate, just another hotel room like any we'd stay in for work. I do concede the bathroom was luxurious.   Check in was painful as there are loads of people in a massive queue, the service certainly doesn't feel personal or 5 star. That's not a slight on the staff, who were very efficient, but more a failing of the building design having check in right where tourists wander through to various restaurants.   We had a garden view room on the 4th floor and the traffic noise was very loud, the glazing certainly needs…",2
"It might look expensive, but hotels in Singapore are anyway very expensive... But anyway it worth the money: rooms are huge, nicely decorated and with amazing view. Complimentary access to the infinity pool and to the Sky observation deck is included in the room price, but of course the infinity pool on top of the hotel is really, really a must go. They also provides free towels and robes for the pool too.",5
"My husband and I stayed at this great hotel for 1 night, being our wedding anniversary and had an amazing time. The hotel upgraded us and send us a cake to our room. Also, when we had dinner at Cheese and Chocolate Bar were given a nice table and an anniversary cake. We loved the concept in that restaurant and the view is just perfect!! We spent most of our time at the infinity pool, drinking cocktails and enjoying the pool and jacuzzi. It is quite crowded during the day, but the sunset and the evening are wonderful. We liked the adult only part of the pool.  Room was huge, with a balcony and with a view of the Singapore Bay, we loved it! Hopefully, we will be able to celebrate one of our next anniversaries here again, since it has become one of our favorites....",5
"This is definetely a five star hotel. The main thing is the pool and the view. Service was excellent everywhere in the hotel. And if you want to eat your breakfast in peace, then go to 55 floor restaurant.",5
"Went to this hotel for lunch on the 57th Floor - C'est la vie, amazing taster menu, superb views across the Singapore skyline and Marina bay, excellent service, attention to detail amazing and reasonably priced, go for lunch, walk in the shopping mall and enjoy the views from the 57th Floor.",5
"This iconic hotel is one of the ""must see"" places in Singapore, if not the world.   Everything is awesome, at a price. If you can afford it, you must stay there. Fantastic friendly efficient staff, large fully equipped rooms with wonderful views.  Great places to eat and a very large shopping mall and casino integrated.   And now the ""but"" ..... Checking in is to say the least abysmally chaotic and that is putting it mildly. Long lines and very slow progress but when you get there it's with it.   Special thanks to Kalai our Guest Services Bell boy.  By the way, checking out is automated and easy!",4
"I have stayed in this hotel a few times across the years and there was one experience that was really awful. One day I left the hotel early in the morning and returned around 2pm thinking the room would have been cleaned. Nope. It was rather disappointing because most other hotels I have stayed in have room service in the morning to ensure guests return/ check in to a clean room. So never-mind, called the reception to ask for room service and was being told ""if you want room service you have to put the sign up"" Told her that I did and she replied that she will send someone over. No apologies whatsoever and made me feel it was my fault that my room was not cleaned. Since I feel uncomfortable to be in the room during room service, had to force myself to go out and walk aimlessly…",2
Marina bay sand was on my  bucket list since long time. I love the pool but was full of people and difficult to take photos with so many people. It's Expensive but worthy to visit for one night only for the infinity pool. Amazing view from the pool.,5
My Fiance and I stayed at this superb hotel for 3 days. We had a Garden view room on level 42. The view of the Gardens by the Bay was spectacular that on the first night we could watch the entire garden's light show from our room. It was super clean and room service was very good too. The infinity pool on level 57 had a beautiful view and was busy at all times. The only down side about the pool was that it was a little dirty and unfortunately the food served by the pool was terrible and too expensive. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.,5
We booked an Ocean View room with balcony on the 41st floor facing Gardens by the Bay. Rooms are extraordinarily large that also had large bathrooms. Breakfast was much better at the Ground Floor compared to the Sky Park sans the view. The room was nice but I thought that it was a little bit overpriced. ,4
"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for our 2 year anniversary. Marina Bay was one of the two hotels that we stayed at in Singapore, the other one being Oasia Hotel in Novena. After experiencing the amazing service that the staff in Oasia has provided for us, we were slightly underwhelmed when we first arrived at Marina Bay Sands considering the premium price tag. We had 5 bags between the two of us and we were struggling a little bit. The concierge did not offer us any help and we were not greeted upon arrival. The reception staff that checked us in however picked up the slack for concierge oversight. He was friendly and polite, and he managed to find a room for us on the high floor even though we were slightly early. He even offered us with bag assistance, which…",5
"There is nothing like this anywhere in the world. Huge stunning hotel, casino, shopping mall me aomuch more. The hotel is topped by a huge ship shPed structure that nasal infinity pool. It is brilliant in concept and execution. Go see it.",5
Loved this hotel although lobby is massive and nit solely for the hotel. Rooms nice and modern and sky pool and bar are great. Ku de ta is on top and was  nice for drinks though very expensive. Stayed in a room with Lounge access- not sure it worth the extra though u less you get there early to avail of free drinks! ,5
"We loved our stay here. We got a good deal from booking.com for a city view room. Room was large, modern with a great view of the city and water. The hotels amenities were the excellent. We arrived off a flight early in the morning before our room was ready, so used the spa to have a shower and these were nice and clean. It is a really big hotel so can be a bit overwhelming with the amount of people everywhere in this hotel but we didn't mind it, we knew what we were in for staying here. The pool area as expected was excellent!!! Best pool ever.  A million people taking selfies in the pool but everyone having fun. We had drinks on the last night at Sky 57 and it was NZD $130 for 4 drinks. But oh well you only live once, and the views up here were fantastic and the staff went out…",5
"Me and my husband stayed in a suite for two days in October 2015 and everything was just awesome. The food was great, the service was extraordinary,  the room was great. We spent a lot of time at the top floor with the infinity pool and the restaurants and bars. We could find a sun bed at any time and was offered drinks from the nice staff. I highly recommend this hotel for any occasion- it was a once in a lifetime experience!",5
"It is the biggest and best organised hotel we have ever stayed. The pool on the roof speaks for itself. The personal touch can be lost immediatly because of the huge dimensions and wide variety of different outlets but not if you have the great Concierge Team around Erin Ono who made the stay warm, personalised and unforgettable.",5
"Some may think I am crazy but I have stayed at the Marina Bay Sands around 12 times to be exact, most of my trips were work related. Yes you get the lovely large rooms, with beautiful views and the super large swimming pool and those bed sheets bla bla bla bla bla ..... who cares !!! Like any other hotel.    The difference is the View, Casino, really cool guy who brings his ipad into the sauna showing every male how many beautiful girls he has for a price (PIMP), anyway someone complained and now he is out. Nice shopping center, beauftifil garden etc..... everyone has written about it.   Here are some real facts about the MBS - firstly there is no customer service, no personal service, there is noooooooo HELLO HOW ARE YOU TODAY, the breakfast is nice but nothing fancy…",4
"Had a room with the view on a bay. The huge window-wall - gives you amazing view at night. Shopping, restaurants, facilities, service - simply amazing Had a great experience during my stay-cation.  Definitely will recommend this place to my family & friends",5
"Overall - I would say MBS is a nice hotel. However, I don't think it's the place for everyone, particularly if you like to feel relaxed and not having to battle through the crowds pretty much everywhere you go.  Location/Transport: the closest MRT station is Bayfront, which is on the yellow Circle line. BEWARE however this is part of the extension, so you will have to change at Promenade again before you can get to Bayfront. Coming from the airport and using the circle line we had to change a total of 3 times. We subsequently noticed that Bayfront seems to be on the blue Downtown line as well, which may be a better option but we did not try that. The trip was quite long but it was cheap (less than SGD6 for two).  On our way out we took a cab to the airport - note that depending…",4
"Really can't fault this place.Friendly helpful staff, lovely room, very clean,great location,lovely building. Can be busy sometimes but hey it is a big hotel.  We had a large room on 38th floor with a great view of Singapore skyline and across  Would definitely stay again",5
"Marina Bay Sands is the perfect place to stay if you just want to relax & enjoy the hotel facilities.   The roof top pool is amazing, the views are breathtaking ! Hotel rooms are big but furnishing & decorations are average.   We stayed 3 nights at the hotel, didn't have to go out of the hotel as there are so many nice international standard eateries inside the complex. Plenty of branded shops if you like shopping and also the casino is inside the complex too.   There is a interconnection bridge that leads you outside to the beautiful Gardens By The Bay. Singapore Flyer is within walking distance from the hotel.   ",5
"great architecture' , good organisation and service . a bit expensive and the beds are hard and a bit short for tall people, but the view and the fantastic infinity rooftop  pool make up for this. fantastic bathroom with good shower.",4
"Stayed here for a week and my first visit to Singapore, this hotel is fantastic if you love comfort and entertainment and shopping and atmosphere, probably not suitable for the people who like to chill and do nothing. The room had an excellent view on level 45 and we had a city view which is much better than the other side of the hotel the garden view. Great views at night and if you go to level 57 you are right at the top of the hotel with great views at night and take your camera. If you like Las Vegas Hotels you will like this one, you walk from the hotel underground to a huge shopping mall with every designer name known, not just small shops but large designer shops some on two levels so if you want to spend loads of cash on designer gear then you will love this place.…",5
Let's go down to the main point: go there for the swimming pool. You can't miss it while in Singapore but can't access it if you are not a guest of the hotel. Then you will appreciate the spacious room and the service. The lobby however is ugly and looks like an airport.,5
"Its famous infinity pool, and Sky Park both offer a generous and an entertaining panoramic view of the city, esp at night. Shopping centers, and the Gardens by the Bay are within reach. Will likely not really recommend this hotel to families with young children. The lobby is pretty chaotic, perhaps because the targeted market is more on the gambling and shopping crowd. The atmosphere here is quite the opposite of what youd get in most hotels in Sentosa, so it's really a matter of preference. ",3
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on our last night of our holiday as a great ending! The checking-in and checking-out-process was quiet time-intense which is understandable for such a huge hotel. Once achieved you are more than impressed of that breathtaking swimmingpool at the 57th floor - implied you find where to lay as it is very crowdy up there. We were lucky as we found two beach loungers directly at the front line of the pool - amazing! As the pool is open until 11 pm you can enjoy your time watching the sun go down over Singapore. A great experience!!!,5
This is a destination hotel with a wow factor. Stayed in one of the club rooms which gave us access to Club 55. This worked out to be amazing value for money as the canapés were to die for and the Piper champagne was on tap!,5
"This was the last stop of a month of traveling, we definitely saved the best until last! The staff were friendly and efficient. We had a room overlooking the Marina, which was very spacious and had an enormous bathroom.  The pool is amazing!! The views are great. It is nice to enjoy a cocktail whilst watching the sun set. There are many shops and restaurants attached to the hotel. The food court in the mall is definitely worth a visit.  Well worth a stay.",5
"What is there not to like about Marina Bay Sands Hotel!! Infinity Pool - Unbelievable Service & rooms & unrivalled views of Singapore Marina.   Me & my Partner stayed just the one night on route to Australia & what a night it was. We were upgraded to the Orchard Suite on our arrival with free breakfast by the lovely receptionist. The orchard suite had unbelievable views of the Marina!   The infinity pool is what attracted us to the hotel & it did not let us down. I think it is a great idea that the hotel keep the use of the pool strictly for their hotel guests. It was fairly busy but as you would expect, there were wannabe photographers wanting to get the best shots including me!   This hotel exceeded expectations & can't wait to go back there! ",5
"This is an impressive hotel no matter which way you look at it. Stayed there for a conference and so the rates were very reasonable. First impression when you walk in is wow, its huge, the staff are efficient, and even with a queue at check in it was all despatched quite quickly. The rooms, even the basic ones are lovely, and on the 34 floor - so not very high (here) - you had wonderful views over the boats in the harbour. The pool on the roof is something else, never got time to use it as only there a couple of days (and forgot my swimmers!) but I have never seen an infinity pool like it, and judging by the number of people at the edge taking pictures neither had anyone else. To summarise this is one hell of a hotel, with so many restaurants, shops coming out of your ears, and…",5
"We visited this hotel on two occasions ( to gain access to the Gardens in the Bay and also to visit the sky park on top of this hotel), we just couldn't believe how busy and noisy the foyer was with people checking in and out, the hotel is vast and so are the queues, it's more like an airport check in than a hotel!  The hotel is linked to the Casino across the road and must be popular with the casino clientele as there's no way you would volunteer to be put through what we witnessed unless you had an ulterior motive. Might be utopia for some but as I say, do your homework if you are thinking of staying here.",2
We stayed in the hotel at the end of our South Aisa trip also consisting of Bali and KL.  From the moment we walked into Marina Bay Sands we were treated exceptionally and enjoyed every moment. We were able to be upgraded to the next grading of room and about 20 floors higher than initially booked and entered the room to find rose petals in the bath (I can not remember the request i made)  We had a large room with a great view over the Botanical Gardens near the hotel and from the hotel can explore the surrounding areas. Just walking through the hotel and to the connecting casino and mall can take up a few hours.  The pool at the top of the hotel is obviously a HUGE selling point for the hotel - but was totally worth the room fee and we were able to enjoy time in the pool and on…,4
"Marina Bay Sands is a casino hotel located in the Marina Bay area. Annexed to the hotel is a shopping mall with an excellent choice of restaurants.   The hotel building itself is massive (with 2500 rooms) – but that meant the lobby area being very busy, noisy and crowded (with both guests and visitors) especially during peak periods. This also meant that you’d get certain sections of the crowd misbehaving in an anti-social manner.   Checking in was prompt and professional, but with so many guests, service could get a bit impersonal and hurried.   During our stay, we had problems with the room card – couldn’t access to the room floor in the lift, and when the card was changed, we couldn’t get into our room. And walking to and from the lobby took quite a while due to the size of…",3
"I am a Singaporean and of course it is a must to try staying at MBS. Room is okay, i guess the highlight is the infinity pool. I came on a Saturday and I was surprised and very lucky that there weren't many people that day. Just my luck. There are staffs nearby so it was pretty convenient to order some fries and mocktails by the pool.    The staffs handling the phone calls are really professional too. They also send me a cake 30 minutes after check in as it was a birthday so that was very sweet. Will definitely come back, especially for the infinity pool.",4
Beautiful hotel. Stunning lobby says it all. Shops and restaurants and casino underground. Entrance to MRT station underground. Walk to gardens by the bay from the 6th floor. They have everything from a 7/11 to money exchange. Money exchange downstairs cheaper opens at 10. Change money there if you need a little and then I found a place at harbour front upstairs when you leave MRT stations.  I had a beautiful view of the harbour from my room. Very busy hotel. An infinity pool and gorgeous view of the city from the 54th floor on the roof .,5
"We spent 2 nights at the Marina Bay Sands in their club room. The room was nice and the bathroom was spacious. The service was very good and the good excellent. Highly recommended the club option since breakfast from 3 of their really cool restaurants are included. Also afternoon tea and canepes with unlimited cocktails are included! The first day we had our breakfast at the club on 55th floor and the view was amazing. Great service and good selection of cold breakfast but not so much on hot breakfast. Afternoon tea and canepes were great, we really enjoyed that. On the 2nd morning we went to spago, their bar and restaurant on the 57th floor (opposite to the pool) and it was fantastic! The vibe, the decor.. absolutely loved that place. The gym is pretty decent and again amazing…",4
"at the end of our five day trip, we opted to spend our last night here at marina bay sands.   the main attraction was for us to be able to use their infinity pool located at the top of the hotel.   the hotel rooms were large modern and comfortable.  you have to use your keycards to be able to access the rooftop skypark.   a bit crowded with chinese tourist and we were fortunate to get lounging chairs next to the pool.   never gave up our good find until right into early evening.   practically spent the whole day at the pool. except for toilet breaks.",5
Marina bay sands is a must visit place in singapore. The restaurants are fabulous with absolute dining. I really loved the bakery down the tower 3.the infinity pool is a wonder of the world.when you go there its just amazing.the marvellous view. Its a must to see the infinity pool.,5
"I agree giving only one point for this hotel seems a bit unfair but I want people to read my review and from my experience I had here this place does not deserve more than two of the five points. We stayed in MBS from 17.-21.2.  First of the positive things:  1. Obviously the pool with the roof top. Although it is mainly ""show"". Mostly way too windy to really enjoy it and the place is packed with people - mostly Chinese with five selfie sticks each.  But the view is for sure one of the best in Singapore.   2. Also very good is the room if you are lucky to get a quiet one - will come to that soon. The bed is one the best beds I have had in hotels. The cleaning staff is very nice - we left her some tip every day and she created funny small towel animals. Cleaned properly and…",1
"Words don't have enough power to tell you how it feels to be truly mesmerized. I sat, speechless, for hours watching the sunset. Never felt so close to greatness. To understand fully, is best TO BE here. I still feel grateful and humbled. In my heart, I never left this magical place",5
"The hotel is hughe, its good to have seen it. Bit its better to stay in anothet hotel, where service is much better (For ex Capella hotel, Mandarin Oriental)  But the service was pretty bad for a hotel with such a standard. It feels very impersonal and most very normal requests were answered with a ""no not possible"". television didnt function properly and nothing was done to fix it It feels a bit like a factory.  The pool is really amazing, the views are fantastic.",3
"Oh my gosh, what can I say about a view like that?  uh… AMAZING!  Listen, I am not going to lie to you, I never have, not going to start now… this place is crazy expensive. Also, I really didn’t like how big it was. The personal touch on the hotel side is definitely lost, and getting anywhere whether it is the pool or a taxi needs ample time. Okay, those are my bad points. Now for the good… we stayed here over New Year’s Eve, facing the city*, and when I tell you it was the most amazing display of fireworks I have ever seen, I mean it! Seriously people, they were right there! Beautiful, amazing, once-in-a-lifetime moment. So splurge if you can and go for it!          *Try to face the city for New Year's Eve. If not, that is okay. The other side of the hotel still has gorgeous…",4
Club 55 offer a unique buffet dinner of Chocolate and Cheese and being on level 55 of the hotel the views from the restaurant are superb overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and most of Singapore.  The food is excellent with about 20 cheeses to try with a variety of breads and crackers and nearer 50 desserts to enjoy.  They also offer to accompany the cheese 3 wines at a set price of 19 SGD.  this is an excellent way to spend an evening and enjoy dinner,5
"Wonderful view of Singapore skyline and across. Best time we visited was around 6 pm. You get the best of both - day view, night view.  You can purchase ticket at basement 1 counter.. After spending some time, walk towards waterfront promenade for 8 pm or 9.30 pm light and water show",5
"It's hard to rate this a five star for the money based on everything..until you get to the pool...OMG...an infinity pool towering over the awesome beauty that is Singapore .its hard to describe how incredible and thoughtfully designed is this masterpiece..it more then made up for a room that had more like a 250 dollar a night feel vs the 450 I paid..they were nice enough to give me a delayed check out of 3pm as I was flying out close to midnight , but when I showed up at my room to pack at 2:25 the key had been disabled and the front desk had no record of the 3 pm checkout I was given by the check in person..that is inexcusable ..I had to basically turn into irritated customer guy to get it rectified..not my choice to be that guy! Also slow check out 40 mins later as only one…",4
"This hotel is really in a prime location, walking distance to practically everything you would want, including the huge mall across the street. Checking in was slightly stressful. So many check-in counters, but I guess there's no choice when it's such a huge hotel. Beautiful lobby. However, the room itself was just average. It wasn't bad, just nothing really outstanding. You're paying for the view of course, which is spectacular! The famous roof top pool is better in pictures than in person, mainly due to the large crowd that it attracts. Doesn't call for a relaxing ambience at all. Breathtaking view no doubt, but very cold water and too crowded. I'd be ok with it if it was just adults, but honestly I felt like the kids dominated the place! For the price, there should be a…",4
"Stayed there one night only just to experience the infinity pool. It took too long time to check in but finally we got good room with Gardens by the Bay view. It was just awesome at night. The way to the pool was really complicated ,we stayed at tower 2, 8 floor so we need transfer 2 times before we get to the pool. Undoubtedly, views from the pool and observation deck were just fantastic, had a feeling you can watch them forever. We also went to free show just near the main entrance of the shopping mall, time was 8pm and 9.30 pm. Really nice show. Room was good, with balcony. Check out was very quick. We didn't have any deposit so just filled the check out form , drop into the special box and after 2 h recieved email we were successfully checked out. Try the casino downstairs,…",5
"We stayed here for 1night only... Wish the stay was longer, but it was awesome. The check in was quick and smooth, they even upgraded the room 1up. Room was very comfortable, spacious, even the bathroom. Service was to the mark. The pool has a gorgeous view, and the towel station has warmed towels :D The upper deck at night gives an amazing view of Singapore bay, harbour, Gardens by the bay, Flyer. The bar was good, with ample choices.",5
"A Landmark of Singapur, A landmark for great Hotel and Resort business - Its luxury pure and also clean, more clean than the rest of Singapur, as this city is promoted ""Clean"" so much and in reality is not really ...... The Hotel has everything of luxury - the rooms are enough large, even we had a little problem upon arrival as our bathroom was not cleaned from last user ! But the apologies have been ok.... Parking the car there is even for a guest expensive - food and breakfast you better go to the mall and the food court - but having a drink or dinner at the pool bar or restaurants is outstanding and for this location even not too pricy ! Pool is too crowded but it s clear - its just great up there !!",5
"This is a truly remarkable hotel. Everything is very structured to ensure smooth and easy check in/out. Stayed to a short check in line. The rooftop pool is the main attraction and really worthy. Awesome view of the bay. Nice room, comfy bed. Excellent breakfast buffet. Great shopping and casino, budget permitting.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is located at the Promenade station on the yellow line. The yellow line and the rest of the MRT system is simple and transferable with much ease and you can get from one end of Singapore to the other end in just about an 1hr.  Once you exit from Promenade station, you will be in the premises of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. This is the building itself and you will see a lines and lines of designer stores.  If you are a ""cityscape hunter"", outside of the MBS is where you should be. Alternatively, you can have access to the Skypark which is he very top of the MBS. Sunrise and Sunsets are the two best times as the skies lend a beautiful backdrop to the concrete jungle that is Singapore. You could have gone to the MBS a few times but you could still find the…",4
"Amazing place to stay . Swimming pool  ""Guests only"" is awesome with fantastic views. Hotel,restaurants and staff fantastic.  If you can just ""do it"" like we did and spend the bucks to stay there at least once. You wont be disappointed",5
"WE stayed for 3 nights. Even though this is a large hotel with 2500 rooms the service and quality was excellent. We had a basic room which was very spacious and comfortable, the restaurants' were excellent and the service very good. The skypark on the 57 floor was amazing. a must visit hotel.",5
"After spending 3 nights at the Conrad we decided to move away the last night to the Marina Bay Sands to enjoy the famous pool, but not worth it. The hotel is huge, impersonal, in fact does not appear a hotel when you enter inside but a huge crowded mall, with people everywhere. However, both the check in and check out were fast and efficient. The room is fine, is very large with a small balcony. Our room was a Premier one, overlooking the rear, the Gardens by the Bay and the sea, a 40th floor with great views. And the pool was disappointing. It is always overcrowded. The hotel has almost 2500 rooms, and I think most people come to this hotel for the pool. The views are spectacular, but so many people do that it loses all the charm. I think it is much better to pay one day the…",3
"I and my wife stayed on the 20th floor in the hotel, in a club room and managed to get dual aspect from the hotel room itself. The room was very large and nice with a decent size balcony facing the Marina bay gardens.  The pool on the top was great, ""have to see/do thing for me - tck in the box"", but the pool was soo busy with people and swimming to the ""edge"" it felt, to me, being outside the pool, by the pool side, overlooking Singapore, is far better than being inside the pool. It has to do with the optical ilusion of the infinity pool edge.  The best of all things was the club room, with breakfast, afternoon tea, or for the 5pm-7PM evening slot with free champagne, wine and beer. The food was really good and you go and pick what you prefer yourself. I would highly recommend…",4
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a few nights in January. I arrived a little early but front desk agent Vance Kok made me feel very welcomed.   Arrived at my room and was blown away upon entering. The amazing Marina Bay view, the large bathroom and comfy bed was really inviting. A few minutes later, my fruit basket amenity arrived. I didn't see a mini fridge, but there was a safe, a pull out sofa bed and a large work desk.  Infinity pool. Probably the reason most people choose to stay here. Take the elevator up to the 57th floor and enter through the gate with your key card. There's also an observation deck on that level, as well as a night club and restaurants. The pool was pretty crowded at all times, but it was an amazing sight to see. At night, the Singapore skyline lights…",5
"Was invited by a family friend to stay for 2 nights.  Considering the hotels that I have stayed in Singapore, the room is spacious. It may be a higher end room (it has 2 queen beds and a huge bathroom with bathtub). Love the high floor view facing the Singapore river, both day and night scenes are great. That's the best part location wise. However, there are not many activities to do within the vicinity other than visiting the casino, art science museum and the theatres. Orchard Road is nearby though. ",5
"We stayed here last year during our mini vacation with family. Considering the brand associated with this hotel, we expected excellent service. But to our surprise it wasn't up to mark. The reception during our checking in was crowded like a Indian Mela. We had wait almost for 1 hour..    The rooms were good and best part was the roof top pool and the view ...  But again here too the pool was too crowded with people...    Again in breakfast we had to wait for 15 to 20 mins to even enter the restaurant because of over crowd....  Hotels of these size should have a better planning to accommodate all guest for bfast   Anyways I will recommend this only for roof top pool view and just for bragging rights of saying that we stayed at marina bay sands  ",3
Room is ordinary just like any other 5 star hotel rooms. Nothing really that special. There are some rooms that faces the garden by the bay this view is very beautiful. The best facility is the swimming located at the top of the hotel. Offers immaculate views from up there  ,4
"MBS is the luxury shopping mall in singapore. There is one stop entertainment place, you can find hingly branded store, restourant, cinema, hotel, swimingpool, iceskating area, casino, and many more. You also can find the infinite pool on tje roof top.",4
"Check-in staff were helpful and friendly, my only complaint was the check-in queue. Would be great if there was a resting place while waiting. The rooms were not extraordinary although the bed was really comfortable for solo traveller like me. The architecture and aesthetics of the hotel is extremely stunning and impressive, although the layout of the hotel meant that it can be confusing at times. However, everyone who stays here must go to the pool on the roof. Fantastic view of the city skyline, excellent atmosphere but overcrowded as it seemed like all the guests are at the pool. The situation is worsened in the evening during sunset where it can be pretty difficult to move around, much less swim in the pool. The gantries to the pool seems to be pretty useless but staff are…",5
"Iconic hotel in the Heart of downtown of Singapore, a bit pricy but worthy going for at least one night to get access to Infinity pool with priceless view over the city. However for such price breakfast should be incl I believe. Weightlifting section in the gym is tiny for such a huge hotel. Elevators are confused: u may go half way down, be stopped and go back up again coz someone had summoned the lift ",4
Went for business and stayed here. Big hotel connected to a mall (which is useful when you forget clothes or want to have a business dinner at Din Tai Fung or Pizzeria Mozza). The rooftop pool is a global landmark but does get busy.,4
"What an amazing hotel, shaped like a boat on three giant pillars dominating the harbor with a gourmet restaurant, trendy bar and infinity pool on the roof of the 53 story hotel. Service was excellent, I paid for a sea view room and the sea was some distance from the hotel so even in our 30th floor sand suite we could not see the sea. I felt a bit cheeky as the sea in Singapore is full of tankers and not very picturesque but I went to tell reception and the hotel gave me an orchid suite much higher up which was bigger than most 3 bed houses very pleased. The rooftop pool area gets very busy as it is open to the public too but it is still definitely worth a visit anyway for the views of singapore and afternoon tea is thrown in with your room so you can still sit in a peaceful…",5
The Marina bay towers have a restaurant/bar - if you can get in I would recommend it. Beware there is a dress code.  the bar is definitely pricey but you would pay for a drink vs. an entry fee for the deck. The views are definitely worth it and I would recommend going at night!,4
"We were passing by Singapore in our honeymoon and decided to spend a night in MBS.   We arrived late at night, during check in we were promptly assigned our room by an efficient albeit a tad abrupt agent. Our room was beautiful with modern styling. Unfortunately everything went south from there. We decided to go up to the sky park to see the famous MBS pool where a hotel staff member rudely told us pool access was closed, after we saw other guests walk into the pool area, we insisted and now more rudely the staff member turned us away almost pushing us. We informed the agents in the lobby who offered an apology and promised to look into the matter.  Having only one day in Singapore we decided to do an early check out, leave the bags with the concierge and see some of the city.…",2
It's everything you could wish for and more! Our room was amazing and overlooked the Singapore flyer. The staff were lovely and helpful. The best part was of course the infinity pool. Absolutely breath taking!!! Their restaurant buffet has incredible choice and all tasted delicious. They also have a huge casino underground which is worth a visit.  I would return here in the morning if I could!!!,5
"Stunning hotel in design, but lacking in comfort if you are not in a Club room. Club room was lovely. Apart from an early morning swim (you cannot have a good swim later as it is so crowded) Everyone taking photos of each other or kids screaming and playing around) It would be a good idea to have a kids and adults only pool in one of the larger pools.  There is a separate kiddies pool, but they like to join their parents!  Pool bar attendants continually ask, 'Can I get you a drink or any food?' I appreciate they want to sell, but it became wearing!  Not a lot to do that does not cost! On our first night we went to a restaurant in The Shoppes called Yu Cuisine. Expensive for what we ate. Hotel has its own underground train station, which is part of the Singapore system. Visit…",4
"Service was good, room was clean and location is absolutely perfect! We got a nice surprise in our room, a birthday cake! Infinity pool was perfect! Our room included free entrance to the club, where we had really good food, drinks and breakfast.",5
"The rooms at MBS are over rated. The rating I have given is for the pool. The infinity pool is to die for. The view from the top is amazing and the pool looks beautiful during the day and late evenings. The jacuzzis are well thought of as well. The buffet breakfast was decent, there are better buffets available around.",5
"We stayed at a King suite on the 45th floor overlooking the Singapore Strait, Filled with brilliant views of the Gardens by the Bay and the harbour. Sunrise was pure radiance from our room. The breakfast served here is the most extensive menu we've had for breakfast in any hotel. The breakfast menu is a treat to anyone ranging from food from all over Asia to continental style breakfast. The rooms are huge and has brilliant decor. It is needless to say, visit the infinity pool on the 56th floor!",5
We treated ourselves to a two night stay here on the way home. It certainly is one of the most memorable places to stay in the world for the right reasons. We had a room with an amazing view over Gardens by the Bay and the Straits (arguably better than the city view option). Very spacious with all the essentials supplied. The highlight was certainly exclusive access to the Infinity Pool and the roof garden (note: one room key required for each guest). Fortunately we had a rare break in the bad hazy weather afflicting Singapore at the time. The hotel is close to the city with a choice of two MRT (metro) stations nearby. There is a good Hawkers food hall in the adjoining shopping mall. ,5
"Considering the amount of rooms spread in the three towers, the quality of the service in general and the attention to details are remarquable, in line with Asian standards. This hotel, especially when you consider the mall and the casino next door, part of the complex, is a city in itself! The views are impressive, either on the city, the bay and the river or overlooking the garden on the other side. It's an deal way to see how Singapore is spreading and quickly changing visit after visit... The infiniti pool undoubtedly is worth a visit... more for the stunning view and the feeling of refreshing in the water whilst being so high in the air. However, the pool is clearly not meant to be a swimming destination, as it is rather crowded with people taking pictures of themselves, no…",3
"Have previously stayed and enjoyed it, however recently made a booking for my family members who are travelling this weekend for a special occasion (honeymoon). The service is very impersonal and the phone attendant was not interested in helping me confirm details/ ensure their stay is special",2
"room is great, and our room have a nice view of Garden by the bay  Suites room have a sofa bed that can be turned into a double bed without any additional cost.  Club access give access to lvl 55 club and while the selection is not much but the view and staff service there really could made your day  minor thing is that they will charge 4sgd for each additional bottled water. It should be free given the price of the room",4
"With very high hopes given all the reviews and hype - I must say, rather disappointing. Sure the hardware is great, but the software, the maintenance - not exactly what I would call tip top. Staff were begrudgingly attentive and hotel room - well, seen one seen them all. Let's just say, I wasn't particularly impressed, nothing really blew me away. There were SO MANY PEOPLE staying there, that everything was a bit troubling, noisy and just not as enjoyable - especially at these prices.",3
"From the 5-9th February, 2016 my wife and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, well what an experience, the room wee had on the 46th floor overlooked the gardens and each night seeing the light show was amazing. It is centrally located for bus,rail and taxi services. The staff especially in Club 55 and at the infinity pool were outstanding. So if you just want to relax, sight see and feel important then stay at the Marina Bay Sands.",5
"Stayed 2 nights for business conference. This amazing looking hotel's highlight is the pool at the top. It is big and great view of the city.   It is conveniently connected to a huge luxury shopping mall and conference rooms as well as Casino. There is also a well designed botanical garden nearby.   This is a luxury hotel indeed. If you want to enjoy cheaper / local fun side of Singapore, then it would not be a good idea as it is far from the city center and everything around this hotel is designed to be luxury and expensive.   Personally, it is a bit too much commercialized ( not much local personality)",4
"Lsst time I stayed ere I stayed in a suite and was really impressed with the room and the service.  This time I did not realize it but I just booked a club room.  The room was great on the 47th floor overlooking the gardens and water.  It had a balcony to watch the ships and distant planes landing at the airport.  The bathroom was large and had everything you need.  I particularly liked the large soaking tub.  I had my request likes when I wanted my turn down service and for foam pillows and they accommodated me immediately.  There is free wifi.  Club guest get free breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés.  The restaurant which serves these are on the 55th floor and have view of both the city and gardens.  They were very kind and remembered me from my last stay. …",5
"The hotel location and view is great. We spent one night there, the top swimming pool is crowded but really fancy. The room is big and comfortable. We ordered room service and taste good. Service is wonderful.",4
"The hotel itself is an iconic venue which is definately a must when visiting Singapore. However, we felt it was just a tick on the bucket list rather than actually enjoying the stay at the hotel itself.   We found the arrival process quite overwhelming as the hotel lobby is packed with tourists and hotel guests and we were quickly ushered to a queue to check in with no real personal touch. After an 8 hour flight this was not quite the welcome we are accustomed to in other hotels we have stayed in. In terms of the room it was very spacious, however, the shower smelt mouldy and damp.  There is no doubt about it that the pool and the views from the hotel are amazing however having now ticked this off our list and getting the standard pool photo, we would not stay here again when we…",3
"check in was  very busy but did not take to long  the desk was very helpfull the room was fantastic everything you need,i rang room service for some ice it was at our door in three minutes the food in the restaurants was very good and the service was just as good, the pool well the view is out of this world  could not believe you can use the tv to check out  took just seconds WE WILL GO BACK",5
"Lived in Singapore for a long time but first time staying at MBS. It is well worth the money I would say. The highlight of the entire stay is of course the Infinity Pool (we were lucky to find some less-crowded time to enjoy the water & the view); Super friendly staff (they made towels in the shape of love swans and spread rose petals on the bed for us without asking, just by noticing the champagne we brought in hehe). Overall we were very happy about this stay, and will definitely come back next time!",5
This is an amazing hotel and huge.   We had a room overlooking the harbour and out to the city on the 29th floor and the view was great and the room lovely   The pool is fantastic but as many reviewers have said it is busy but we still got a lounger and had a lovely swim with the city in the background   Breakfast was good and had a huge selection we did have an incident in the first day when we had breakfast when we came back from getting some more food the entire table had been cleared but it was quickly set up again omelettes were good and the pastrami was amazing the other hit dishes weren't very hot but food was replenished often and sweet stuff was great   We had dinner in the bar area overlooking reception which was nice then Chinese the next night   Staff were attentive…,4
"I had hesitated over the expense of a night at Marina Bay Sands, but staying here was such a lovely experience that I would have no doubts about booking again.   On checking in we were delighted to be given a free upgrade to a suite which was wonderfully over the top with a lounge, dining area, bedroom, balcony, bathroom and a second toilet. We didn't know what to do with all the space!  The balcony offered a great vantage point to watch the light show in the Gardens by the Bay. However, the highlight was the pool - such a lovely escape from the heat and humidity.   A swim in the pool at sunrise was the perfect way to start the day before a fantastic buffet breakfast at 'Rise' restaurant with an incredible variety of Asian dishes (quite probably the best breakfast I have eaten…",5
"There's already plenty here about the rooms and pool, so I will just add that indoor I wouldn't know if I was in Vegas or Singapore. Like Vegas, the property leans toward spectacle and shopping. The casino has two levels with the upper level non-smoking only. The rainforest gardens are lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed my trip here. ",5
"I will make this short and to the point! This is a Must Stay!   Infinity Pool is rated one of the Top 10 in the World. The view is amazing and it will not disappoint you. That said drinks are very very expensive and you are paying for the view along with them. Location is great, across the street from a Luxury Mall and Casino. Subway access is through the mall and you can get almost anywhere in the City from it. Beautiful City, lots to do and great shopping and markets. If you have a chance to go do not pass it up! Other must do's if staying here... Botanical Gardens.",5
"I would like to share a lovely experience at Marina Bay Sands. It was my parents' 25th anniversary. We decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands on 2nd February 2016.  We had booked 2 deluxe rooms( the most basic). On reaching there, when I informed the receptionist - Ian , about the occasion and asked him for upgrade( just a better room at a higher floor), what came our way was the best I could ever expect. We were given the Presidential Suite at Tower 1 on the 54th floor, overlooking the bay. The description of the suite is beyond words - the most beautiful and the biggest room( way way beyond our budget) at the best hotel in Singapore. Thank you Marina Bay Sands for such a gesture and hospitality. No doubt your customers feel so happy and satisfied, on their stay there, because of…",5
"We had the most amazing time being looked after by the impeccable and intelligent staff. Having travelled the world extensively, The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is without hesitation the best hotel in the country - perhaps Asia. Lydia runs an amazing team of staff - she is always smiling, always attentive and very very kind and fun to be with. Joseph and Jacob were amazing friends and really we saw them as family. They embody the spirit of Singapore and the heart of the Marina Bay ethic when treating their guests.",5
"Excellent hotel!! We were a bit worried that we chose this hotel for the first night in Singapore after 11 h flight. But when we saw rooms and, of course, infinity pool - we were amazed. Relaxing on the top of the roof, enjoying warm pool water, watching sundown and drinking cocktail - that feeling was priceless. ",5
"We had the most wonderful time spending new years vacation here. Room was more on the average side, but it was big and had a nice view of  Gardens by The Bay.   For shopping and eating we could just head downstairs for the Shoppes, with its abundance of choices.   Head upstairs to the rooftop, you'll find the most EPIC infinity pool and the slickest bar lounge ever. The view is of course sick.   Very pricey but overall satisfactory. ",5
"I spend a day in Marina baysands hotel. It was too hard to book because this hotel was very famous and popular. So I changed my schedule for staying this hotel. The swimming pool was great, but there's too many people. So I couldn't swimming. Also it was very hard to take a sunbed. But I want to stay this hotel if I go back to Singapore. The view was great and the shopping mall was very fascinating. ",5
"Very nice hotel, but very crowded especially with Mainland Chinese. The infinity pool was awesome, BUT note that young kids with armbands or floats are only allowed allowed at the corner with glass shields and that area was rather small and crowded. Room was a bit small for the price paid. Helpful and friendly and efficient staff.",4
"This is one of the best hotels of Singapore. It has an amazing pool view as the pool is located on 57th floor. I got a room on 4th floor, the room was nice and big. the check-in line is big as the hotel is huge with 3 different towers and check in counter at each tower. The negative point is the check in time is at 3pm which is too late and check out is at 11am which is too early. the main thing the mini bar u can't touch that as if u open the bar and if by mistake one of the product is moved a bit also from its place you will be charged automatically by its computerized billing and you need to pay it if you consume it or no. So i would suggest don't touch the minibar. Now the food it is nice lots of choices for vegetarians and main thing you get Jain food here. If you have…",4
"I went there with my husband for a drink at a bar on the rooftop. My husband ordered a beer while I ordered a cocktail and calamari. The cocktail wasn't nice at all and I was quite disappointed... After awhile, I felt something was on my hand and after a second I realised it was a huge cockroach (it was very dark there so I couldn't really see!). I screamed and the staff there saw this, no one apologise nor do anything though... (I know it's not their fault but since it happened at their bar, at least they could have offered something like wet tissue paper for me to clean my hand etc). I went straight to the toilet to wash my hand... After that, the calamari came but I didn't want to stay there anymore so I didn't finish my drink and food (anyway my drink wasn't nice so it's…",1

"My Wife & I flew to Singapore to pick up a cruise for two weeks we decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for 3 Days, we were very impressed with the check-in al thou busy it was prompt and efficient, our room was overlooking the Bay facing the city and had a good view of the laser light show every evening. Our room was spacious modern clean & tidy, with excellent room service. We eat two evenings at the Rise Restaurant as the food was so good with a fantastic range to meet any ones taste.  We experienced Sunrise & Sunset in the Infinity Pool and was so impressed, we will definitely be back and recommend this as a must to any visitor to Singapore.",5
Can't fault this iconic hotel. The hotel is outstanding in everything it does. We received a complimentary upgrade upon check in and given extended check out after explaining that our transfer to changi airport was after 5pm. The infinity pool is just amazing. The views breathtaking from the balcony and the rooms fantastic. Thank you Marina Bay Sands for a truly memorable stay.,5
"My husband and I spent 4 nights in Marina Bay Sands in early December 2015. Although our room had been upgraded to a Marina Bay wiev it was very noisy due to construction works from 8am in the morning in the Marina Bay and every night the music from Winterland gardens was going on to 5 am. Also ridiculous prices of drinks and escorts allowed in Sky bar and all hotel areas. Not very impressed.   No clear indication of Reception desk Tower 3 it looks more like shopping centre then hotel lobby No information by the check in about the butlers service or how to get to the 50ft floor room , there are 2 different lifts, no bath/ shower room choice. The Sky infinitive pool is the best facility of the resort and we really enjoyed time spent there in adults only area. By the check-out…",3
"Depending on which side you are facing, you will get to see the beautiful Singapore Skyscrapers or Gardens by the Bay + National Stadium + the sea from as high as 40+ floors. We stayed on the 15th floor, facing the Gardens/sea, and the view was truly magnificent! This, coupled with cozy interiors, soft and warm bed and pillows, and a balcony, truly made our stay one not to forget.",5
"My family visit this hotel in August 2014, we stay for 2 nights. Our first impression of this hotel is amazed with the luxuries of the place. The lobby height is very tall full of modern artistic ornament. We got room in 47th floor (If I'm not mistake), from this height we can see view of Garden by the bay and Singapore flyer. For you with kids please to watch your kid if they playing in balcony due to there were no safety and the balcony wall is not to tall so its quite dangerous if kids climbing the balcony.  First thing we do after arrived is to go to the Marina Bay Sands icon the pool deck, with its position located on the top of the hotel you can see Singapore with its best view. Me and the kids busy to take selfie in the tip of the pool.   Food in this hotel is great, with…",4
we reach singapore in the middle of January and i was planning to stay at marina bay sands because i was remembering when their was building it the infinity pool is spectacular and also the buffet in the lobby at lunch was very good remember that you are staing in a 5 star hotel that is an attraction more than hotel so everything is very expensive once in a life worth the amount your spending there hi highly recommend to stay at list 2 night so you can enjoy the pool in the less busy hours,4
"If you're asking me, every trip to Singapore must include at least one night at the Marina Bay Sands. Great facilities, obviously the Infinity pool is amazing... The club members rooms are big and comfortable and the view is simpley irreplaceable!",5
I stayed there only one night but it was worth all money :) . Amazing swimming pool on the roof . So i recomended to everyone to stay there if U will be in Singapur. The room was very big with fantastic view at the city. Just breathless. So dont waste Ur time...,5
"A truly memorable experience. My family stayed here for a week on our return from Bali. We all agreed that our stay at this wonderful hotel was memorable. The staff cannot do enough for the guest. They are polite, friendly and patient. Our room was well equipped and clean. we can find no faults to list. The roof top pool is an experience not to miss. The views are spectacular a full 360 degrees. The food hall in the lower ground floor is very busy and a great place to meet. We found that the themed restaurants are very expensive and not good value for money. All the big designer labels are well represented here too. There is a free light show every evening in the marina outside the hotel and this is a must see. The open top bus rides around Singapore are great value for money…",5
"As we had booked the Orchid Suite at Marina Bay Sands, we had a separate check in desk. The only negative thing about this was that it didn't move fast. The regular line up was moving a lot faster and we waited and waited and waited to be checked in. (We were the only people in the queue too). However, upon getting to the desk, we were told that we had been upgraded to another, larger suite. It was a nice surprise to say the least. There were three of us sharing and we got escorted up (the only way up was a private lift) and shown to our room. It was stunning. I think it was bigger than my whole house to be honest. Two balconies overlooking The Gardens in the Bay, big Jacuzzi bath, walk in wardrobe, shower room, big bedroom, enormous living area and a pool table area. I mean…",5
Impressive building with amazing view of Singapore. It's a great pleasure to have glass of wine during sunset at the rooftop bar. Their infinity pool is only for guests -unfortunately-. Must for anyone who is visiting Singapore.,5
Stayed here during our short stay in S'pore last year. Mind blown by the excellent service and the quality of stay. Real value for money considering the activities and facilities that are provided. Surely visiting this place again!,5
"It's hard to describe the enormity of this hotel with its 2500 rooms and fantastic facilities, including theatres and shopping centre. But what sets this apart from others is its ability to deliver fantastic personal service using staff that really care. The food is excellent after day 1 the staff in 55 remembered and used our names, they anticipated our every need. Room service delivered in its own mobile oven so it's piping hot and always on time. The lady in the gym who gives us water a towel and opens the door on exit. Truly a fantastic experience with breathtaking views.",5
"We spent two nights here mainly for the pool and the hype. The rooms are lovely, the pool view is beautiful, but honestly this is what you're paying for, at a hefty price.   No breakfast included, had to pay to get a fridge delivered! and I was disappointed at the lack of late night food options, considering the size of the place.   Overall I felt the hotel was too big and quite impersonal. Also it's overpriced. we wanted the experience of the roof top pool, but we'd not return to this hotel.",3
"Okay I am going to be honest, this hotel is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced!! the only thing amazing about this place is the rooftop pool which is beautiful to take pictures in- its stunning!!!  our room wasnt the greatest, it was average. But our washroom was pretty luxurious. The hotel is huge, it has 3 towers and everything is walking distance such as gardens by the bay which is BEAUTIFUL and at night they light up and has a show- so pretty! so we were happy, only stayed one day here and i suggest one day only since is so pricey and you get the experience anyways:)",4
Marina bay sands is an icon and we simply loved it. Stayed there for four nights and loved every single one of them. It's a grand hotel and our deluxe suite was just incredible with beautiful sea views. Will highly recommend Atleast once in a life time.,5
"Great place to stay, surprisingly good value. Very helpful staff, great location and facilities. Took taxi from airport only about £12 Great bar and food on poolside, also best place for breakfast. Watching the sun come up while sitting in jacuzzi is a great start to the day",5
"Worth visiting. Nothing can be bad about Marina Bay Sand. It's was a great experience. I stayed there for two days, everything was superb.  The view was great from the top even from our balcony. Food was great, even the staff were so well behaved.  ",5
"Is like a big Mall..... lot of restaurant,shops and other but no service for the hotel customers. The pool is the only reason to visit the hotel. I have been there during the f1 gp and pool was closed during the race.",3
"This was a treat for ourselves before the long trip back to New Zealand. We stayed two nights and it was worth every penny. WHAT A VIEW! we had a room on the 42nd floor overlooking the gardens which i describe as something out of the movie Avatar! The staff were amazing, food options are many and varied so you are bound to find something to suit budget and style. The pool is fabulous service amazing and facilities just right. Bed was comfortable as were the pillows. Id put it on your bucket list and make sure you go to the gardens, at night they are lit up like a wonderland. Wow this would be one of my favourites!",5
"large room, city view at floor 46 great view day time and night time fast check in at tower 3 very nice staff infinity pool at floor 57 with night club ce la vi The place to be in Singapore fantastic experience",5
"I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Singapore and if there's this hotel that I will recommend that is Marina Bay Sands, Aside from  a breathtaking scenery they also serve their clients with a world class service.",5
"Don't get me wrong this hotel is beautiful, it is in a good spot and has an amazing pool but really for what you pay I would have preferred to stay somewhere else like pan pacific or ritz.   It's not really suited for kids either because swimming to have fun with mountains of adults taking selfies in the pool didn't feel appropriate. Very busy hotel for kids, we were on level 3 in tower 3 and the noise from the road was too much at times while trying to sleep with a child.    The worst part was how slippery the pool deck was. I was lucky that a friend warned me before we went because she fell over while there so I took extra caution with my child and still managed to nearly slip on at least three occasions.  Another negative is how loud the club is that you have to walk past to…",3
"Probably because it was during the Chinese New Year period the check-in counter queue was very long and waited up to 30 mins.  The staffs were very patience and apologise to us and gave us a upgrade of room! Though this was really out of our expectations. Views of the room was spectacular able to see the night view of Singapore skyline.  Breakfast was up to expectations and services as well. Stayed here for about 6 nights and travelling to other places was easy since MRT is just nearby.  But one thing that was worth was the infinity pool that it's what makes it famous.   Overall, quite satisfied with the stay and services of the staffs regardless of check-in or front desk. It's worth staying if you're coming to Singapore! Highly recommended! ",4
It was a nice experience to stay in marina bay sands. The staff are polite and quickly respond to our needs. The view from the pool is amazing. I WILL choose marina bay sands again when I  visiting Singapore.,5
"my stay has been one of the worst in Asia. the hotel is more a factory than a 5* hotel. i went to the pool, there were millions of tourists trying to take selfies, a lot of noise, not relaxing at all. the pool is nice, but not woth a stay at the hotel. hotel decoration is below Singapore average. it was extremely noisy, with people very drunk lying in the hotel corridors....couldnt sleep the whole night.",1
stayed for 4 nights in tower C on a official event.  First things first. SGD 436/per night is way to high considering the amenities they offered. I stayed in fairmont in Nov 2015 and at SG400 it was way more luxurious than MBS.  Pros: 1) rooms are spacious 2) MRT right beneath the hotel. Direct connection to Little India and Dhoby Ghaut . 3) casino downstairs. 4) Shopping centre right across the road with access through the hotel itself. But mainly high end luxury brands. 5) Walking distance to garden by the Bay 6) perfect place to catch laser show on the promenade of shopping complex. 7) CelaVi is one of the most happening pubs on the 57th floor of the Tower C 8) View from infinity pool is amazing. 9) facility for shower and spa in case of late evening/night flight.  Cons: 1)…,3
"While traveling to Sri Lanka from Chengdu China. My daughter and I spent one day here. Our flight arrived ver early in the morning, but the staff welcomed us right in. Even let us check in very early. We spend most of the time at the hotel. Club room, which included a great break fast and snack and drinks from 5-7. The staff was ALWAYS friendly and most remembered my name with just one introduction. Yes, this is not an inexpensive place to stay. It will cost you a few $$$ to stay. But the hotel made me feel welcome, and warmed. Thank you!",5
"We stayed two nights at MBS the weekend of Chinese New Year.  The hotel itself is beautiful and our stay rates a strong 4-star.  A few issues prevented this from being a 5-star experience.  First, checking in was chaotic.  The lobby area was extremely crowded and the line to check in was very long.  It took a very long time to take care of each guest.  The worst part was that individual staff members at the front desk would leave his/her station, wave guests off, leaving fewer beleaguered staff members to take care of a growing line.  I saw them wave away a little boy who had been waiting with his mother for a very long time simply because the boy and his mother wasn't at a VIP line.  Nothing is more frustrating than to see individuals staff members standing around not helping…",4
I stayed for 5 days.It was a magic stay in Singapore in a magic hotel.As my title describes it's a very impressive hotel.And the most impressive thing in the hotel is the swimming pool and the view which is joined.Excellent service great hotel good quality of facilities but one thing was negative.The drinks and the food in the hotel are very expensive while the stay is not cheap.I think they have to something about that.Better prices for the guests of the hotel.,5
"Hard to write a review without repeating most of what has already been said... But this is a hotel you have to try at least once, if only for its mind gobbling infinity pool with an incredible view over Singapore and enjoy the drinks in the bar Kudeta.",4
"the last visit was few years ago during chinese new year, which was disastrous. therefore, didn't expect a lot during this visit as i believe nothing could be worse than last time. came here purely because my husband wanted to visit the sky pool.   we arrived the hotel very early in the morning, around 7am. The check-in staff offered us to check-in already at that hour, extremely friendly. She also upgraded us to another higher category room, which was out of our expectations. although we have stayed there only for a night, the overall impression changed. yet, the poor experience is still on my mind.   the bathroom design is again, not built/designed in the most practical way - either for customers or staff. before flushing the toilet, you have to put down the seat cover. the…",4
Loved going here for a drink and watching the sun set whilst sipping on a cocktail.  No where to sit unless you are dining...that's a downfall...some high stools at the tables would be useful.  Great view.,4
"Checkin took a long time because too many people checked in, but the receptionist was a professional, he apologized to us and tried to do his best to get a room as soon as possible. We booked luxury double bed room and got upgrade to orchid suite! Which cost more than two time more :D pool is great but its overcrouded, and at 11p.m its closed until 6 a.m. We woke up at 6 and it was a great because just a few people were there, so when u want to have nice pics without too many people i advise to use it early at the morning. ",4
"We stayed on the 44th floor. Sea view. Spotless room. The bathroom was absolutely perfect with stand alone bathtub and separate self-contained shower. In-room amenities were great, they do not provide a massive selection of toiletries so gentlemen dont forget your razors!  * Biggest negative first: check in is quite long and they really get you if you dont use credit card... so make sure you dont forget your credit card if you visit this hotel because what they will do is take a deposit (not a small one either) which you will get back within two week, and well, wealthy or not, its your money sitting in your hands when chances are you will leave the room spotless. *The biggest positive!  Breakfast is simply one of the biggest buffets I have been to (safe to say I have been to…",5
"MBS has truly become a money grab machine that severely tarnishes its reputation as a world class destination.  After reserving a $1000 club room we were told at checkin that our 11yr old son would cost $175 to have access to pool & lounge. 30 min later the mgr. agreed to include.  After an hour at the packed pool we ventured to the pool bar area to grab a table and drink to relax where we were told the only available table was $300, no thanks.  Then at 5pm it was off to the lounge for happy hour but come to find out they had sold the fab roof top location to Spago and now the lounge shares half of the health club location. Nice profit for hotel with no thought for their guests.  Save your money and stay at the ShangriLa on Sentosa and go to MBS for a drink. ",1
"One of the best hotels I have ever seen. Every detail is notices, huge rooms, big shower, clean and well maintained. Staff members in every corner so you dont have to do much but relax and enjoy. Coffee and food in the small Cafe, ground floor next to buildind 3 is really good and of course the proximity to the huje casino!",5
"Without a doubt one of the best hotel experiences during all my travels. My expectations of Marina Bay Sands was quite high prior to my visit, so i was picturing the very best in my mind before we even arrived. The place delivered beyond my expectations, it was absolutely stunning, from the initial entrance to the rooftop infinity pool. Staff were friendly, rooms were clean and well furnished. We stayed here during new year so prices were quite high, almost $900AU per night for the two of us, but i can definitely say it was worth the experience. Add it to the bucket list if you haven't already!",5
"First off,  it is a beautiful hotel with beautiful views.  On the other hand,  the cost of a room is certainly not worth it. The benefits of buying a room for a night are pretty much the same as if you were to visit for free, or went to any above average hotel.  Nothing extra in the rooms, that you couldn't get for a fourth the cost nearby.   Simply visit,  go to the roof (must buy a drink which are about $20) enjoy the view,  then your done. The rest is simply shopping and a casino,  all of which are free to visit as well for foreigners. Also lots of parabens and preservatives in the shampoos and soaps,  which at this price point is very disappointing. ",3
"Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful hotel with great views from the top. I loved the infinity pool and the casino, in general an amazing hotel. The only let down was that the hotel is expensive and everything feels very mechanical, with so many people and so many rooms you feel like there is no personal service, i loved the hotel though and recommend visiting it even if your not staying there.",4
"I really enjoyed the stay at the hotel. The reception is a bit busy and crowded.  The room was nice with great views and a wonderful bathtube and the swimming pool was also nice (I was expecting more, though)   The only problem is that the pool is absolutely full of kids and full of disrespectful Asian tourists (i dont know where they were from but they should learn some manners, I know not all are like that but a lot were) I have nothing against  children but it is impossible to enjoy with them (and their terrible parents because those are the problem, not responsible at all.) splashing around and Screaming. I got kicked twice by different people (and they didnt even say sorry but laughed at me, both, kid and parent when I complaint), so be careful and try to avoid areas with…",3
This hotel actually has a character of its own - marvelous architecture with three curved towers joined at the top with a 57th floor infinity pool ! In the background is Singapore's financial district. Complete with a shopping centre & Michelin star chef restuarants . Chef Justin Quek's restaurant 'Sky on 57' was amazing with an elaborate breakfast buffet spread. i digged the Egg benedicts with smoked Salmon :)   Overall very good location & good service.,5
We stayed here after our honeymoon cruise from dubai. Prior to our honeymoon my husband asked marina bay for early check in as we docked early morning. This hadn't happened so we were told that check in would be later in in the day. Luckily for us a room became available early. The foyer feels.like a train station but don't be fooled the rooms are to die for.  We.overlooked the sky park and wow what a view we had. We had a huge balcony but the only thing .missing was possibly a table and chairs to sit but that wasn't a problem for us. At night the sky park was lit up and views were wonderful.  The room was superb. The bed so soft and of a good quality. We had a huge bathroom divided into 3 parts. A roll top bath and shower. 2 sinks with good quality toiletries and a separate loo…,4
"I couldn’t fault our stay here it was brilliant. We stayed here specifically to use the infinity pool, which didn’t disappoint. It was a little busy for my liking, but that’s not the hotels fault and is to be expected, however with some trial and error we found the best times to go swimming and enjoyed ourselves. Also the pool has an adult only section which was excellent. The views were fabulous, particularly at night when gardens by the bay are illuminated. The room was comfortable and housekeeping did an excellent job. I was skeptical when people compared it to a Vegas hotel however it really does have that feel, especially the size of the shopping centre. Although I found the casino to have more of a serious feel to it, possibly because alcohol didn’t seem to be as readily…",5
"I like this roof top pool on this hotel! It is very famous but it is not so crowded. But some time so windy :) It's really big hotel. so you can enjoy everything to easy. Many restaurant, Casino, brand shop.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel...probably one of its kind in APAC...for its glamour, size and options....  Located between the Gardens by the bay on one side and the waterfront on the other, this hotel cum shopping galleria cum convention center is a phenomenon by itself...  The 57th floor restaurant cum pool is a once in a lifetime experience...and offers breathtaking views...",5
"You sell your hotel as a luxury experience and it is far from it.  We didn't get any assistance when getting out of the taxi when we arrived. No one even opened up the door for us and you don't even have full automatic doors, so when carrying bags, kids, prams your hands are not free to open the heavy door.  There is a queue for everything, to access breakfast, to take the lift, to enter the pool. Is this a hotel or a theme park?   People were having breakfast wearing the hotel bath robe, what is that? that takes out any status or any elegance and class from your hotel so set up a dress code if you really want to show the image that you sell and promise on your website.  I have stayed at other five stars hotels in Singapore and they offer exceptional service  When you are in the…",1
"I love this hotel - especially the pool. We stayed here 1 night as part of our honeymoon. We were kindly upgraded which was a bonus! The hotel room had everything we needed, but we really only stayed for the pool. It's open from 6am - 10pm. The hotel is very close to the casino and transit stop. The only down side to the hotel is it's not near any supermarkets / shops ect. Definitely stay here for a short stay.",5
"Beautiful, huge room. Stunning view. Very impressive building.Great pool (bit cold though).  But for $500 a night it was disappointing in some respects.  We arrived after a long flight, struggled with our bags - absolutely no concierge help whatsoever - either getting out of the taxi, struggling through the hotel doors or getting to check-in. This set a very bad impression - $500 a night and not even help with our bags?!!  The hotel is very busy - I think so busy that it's impersonal. I left feeling that we'd stayed at at a city apartment - albeit a luxurious one.  I'm glad we stayed but I wouldn't go back - instead of being a luxurious stay with great service, it felt like we were visiting a tourist attraction.",3
"I stayed for two nights at the hotel while my husband attended a conference which was also run at the hotel.  The room was lovely, very spacious with views over Gardens by the Bay and the surrounding bay area.  Check-in was efficient and housekeeping during our stay was perfect.  While there was really nothing that I can fault, the sheer size of the hotel and the way it is set up within various shopping malls makes it feel rather artificial and impersonal.  The rooftop pool is breathtaking but the fact that it is very crowded and full of people taking selfies makes it feel like a zoo, rather than the cool place I imagined it to be.  I visited it twice, once late afternoon and then again on my last morning.  Both times I would not describe the ambiance as relaxing.  Overall I…",4
I stayed in MBS last Nov and was deeply disappointed by the overall hotel experience.   Pros: -Check in was easy and lobby service was sub-par -Rooms were a good size with a view of the city  Cons: -toilet and surround area was disturbingly dirty -signs of age in the furniture (did not expect this from a 5*) -was not allowed in the pool area due to capacity issues? Absolutely ruined my trip because I was looking forward to the infinity pool and did not get a chance to use it.   I’m back in Singapore next week and  I’d honestly like to give MBS another try…but I have chosen the Ritz Carlton instead where they value me as a Marriot elite member.,2
We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The room is extremely spacious and beautiful. Our room was on 47th floor with spectacular view on the gardens. The infinity pool was breathtaking! It's something you have to experience when in Singapore. It's unforgettable! It was funny to see young people constantly taking their selfies. No one was really swimming there.,5
"We stopped over at Singapore and stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a night. When we checked in, the room was not ready so we went to the roof top bar to have a drink. When we tried to put the bill to our room, the waitress said the room number on our card was incorrect and my husband was not happy due to the long flight and the heat. We went down to the reception and asked about our room. It turned out they have upgraded us to a suite with pool table inside! It is the most spacious suite we have ever stayed in. We spent the rest of the afternoon soaking in the roof top pool. We loved the kids pool which was less crowded and has comfy daybeds right next to it. We also loved the shopping centre where I can get snacks for my kids from the convenient store. It is much more functional…",5
"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for one night in November 2015 (because it is so damn expensive).  I requested to be in Tower 2 (out of the three towers that they had) due to it's location as it is accessible to the infinity pool (which is a MUST see), the casino, shops and entrance where the taxi bay is.  Upon arriving, the line to check in was rather long and I had to wait at least 10 minutes to check in although the high ceiling, cleanliness and warming atmosphere almost made up for it (also noting that they had all hands on deck!) Upon checking in, the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The bell man also takes your luggage to your room so I was not burdened with wheeling around my luggage which was very convenient.  My room was amazing, the staff was very helpful and…",5
"So, anyone who sees the iconic photos of this hotel has to wonder if this is the right place to stay and if it's worth the price. While it is indeed at the VERY top end of my personal budget, I absolutely had to do it if for no other reason than to swim in that insane pool...worth it! The room was stunning with an unbelievable floor-to-ceiling view of the bay through our automatic-opening curtains. Luxurious shower. Incredible service. Robes, towels, sound, pillows, plugs....all met or exceeded expectations. We were treated like they really wanted us to be there and enjoy ourselves.  If I had to come up with a con, I'd say that the elevators were hot and the crowds on the lobby level could be a little overwhelming.  Spoil yourself! You've earned it!",5
"I've stayed here 4 times. The previous time before this was 2 or 3 years back. I think the management then was better. Now I feel that it is stingy and not classy. Too many China tourists if that can't be helped. Feels like a zoo. If you want some peace and quiet, opt for another hotel.   The price of the hotel is exorbitant. I will never pay full price to stay in this hotel because it is a rip off. It doesn't come with breakfast and you have to pay extra 4 dollars for a bottle of drinking water. I enjoyed my stay the last time because it was still new and the gym was luxurious. Now it is just sad, an overpriced hotel catered for the China market. The customer service doesn't feel 5 star. I still felt like I made a mistake this round booking MBS.  If you haven't stayed here…",3
"I tried MBS for a staycation since it is one of the iconic hotels in Singapore. My room was facing the highway and frankly, it is not breathtaking. There are just too many construction all around.   Nonetheless, the service and quality of the amenities have been really commendable. From the lady at the concierge to the bell boy that assisted me all the way to my room, they were really professional and sincere in their service. The bed is really one of the best.   The only reason why I didnt give it a 5 star is because of its pricing. For the price I paid, (APX $400 for a room per night) there are just better ones in Singapore.",4
"My wife and I visited Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel on the first leg of our Asian honeymoon trip. The hotel was easily one of the best hotels we've ever been to. The staff were lovely and super-helpful, the room was fantastic. I'm not usually a fan of modern building, however, in a modern city, you cannot help but to appreciate the beauty of this building and surroundings.   The poolside area is breathtaking and food/drink really nice - a bit on the expensive side, but it's reasonably expensive across Singapore for food and drink.   I would recommend this hotel to anyone and certainly recommend that everyone visits Singapore!",5
"Spent one night here as a birthday present to my sister in law and it was everything i'd hoped it would be.  We stayed in a city view room which was spectacular, large, clean and the bathroom - WOW! Swam upstairs in the evening and found a lounge chair by the pool easily, ordered some cocktails and soaked in the exceptional view, it's a ""I'm speechless"" kinda time up there. Gets a bit chilly after 6 (chilly for Singapore so probably warm everywhere else). If you are able to stay a night, do it, it is very special! ",5
"This place is awesome!! It is Pricey but totally worth it! This hotel is connected to the mall, skywalk, the gardens and the casino.  Of course the infinity pool is amazing with the view of the city so high above it is beautiful. We stayed on the top floor and had a great view of the city a part of me didn't want to leave the room but I know I had to explore lol also the V bar at night has an amazing view of the city they play great music and they close 5am!! ",5
Second time at the hotel the last was a couple of years ago and for business. This time my wife and I spent 3 nights on the way back from a month in Thailand.    The first thing you notice is how crazy busy the reception and entire ground floor is. It's a place to be avoided at all costs if you can. Sanctuary is only a lift ride away. We stayed on the 37th floor with views out to the ocean. Stunning views and the rooms are beautiful with all that you would expect.   An obligatory visit and swim in the pool but its just as busy as reception so after you've had your swim and taken the photos dont hang around if you want peace.   We avoidex the breakfast within the hotel for the same reason as the pool and instead we headed out of the hotel.   Perhaps it was the timing leading into…,4
"It is was a great experience. First of all, we came a bit earlier before check-in time, but we got a room right away and with an upgrade!  The room was very spacious, the bed was extremely comfortable, the view was stunning. About the swimming pool. The best time to go there is about 14-15h, it is pretty quite. We were surprised that at 6.30 in the morning there are quite a few people. Although, around 8.30 they start to leave. And just some heads-up, there are a lot of people in the swimming pool in the evening. We also liked that there two separate swimming pools for families with kids and adults.",5
This Hotel is Huge!! And you will enjoy every bit of it. Had a very quick Check in and an Express Checkout.  Try getting higher floor room and try for the Garden Side view. can enjoy the City side view from the Pool as well but Garden Side view will have the Garden plus the entire Harbor view and it is amazing as  you get a Balcony with the Garden Side View.  Infinity Pool is amazing and as guest you can have unlimited access to it for the entire of your stay. Our Breakfast was included in our stay and it was amazing with some of the best options. It was our Honeymoon trip and the Hotel kept a special surprise for us which was very special. You can easy access to Gardens by Bay and Bay Front MRT station which you can use to travel through the city.  Express Checkout!! Be mindful…,5
"We had a superb room at the 49th floor, with city view.  Spectacular view. The pool is awesome, even a better view over Singapore.  Day time or night time.  Wonderful!  Dinner at the restaurant ""Ce La Vie"" at the 57th floor, best table, city view again. We had the surprise menu. It was a splurge but worth every sing  $$. A must have been Hotel.  ",5
"This hotel is a little like Las Vegas... but I like Las Vegas so it fits me just fine.  A high-energy place with loads of restaurants and bars.  The hotel is huge, but I never felt that the service suffered as a result.  All encounters with the staff were great.  Location is a plus, on top of a subway station, across the street from and connected to the spectacular Gardens and the high-end mall with its nightly laser light show.  The room was very nice, well decorated, and had quality furnishings.  Pool is of course spectacular, and the pool-side food and drinks (both quality and service level) were above average.  Sure it's expensive, but it's worth it due to the quality of the resort and the high service level.",5
"Actually wizhout any additional words - just again and again amazing and breathtaking ... And again I strongly recommend: if you do it, then do it right and DO NOT TRY to save some money - you'll regret! Insist on a city view luxury room - even you may be charged more tba 500 EUR per night - it's worth it - and: pls 2 nights! Why? Do it, and you'll know! Too much to see, to do, to experience ... Sunste at sky park pool, the bars and restaurants ... And just the room itself ... Anyway, up 2 u, but take my words .... Youll never regret!",5
"Sky Park is on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands and is by far one of the most beautiful places to visit in Singapore with breathtaking skyline views of the city, especially at night. If you are not staying in the hotel they do have a charge, I'm not sure how much but I can assure you that it's worth it. We've stayed at this hotel on several occasions and we always look forward to coming back. A must see when in Singapore!",5
"I stayed in Marina Bay Sands (Gardens by the bay view) last year. It was really beautiful.  However I was really happy with my room this time. I stayed in city view suite on 37 floor (Club room) for 4 nights. I loved the view and size of the room. I had garden view in my rest room too. It was a super clean room with amazing view. What could be better than that?   ""Sky pool"" was a little bit crowded, but still beautiful! I enjoyed breakfast in ""Club 55"" every morning.   If you visit Singapore, you must try ""Marina Bay Sands!!"" ",5
"The hotel is wonderful and it is definitely worth upgrading to the suite. With the suite you get an amazing selection of breakfast at the lounge, as well as afternoon tea. You get to become totally full with the afternoon tea and you don't need dinner afterwards. The quality and selection of the food is superb. The rooms are massive - like a small apartment. And you get to access the famous infinity pool. Worth the money so I would absolutely return.",5
"All my expectations were exceeded. Check in was smooth, we were a little early, however the staff at the counter allowed us to access our rooms early.   Infinity pool was amazing. Lots of kids though, so not a place to relax. Prices for food and drink are expensive but that's expected.   Would definitely come back as long as I've got a wallet full of cash. ",5
"We stayed in this hotel for our last night in Singapore early January 2016. We knew it was a big hotel and there would be a lot of commotion but it was worse than we expected. In order to check in we had to queu with our luggages for 25 mins in order to get our room key (and there are three receptions in this hotel - one per tower) Not much was explained concerning where the pool was located nor how to reach the garden outside. The room was good, and the bed was quite comfortable. The pool was extremely crowded as we assumed and the water was incredibly cold! Also you need to take a specific elevator to reach the pool which is confusing as when we asked staff members for directions they all had different anwsers on how to reach the pool. The staff was very helpfull and quite…",2
"My fiancé & I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 1 night, we spent the day at the infinity pool rekaxing.  We were so surprised at the exceptional service received from all employees but especially Karla and Maricor! We expected a high level of service but this hotel has left us speechless! Well done,  we'll be back again! ",5
We spent only one night. We took a city view room in upper levels (tower 3) and saw the beautiful view from the crazy swimming pool and the terrace at night (to see Gardens by the bay). We choose this hotel to see the swimming pool and to go easily to gardens of the bay. The service is not personnalized as there are too many people and we got several different answers at  the same question. The breakfast is very nice at the terrace on the roof You need to go down Gardens by the bay if you want to see the show (it's a little bit too high and far from the terrace of the hotel),4
"I haven't come across another hotel foyer that is so busy!!  There were people standing in queues at the front desk and outside the hotel. Unbelievable that people can be so patient!! A very attractive interior with high ceilings, wooden panels and lots of glass. ",3
"This is a huge hotel. So big we didn't see all of it. The sky infinity pool really makes this place. There are some stunning views of Singapore. We really enjoyed our stay here and it is well worth doing at least once! We managed to get a very late checkout too, thanks to the friendly hotel manager. Really helped us out!",4
Marina Bay is so different from places I have seen before. On one hand overwhelming nature and on the other hand everything designed with this amazing perfection and idea in mind. Very unique and definitely place to see!,5
I spent some 2 hours each 2 days in the casino at the hotel...What a large casino..I enjoyed and had great great fun..definitely a place to visit when in Singapore. Entry for travellers is free. Residents and citizens are charged SGD 100 for entry,4
"It is a plesure to see such modern architecture, people are limitless. Now you can swim at sky! I can name Marina Bay Sands as an extraordinary hotel. I felt like I'm in ancient Babylon for a second at sky pool.",5
"My family and I stayed here for the formula 1 Grand Prix in 2015. From start to finish this was a fantastic stay. On arrival we were escorted to the VIP check-in, a stunning room with serene decor. Complimentary refreshments were provided whilst my husband checked us in. We were upgraded to a higher floor without any prompting.  The room is clean and modern and the view of the bay was superb.  The breakfast was great and timings convenient. Throughout the weekend the hotel was buzzing. The atmosphere was second to none. Numerous dining options and shopping spots are endless.  The ultimate is the rooftop pool...it is spectacular and is a must to experience. As a hotel guest you have priority access. However, I do feel there should be a part of the day were only hotel guests may…",5
"The best location in Singapore, great service, stunning view, best suites ever . Great service, very good restaurants, near the shopping mall, very nice casino, and very friendly staff. Next time we will stay again in de Marina Bay Sands for sure.",5
"This was my second time staying at Marina Bay Sands, my partner's first. I came back to Singapore, solely (well one of the main reasons), to stay at MBS again, and purely chose the hotel because of it's 57th floor Infinity Pool. It's simply amazing, the views across Singapore are some of the best in the world, the skyscrapers feel so close you can touch them. There are however many other great things about the hotel as well.   Rooms are spacious, ours had a small balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the ocean where you can try and count the abundance of ships anchored. It's truly a sight to see. The hotel is fully equipped and being attached to the shoppes at Marina Bay would benefit the designer seeking fashionista.... But beware, you need some serious $$ or credit…",5
"We stayed at this hotel in Aug 2015.We booked 2 rooms asking for one of the rooms to have twin beds as I have a son & daughter 18yrs & 15yrs old.  Check in felt like I was on the airport really busy had to queue up wait for ages. At the desk I requested to the receptionist for interconnecting rooms with one of the to have twin beds, she said yes that's already on your booking.  We were then just told at reception to take the lift to our floor given the keys.  No one showed us up to the rooms. When u pay this kind of price for a 5* hotel I did expect the courtesy for a member of staff to at least take you up to your room show u the facilities.  Once we found our rooms both bedrooms had king size beds,I rang reception she said she would send someone up straight away to sort the…",3
"Location is the best you can get in Singapore. You have it all in walking distance, shops, great restaurants, parks etc. Skypark is very unique and magical, would not like to leave at all. Rooms are huge and more beautiful than in the pictures. A tip: do not leave the pool as long as the sun is shining, next day it might not. Sunset and sunrise both are worth experiencing by the pool. The only minus is that you cannot spend the day by the pool after you have left you keys.",5
"So I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands a few times now. Generally its a decent hotel. Its too large to expect that personal service but id say its clean and well kept hotel. Big rooms, fast internet and untold facilities. Its golden crown is obviously the infinity pool on 55th floor. Not sure it would have as many visitors without it. Food is over priced but you get used to that.  Now the real bad bit.....as i write this I am trying to sleep in tower 2 on the 22nd floor at 11:20pm. There is a rock concert on (Laneways Festival) directly behind the hotel in the Gardens By The Bay. The volume of the music is literally shaking the double glazed windows and can feel the bass through me sat in my room. Now correct me if this is wrong but what moron gave the go ahead for such a festival…",2
"So, whenever we went to Singapore,  we would make the effort and save up to stay at Marina Bay Sands hotel. Our first experience was such a delight and really unforgettable, so we thought why not relive it.  However,  our last few stays were sliding downwards to being quite mediocre.   Firstly,  check in was almost a 30minute experience. Im not sure why it took so long, especially when it was all prepaid already. Not to mention, the lady serving us was showing some disdain we were taking up her time.   Secondly, we were placed in tower 2. Outside our room, well noisy. This was from the noise of the lobby and its restaurants. It was  also not mentioned during check in that there was a music festival going on outside.  Which we could hear the bass quite clearly through the closed…",3
"This is a GIANT hotel with hundreds of guests and rooms its pretty chaotic but the staff handle it with ease. they have an amazing modern asian cuisine restaurant in the hotel. The day spa is fantastic, massages are world class. pool was way to busy even at 9:30 at night. Gym was fantastic for a hotel. Views are unbeatable, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in singapore.",5
"Upon arrival, we received a complimentary upgrade to a better suite overlooking the Gardens By The Bay. There was a huge line, but we skipped, maybe it was just our luck. Its famous infinity pool had a stunning panoramic view of the city skyline. The hotel runs alongside Singapore's largest mall, which had absolutely everything we needed.",5
"I love, love, love this hotel! Stayed for two nights on the deluxe room of 33rd flr. The view is breathtaking! The room is spacious and elegant-looking. The have great customer service, making sure our stay is more than comfortable. I love that we could just hang around at the pool anytime we want or take a stroll at the mall.",5
"Singapore is lovely destinations for all sorts of tourists. Very easy to navigate, exhilarating spots to see, wonderful people to meet, cheap transportation, and exotic destinations to stay, eat and enjoy. Every year one finds something new there and we get a feeling that this is our first visit.",5
"We were very impressed with the hotel and it's location.  We arrived too early for our room to be ready upon check-in, but it was no problem for concierge to store our luggage. Front office reception gave us keycards to access the infinity pool area and explore the hotel while our room was being prepared. The whole check-in process was very fast and the staff very pleasant. We took the elevators to the 57th roof-top to see the infinity pool.  Wow! what a view!  It was 9:00am and the pool was  quite busy.  However we found that if we were at the pool 6:00am when it first opened, we were on our own for the first hour. We managed to get our morning swim, take photos and enjoy sunrise before the crowds. There are also jacuzzis on the roof top.  Our room was in Tower 3 on the 37th…",5
"Very expensive and definitely not worth the money.  Nice room.   Crap services. Sitting here after check out and there are no seats or lounge areas.  You cannot access the pool area.  All shops are owned by marina bay in walking distance so all casino style fake stores. No heart, no real owners.  Wow. $500 for a bed.  Stayed at the hotel oasia this trip also. Under $200 per night and a better hotel and much better service and location. ",2
We come here with Changi airport facilities when we transit from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket.  This building is good and eye cathing.  I will go there again if Ii go to Singapore again.  It was free access from Changi with a good guide,3
We splashed out and got 2 suites with access to the Club breakfast and all the special things that comes with that. I had tried to book a suite at the Ritz Carlton but could not get their web site to work and they did not replay to me email. Marina Bay Sands is a magnificence building and the shopping centre is amazing. Must stay place! ,5
"Even if the property has a lot of rooms, the staff was very professional, very careful, prompt and offered real 5* services. I expected to wait a lot at ck-in and check-out and I was very pleased to find out that we didin't wait more than 5 minutes. The pool was great with extremly nice staff, great view. The room was very clean and with great view from the 37th foor.",5
"We absolutely loved Marina Bay Sands, and Singapore!!   We arrived two hours early, and were able to pay for an ungraded room and get access immediately. (No queue at check-in when we arrived).   I had booked a club room, but the upgraded room we received was bigger than the room I had booked. Our room was on a high floor and OMG what a view over the bay!! We both just stood there for ages saying wow!  Our room was massive, with a huge super comfy bed. Separate dressing area, and massive bathroom with huge bath. The toiletries supplied are nice – I never bothered unpacking mine and just used those provided by the hotel.   It is definitely worth paying the extra for a club room. Breakfast is included, and there is a massive choice, something to suit everyone. No queues for a…",5
"very good hotel with casino staff very good, a little bit long queue at check-in, it takes 30mins +- to check in every single time  room very good, very nice swimming pool on the rooftop  so many delicious food downstairs  nice view",5
"Too big , the lobby is like a Trains station at Rush times , the swimming pool at the top is funny , very good food at all restaurants, Rooms are normal for the price . Swiming pool at the top floor is worth to see  ",4
This place is ridiculous. I have been to 5 star hotels but this is more like an airport! So busy with people with their bags flying everywhere it's worse than universal studios! If you want a relaxing holiday do not stay here. The breakfast is so busy and stressful it's worse than a theme park. My fiancé and I wanted to look at a menu for dinner that night but were quickly turned away by a rude staff member who suggested it was too expensive for us and wouldn't let us look at the menu when we were very interested in going to Wolfgang pucks restaurant.. So we went to his other one instead.  The room is very nice though with a decent view but who wants to stay on their room all day. The pool of course has a nice view which you can see anywhere else perhaps but is way too cold to…,2
"If you want to have the best views of Singapore, day or night, then Marina Bay Sands is the hotel for you. We always stay here whenever we are in Singapore, the service and staff are super friendly and accomadating. They have one of the top rated Infiniti pools in the world that in on the roof located on the 57th floor, called Sky Park where they also have restaurants, and clubs for nightlife and fine dining. You can also visit Gardens by the bay which is breathtaking while overlooking the Singapore Flyer. This hotel has it all, Great location on the water, shopping mall, Casino, Entertainment and so much more. ",5
"This hotel has turned into a Disney Land attraction. Sure the building and overall architecture is impressive. But if you want value for money and a somewhat personal atmosphere do not stay here. Breakfast has gigantic queue, restaurants are packed and the price you pay is sky high (as high as the building itself)   Don't come here if you're expecting to relax. If your aim is to visit and take selfies from the infinity pool, then go for it.",2
"The architecture is amazing. The infinity pool is a dream! We stayed few nights in the Marina Bay suite, ohhh I think it is my favourite hotel ever! If you have to visit Singapore, go there! Bars, service, restaurants amazing as well",5
"Let's start with this being the MOST amazing building - and for this reason alone makes it worth a stay. PLUSES:  The swimming pool on the top floor is extraordinary - fortunately they have now restricted this to hotel guests only with entry via room key turnstiles.  The rooms are modern, impeccably clean with great views from either side of the building.  Close to the beautiful gardens.  It links easily to the huge shopping arcade and casino. Excellent wifi too. MINUSES:  It's big and busy!  Check-in took a while and it's a big place if you want to get around easily. Overall HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - will definitely stay here again.",5
"Our room was on the 53 floor on the Marina side. Fantastic views from floor to ceiling windows. The rooms are basic hotel rooms, but nice. The real reason to stay at MBS is for the view. The pool has a fantastic view, but need to get up there early to get a spot. We found the lounge at Spago to be fantastic for evening drinks. The spa at MBS is the Banyan Tree, which does great massages from rooms with views. Not a place to go if you are looking for exclusivity, but overall a relaxing stay.  Overall, great stay and would go back.",5
i like it very much when check inn i take coffee and then have tea at breakfast clean and clear room and rate is excellent wao great hotel and great facility,5
"A wonderful casino with large number of table games and slot machines. Free access to foreign nationals, but ensure to have your passport for casino entry. Definitely a recommended visit with a decent payout ratio, and they serve drinks and food within the floor.   But mind the excessive amount of smoke within the casino, which can be annoying to a non smoker.",5
Even though it was just for 1 night I had a blast. The room is big and mine was facing the city. Loved it. The bathroom is awesome with a tub and everything. Really huge bathroom. The infinity pool on top was fun to try. Not so crowded as you expect. Easy check-in and check-out. Did not have breakfast there so can't tell. But again it sure is worth a stay. ,5
We were put up here for a business conference. The venue was the location across the road. So not much time spent in the hotel.   The rooms are large. Wifi speed is excellent. No restriction on number of device. We had four device connected at the same time.,3
"The infinity pool looking over Singapore is spectacular!  A must see, that exceeded expectations. The table service by the pool is excellent, however a few extra selections on the pool bar food would have been nice. We were there when the haze in Singapore was exceptionally high, so will be back for a clearer day! The rooms were also fabulous, large glass windows for a breathtaking view, we paid extra for a city view room and it was worth it! Make sure you go to the pool at night to see Singapore's financial district lit up! ",4
"Stayed at Garden view room and the view is beautiful. The room has a balcony too. The toilet is huge and the bed is a huge king size. Average room, I do give it 4 stars.  The view of Infinity Pool is stunning. It's beautiful at day, sunset and night times. However, it is crowded most of the time. The pool is only strictly accessible by hotel guest only. Great for crowd control. So please bring to room key if you're planning to visit the Infinity Pool for entrance. As for the Observation deck, it is accessible by both public and hotel guest. If you're not a hotel guest, you'll need to pay for a entrance fee but still will not have access to the pool.  Directly connected to the shoppes and is only a few walks away from gardens by the bay, helix bridge, Singapore flyer etc. great…",4
"The Marina Bay Sands is one of those places that you just need to journey to for a unique experience. The soaring lobby, rooftop infinity pool, views for the sky deck lounges/bars, are what sets this place apart from other hotels. The room was very well equipped and comfortable. But it is the other areas of the hotel that let you know, ""you are not in Kansas anymore"". In the evening take your camera and move towards the edge of the infinity pool at night and as you approach the edge 57 stories above the ground you can feel a little dizzy, but you will be treated to a city skyline light view that you will not see anywhere else in the world from a pool. I could go on and on with features, the endless shops/restaurants just outside in the covered mall, the view from any room is…",5
"We chose this hotel as a special treat for my 50th birthday. And we wasn't disappointed. The views were amazing from the top.  We was upgraded to a suite on the 53rd floor which was huge, and had stunning views of the city. The rooms were clean and tidy and housekeeping did a great job. The infinity pool was good but did get overcrowded at times.  The restaurants were ok but expensive, i would recommend a short taxi ride to Clarke Quay for meals and drinks.  Overall a great place to stay and would highly recommend.",5
"We organized a regional sales meeting in Marina Bay Sand but the booking process is slow and inefficient. They requested to fill up form, front and back credit card images. Scan and email to them after several calls and email communication.",1
"I booked a room for my parents for their anniversary, and I'm so happy I sprung for the cost. We all had a great time, and I was able to make them feel special on their special day.   I asked for an upgrade, and reception granted it when I told them it was for my parents' anniversary.   The hotel is more expensive than others, but you can't beat the experience. It's clean, luxurious, and high end. Apart from the much touted infinity pool, definitely try the boiling hot jacuzzi pool at the roof top. ",5
"The Marina Bay Sands is easily accessed by City Bus Service. The Soaring, Majestic Foyer is Delight to the Senses & Uplifts the Spirit. Entry Fee to the Observation Deck is rather Stiff. The Wooden-floored Observation Deck, High Up in the Sky, offers an Enthralling 360-degree View, including Glorious Views of the outer Harbour. Illustrated Panels at several Locations on the Periphery point out the Important Singapore Landmarks on View. Absence of Seating on the vast Deck limits the Time to as long as one can Stand - or plonk on the wooden floor ! Refreshment available is very limited. Overall, not a Great Value-for-Money.",3
The Marina Bay Sands is an awesome hotel.  The sheer size of it takes your breath away and naturally the highlight is the enormous infinity pool at the top.  The rooms are huge and the service immaculate.  Well worth visiting if your budget can stretch it.,5
"Just stayed in MBS Hotel over the weekend and would like to feedback on a few good and poor areas.   Good: Bed and bathtub is huge and comfortable.  Bad:  1. We booked a Garden View Premier room on MBS website but was given a room with city view. When we called the frontdesk to check, we were told that Garden view and city view rooms are assigned to guest subject to availability. I do not remember seeing this clause while doing the reservation online. The most disappointed part is the so called 'city view' is very bad facing the shopping mall and taxi-stand.   2. The layout of the room is very different from what you saw on the MBS website. Bed is facing the window instead of TV. We need to tilt the TV in an angle so that we can watch it from the bed.   3. TV remote control is…",3
"Great architecture and definitely work looking at. As a passerby, this building is impressive. The location is convenient and the building is just breathtaking. This building views well from across the harbour and right up front.   The hotel itself is a very typical 5-6 star hotel. The service is excellent and the services they provide are top quality.  However, I do recommend staying on the upper floors (even for a premium) as the views from the lower floors seem to be very limited. You also get your own personal balcony. Nothing to complain about at it.",5
"It was amazing . I recommend to try staying in marina bay sands cause the environment is clean , room spacious , it is easy to get to places like food courts and has a beautiful view. The service is fast especially WiFi ... The food might be pricey but delicious ... Swimming pool clean and has a pub up at the swimming pool.. Friendly staff , comfortable and kids will surely like it and for kids below 12 has a 50% discount . it is opposite garden by the bay and a few kilometers away from LAU pat sat which is also known as a food court. And if you are lazy to take a cab to LAU pat sat, I also recommend to eat at Singapore flyer food court and you can even ride the Singapore flyer and the view is breathtaking . you might go like this ""holly molly cheese it is amazing"" hahahaha ",5
"Overall, a disappointing stay at the Marina Bay Sands. Having looked forward to our stay to celebrate a 30th birthday, we were hoping for great service and fabulous facilities. From the moment we arrived, things did not get off to a good start. Check in is extremely slow (not helped by the fact that only two members of staff were on the desk). Important information was not given at check in, I.e breakfast times and locations etc. Having had a long journey, I forgot to ask these questions at the time. When asking later we were told there were two breakfast locations and we could choose between scenery or variety, something that for the price of the day I'd have hoped would have come together! However, we chose scenery and went for breakfast around 9:30am (having been told it's…",2
"The main reasons to stay in this hotel are the infinity pool with postcard views of the Singapore skyline and the casino, if you are into gambling. Everything else is pretty average.   We stayed in a Bay suite which had beautiful views of Marina Bay and the skyline. The rooms in the suite were huge, definitely among the largest I've encountered in Singapore hotels. Furnishing was not to my taste but the room was very clean.   The hotel is crowded. Expect plenty of families and loud children, some staying and some Sightseeing. The casinos also draw crowds.   One benefit of staying here is the proximity to Gardens by the Bay. You should check these gardens out whether you are staying in MBS or not. ",3
"Decided to try Marina Bay Sands whilst travelling to Asia via Singapore recently - main reason was so we could ""do the pool"" . Iconic building / architecture / great location.  Enjoyed the pool early one morning when it was quiet. In the afternoon , the pool is understandably VERY BUSY ( think crowded suburban pool in Australia ).  Also , everyone is pre-occupied with taking selfies . ( think Bogans with money )",4
"Very busy with staff focussed on processing quickly rather than delighting customers, architecture very impressive, room average, not great value at price but worth staying one night for pool etc and then shift onto to another hotel to get the real Singapore feel- everything very expensive compared to better hotels with a much better vibe",2
Absolute must for Singapore. It is not the 'fanciest' hotel in SG but no other offers more and it is absolutely unique. I stayed for 2 nights as a stopover en route to Australia and was the best way to begin our adventure. Rooftop pool is outstanding and can't be topped (literally). If you can't afford to stay your entire trip at least book one or two nights here for the pool at least.,5
"The view of the city is astonishing.... Me and my wife were both speechless the moment the curtain opened when we entered the room.   Cozy, but staycation is all worth it!  The only hang up we had was we planned to check out at 11:30am when we could no longer enter the room at 11:10 because the checkout time, is 11am! We were properly accommodated. For no fee.   I just suggest that although the check out time is written on the doc provided, the front desk personnel should clearly say it to customers since most of vacationistas do not want to read anything at all. :)  Oh, the view at the pool is great! I wish to experience this again. :)",4
My wife and I stayed here fir a birthday treat. It was everything we expected and hoped for. The infinity pool is just amazing day or night. The only issue was the number of people but that had to be expected. It was expensive but worth it.,5
"The lobby is like a shopping mall, there are around 1000 people that are not hotel guests. None of the staff even looked at us in the eyes, we were just the next people for them who came to take a shot at the pool. The only person that smiled at us is the lady that cleaned our room. And the infinity pool is full of people who are not staying at the hotel, and yes the view is great.",3
"Was planning a staycation for my wife's birthday celebration and i decided to have it at Marina Bay Sands. I booked for a deluxe room. On the day of check in, the queue was filled with tourist. I was ushered to the VIP concierge instead. The lady who was doing my check in told me that Jeraldine (I'm not sure what's her position) upgraded my room to a suite for free!  They even send a cake and a letter to our room, congratulating my wife's birthday. This is truly top-notch customer service! The room was enormous and the city view was superb on 52nd floor. Guess i don't have to describe much about the pool. I would really like to thank Jearldine who made our entire stay so wonderful.!",5
"We came for the infiniy pool and views. The pool area was incredibly busy, we wondered around for 10 minutes to find a bed. Their card swipe system is a joke, so many people couldn't understand how it worked. They had a staff member at each checkpoint having I explain how I worked when they could have just used a sign. The room we stayed in stank, smelt like it wasn't cleaned properly. This place was on my bucket list and the only saving grace was the view. Save yourself some money and give this place a miss.",1
Definitely a stunning hotel to stay at with beautiful views and the pool lives up to its extraordinary reputation.  We stayed in a deluxe city view room and we were very happy. The bathroom is huge! We were also very happy with the room service which was delivery promptly and very delicious.   We were also happy with the service at the pool.  Our only small complaint about the room is the sensitivity of the Mini bar and being charged if you did need a fridge.  The other thing is that the lobby of the hotel definitely feels more like a tourist attraction rather than the lobby of a 5 star hotel - I think something can be done to make this more private for hotel guests.  Will definitely stay again.,4
"I spent the majority of my time in the Infinity Pool drinking Singapore Slings with a friend. We then proceded to drink more in the foyer and in the room with room service. They were tasty and certainly went down well. I had only one night there this time and enjoyed it so much we tried to get a second night, but unfortunately it was booked out. It is such and incredible place to stay, everything about it is great. Luxury hotels are not usually my thing but no trip to Singapore would be complete without spending at least one night here for me now, and one night was not enough. I usually book my holidays well ahead and with the Marina Bay Sands I keep my eye out constantly to get a good rate. I like to get a room with a view of the city, day or night it's spectacular. The staff…",5
"This is a casino hotel that compares better to Vegas than to anywhere local. The difference is that Vegas hotels know what business people want and deliver it very effectively. The Sands has the singular goal to part guests from their money, and as a result is so unhelpful as to be unworkable for a business person. No late check outs, bizarre access to club facilities (which I paid a lot for), incredible lines at checkin, more lines at checkout, lines for taxis, lines for everything and enormous crowds in the public areas. The hotel is focussed 100% on gambling and mass tourism, despite an impressive property that compares with anything in Asia and a great location that is business friendly. Service is polite and well drilled, but incredibly uptight and fearful of breaking…",1
"2nd stay. 44th floor suite. Brilliant views and super clean room. Room serice was excellent. Its a real pain if you go to the pool with your family only to find that everyone needs a room key to get in, but you will only forget once. The alcohol at the bar is expensive even for Singapore. The pool is always full unless its late evening or it rains. Love staying here.",5
"We stayed here for 2 nights, family of 2 adults, 2 young children, we had city view on the 34th floor , twin room.Amazing ceiling to floor windows with spectacular view, gorgeous room, large area, big bathroom , heaps of space.On the 57th level is the most amazing infinity pool you will ever swim in, has to be experienced, the view is incredible across to Singapore city.On one side across the road you have a huge shopping mall with every brand label you could think of and cafes and restaurants along the waters edge. The ocean side has the Marina Bay gardens, so beautiful by day, stunning at night.The Sands is definitely a must, pricey but an experience you shall treasure for ever.Great staff, great food, amazing building , delicious food, breathtaking pool area, was worth every…",5
"Ok, this hotel is amazing! The staff are very professional, friendly and so incredibly willing to help. We were very impresed. A special mention to Daniel on the Sky deck pool service. He was wonderful in fact all staff at this hotel are wonderful. The rooms are spacious and luxurious and definitely have that wow factor. While this hotel is definitely high end, it's not pretentious and offers a fabulous environment to relax and unwind. ",5
"We've had just a 1 night stay in the place since we can't afford for more nights!  The place is just right to be that pricey! It's worth it. You'll just have to be very conscious with your time trying to enjoy enjoy the view, be in their breathtaking pool.",5
"We decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands during our layover from bali for one reason only... the infinity pool. My husband and I were both very impressed at the architecture of the hotel. It is massive and has  a casino, mall, and lots of restaurants. The pool is impressive and very nice. Its very crowded during the afternoon, so it's probably best to go during the morning. The hotel staff and very friendly and the room we had offered a beautiful view of the bay and gardens. One thing I especially enjoyed was the bed. It as very comfortable and I slept like a baby. This hotel by far is the best we've stayed at and we were very sad to have only spent one day here. We look forward to visiting again in the future.",5
Stayed with the family.   We arrived early and were given a room immediately which was fantastic.   The staff were friendly and accommodating.   Room was well appointed and roomy with amazing city views.   You have to pay for every extra which is the only negative. A S$200 per night 'deposit' to simply have the fridge unlocked is a but rich.   All in all a pleasant stay. The shops nearby are all high end and unless you can afford Louis Vitton as your daily wardrobe unaffordable to the average person.   The skylark pool has amazing views but gets very crowded so getting s seat after 7am is near impossible. Not a place to relax given how busy it gets.   The MRT is downstairs allowing easy access to the rest of Singapore (and affordable restaurants).   Definitely a place you have…,4
"A trip to Singapore is incomplete without visiting the marina bay sands, off course you see this hotel from every major attraction in the city and it looks stunning, it's the crown to Singapore's skyline, the shopping mall is huge and you can spend an entire day just exploring the various things out here, the helix bridge and orchid garden nearby is a must visit, love this place!",5
"Treated my children and myself to a 3 night stopover here on the way home from a holiday in -Vietnam & Cambodia loved it & hope to come back! Great rooms & amenities. Pity the hotel cannot guarantee a sofa bed for the 3rd person in the room upon booking (six months ago!), but the housekeeping staff were able to source one thankfully. All the service staff were friendly, courteous & helpful, as is the Singapore way. A big thank you to Michael on checkout- loved his service & smile. Shops & dining very expensive, but other options able to be found. Hope  to come again & stay in a higher level room!",5
We booked this hotel for only one reason to experience the infinity pool and skypark. The hotel is very luxurious with amenities of any five star hotel. Best time to enjoy the pool is early morning to get both night and day views as sun comes up around 7.00 am and pool opens around 6.00 am. Stay here for a day enjoy the luxuries and the great view from the pool.,4
I was very excited to stay in Marina Bay Sands. It turned out to be exceptional experience. Rooms were big enough and were well furnished.   I was not happy with Check-In experience. Receptionist was not attentive as others. She did not explained where are the different activities and how to use Key card for access to Infinity Pool. I went to infinity pool without Key card only to find out I need to carry this. I saw almost everyone got 2 small bottles of water when checking in. I didn't got. It's not a big deal as such but as a guest I don't appreciate less attention than other guests. I thought she was busy with some other work and was not focused on the guests.  Infinity Pool as the reputation precedes was awesome. The view is breathtaking. Although in the evening it was…,4
"You cannot compare to other hotel, the pool is really awesome. The staff very friendly. Best to come here with your family or partner. I appreciate the service of the housekeepers, they are doing a great job. Receptionist are helpful specially Michelle.",5
"Here are a few things that I like and dislike about this hotel.  Likes: + Very close to the casino. + Access to the Skydeck infinity pool.  Dislikes: - Very long check-in queue. - Very basic room despite being a 5 star hotel and the high room rates. - Mediocre customer service rendered. - Due to the hotel being nearly fully booked most of the time, majority of guests are treated like cattle and given mediocre customer service with the exception for the VIPs and High Rollers. - Infinity pool water doesn't look clean at all!",3
"After hearing so much about this hotel, we decided to try it during our trip to Singapore during Christmas.   The pool definitely is nice - but in terms of other aspects of the hotel, it is way too crowded and reminded me of a 3 star tourist hotel in a 2nd tier city in mainland China.  The fact that it is attached to a giant mall and also close to the gardens by the bay was nice, but in terms of the actual hotel itself, it is nothing to write home about.",3
"we ad a wondeful view over the harbour, te breakfast was awsome, te roof top pool ,a kind of its own, te rooms are clean and good. we stayed there only 2 nigts and  we stayed 2 nights in an cheaper hotel , bcs of our budget. i enjoyed very much the hotel ..but hmm, likje verywhere in singapore you have the choice beetween good and to expensive of cheaper and bad. marina sands is a must go, but  the price is really high on the hotel by its self ,its nothing to complain",5
"Make sure to spend your day at the hotel when you book it. The beds are very comfortable, the room has good wifi and amenities. It's spacious, squeaky clean and great view. I've stayed here few times and I just don't get tired of it. The infinity pool, Jacuzzi is great, but of course it comes with the price. The staffs are nice, i lost my room access card and they replaced it right away without any hassle. If you find the food at the menu expensive, you can always go to food court area (near skating rink) of MBS where they serve affordable and many varieties of dishes.",5
"Rooms were great, view was amazing and the pool too.  But for the price you pay you expect better customer service and general experience.   The wifi was timed so that when you checkout, you lose wifi instantly, which is annoying if you are waiting around after to catch a cab, mrt or bus before departure to the airport (as an international guest with no SNG sim card).   Not being able to drink in the casino was weird, but i guess that's the rules. The passport to get in is also painful.   The service at the checkin desk felt like i was waiting a the post office to collect my pension.  It was all rather drab.",3
"A gigantic hotel located at the marina bay, quite close to the city centre. Convenient location if you look for the luxurious shopping experience. Not particularly close to those scenic spot like merlion and Ochard Road in my point of view.  The greatest plus to the hotel is the rooftop pool. A long long one and very very crowded one, lots of in house guests and outside visitors. You dont really swim here. Spectacular view. Its nice to spend an afternoon here before the dinner.  For the room, quite spacious indeed, especially the toilet. The view from the room is not bad. We stayed at the 32nd floor, a bit distant from the high zone floor.   Quite disappointing that the rollaway bed was not ready upon our arrival. We had to call Housekeeping and look for that. So do the extra…",4
"We honestly booked this as it was almost compulsory to try out that massive rooftop pool and considering you can only go in as a guest it was a choice made easy! I was expecting a Vegas trashy style hotel but honestly it was the nicest night we stayed in Singapore with access to the casino, mall and the gardens by the bay and considering the building itself is spectacular to look at we were so pleased we stayed here! the rooms were lovely with a great view of the marina, wrote pricey but then we knew what we were getting ourselves into, would definitely return to this hotel!",5
"Its a amazing place to visit at least once in your life time. The Pool side is mesmerising and worth being a symbol of such a beautiful country. Nice view from the top, here when I felt like paradise.",5
A++++++ awesome and fabulous views the lunch was awesome we had a three course meal it was professional would definitely go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Looked at pool looks really scary how they made it look like it just falls off the edge,5
Marina Bay Sands makes you feel like you're in paradise! My partner had already experinced this hotel before and knew I would love it. We had a city view room on the 45th floor and.....WOW! Amazing. We could see the laser show on the river at night right from the comfort of our hotel room.   I did think it could get any better until we went to the top to experience the famous infinity pool. The view was out of this world but I would have to say that there were far too many kids around... it was packed.   Overall our stay was great and we didn't even need to catch a cab anywhere because every shop/restaurant you could think of was part of the hotel.,4
"It’s my 3rd return to MBS and I’m still impressed by this hotel. We checked in for X-Mas and had a fabulous stay as well as an outstanding multi-course dinner at Sky on 57th. There is nothing to fault, except check-in and out which tends to be rather slow.",5
"It's symbol of Singapore, infinity pool just amazing day and night more impresive. Pool closing 22 00! You can't go to pool if you not hotel guest. First floor in the building many shops, huge casino and many restaurants where you can eat cheap. Night time the have light show outside Marina bay sands, best wiew from bayfront. It's enough just one day in this hotel if you saving money. Price from 350 dolars, if you 2 persons not that bad ;).Recommend to visit!",5
"Booked Marina Bay Sands for a mix of work and pleasure for a week.  Singapore a favourite destination and again fantastic.  people, place and climate all great.  Marina Bay Sands is mind boggling. Massive hotel with great staff.  Room fantastic with a view to the water and city!  Big issue is the sheer size.  Always too many people. Never can relax.  Infinity Pool great idea spoiled by sea of humanity in small space. Club lounge fantastic food and service spoiled by...simply too many people.    Hotel has issue coping.  Had to walk away from Concierge desk twice because sheer volume of guests swamped available staff. TV in our room didn't work first day and was fixed fast. Second day, system overloaded and shut down for 17 mins.  Third day, shut down for a few hours.  We watched…",4
"Having a 4 day, 3 night adventure in Singapore between our journeys between Thailand and Vietnam. We decided that Marina Bay Sands would be a must! Being a bucket list place we decided to take the opportunity and stay a night. The lobby is grand, staff great and we got a free upgrade for being... Well smiling and nice (we suppose haha). With a room on the 25 floor over looking the bay it was beautiful. We took full advantage of the hotel, a must of course is heading to the top floor to use the pool, hot tub and take photos haha. The hotel is linked with the MRT, a casino, High end shopping mall and essentially every thing you need. We spent the first day in Singapore in and around the hotel. You almost need to devote the time. ",5
"Though known as Singapore's landmark, MBS is really not worthy the money you pay to stay there.   Room: everything is just average and standard- not the five-star quality anyone will expect.   Infinity Pool: one of things most tourists are looking forward it. however, it is also the DIRTIEST AND MOST CROWDED PUBLIC POOL i have ever seen.   Lobby: all i can say is you feel like in a train station or something.   So overall, it's quite disappointing given the money it charges and its reputation. You definitely don't feel like in a luxury hotel whatsoever.   The only good thing is the view.",2
"My husband and I decided to spend the extra money thinking it would be worth it. We have stayed in some amazing hotel especially in Las Vegas and other parts of the world. The money was was to overpriced for what we got! the rooms were not that great, we had a balcony with no furniture to sit on and the balcony was quite dirty. The toilet flush button was very stiff and hard to get it to work. Breakfast was $48 per person, (For the price of the room, you think they would include it) Everything bar/restaurant in the hotel, especially at the sky bar was way to overpriced for what it was. $26US a cocktail, $14US a beer! The only great thing was the amazing view. We stayed for 3 nights but feel one night would be enough, unless you have money, There are better hotels nearby for half…",1
"Marina Bay Sands is probably the most unique hotel I've ever stayed in. The infinity pool was interesting. While The self-serve check-out is so convenient and easy, the check-in process was rather puzzling. You didn't know which side of the building entrance you needed to go to check-in. Luckily, I had a hotel concierge gentleman that recognize my confusion, took me right to a special counter area with no line up to get me settled. Greatly appreciated this gesture.  This hotel has plenty of shopping venues and adventure experiences that ranges from powering out through the hotel exit lane in a Lambo.",5
"This hotel was everything I expected and more. It has been my dream to stay her for a long time and I am so glad we paid to go here. Hotel was £250 for the night but we were off season, however I found this reasonable and it's no more than what I have paid in London. The pool is an absolute must and the views are spectacular I absolutely loved it and would definitely stay again and recommend. Not to be missed! ",5
"The location is great.  Checking was a zip even though it looked and felt like an airport. Huge open space that connects the 3 towers looked liked being in the future.  Just like the city of Singapore, you are transported into a different time - the distant future. Surreal. The only reason we stayed here is the famous swimming pool & it did not disappoint indeed.  I would have loved to stay the whole day and enjoy the sights of Singapore from dawn to dusk but unfortunately, we have 2 other sights to see.  First the Garden at the Bay... but hey, it was our (best) view from the room. It was spectacular indeed.  The night view is also to die for.",5
"This is the place to stay if you plan to experience Singapore. It is famous for its infinity pool but besides being a landmark, the hotel definitely live up to its reputation. The staff were amazing and were always willing to help. We stayed at the premiere room overlooking the Garden by the Bay which was very beautiful at night. Definitely felt like royalty here!",5
"Staying at the Marina Sand is so confusing ... Thousands of people everywhere . I ve booked the hotel for the famous infinity pool ... Impossible to stay there ... I had to wait 20 mn to find a  sun bed ... People can access to the pool paying an entrance if they do not stay at the hotel , guests do not have any priority . After 2 days I decided to change hotel and go in a more peaceful one . Rooms are very nice but long check in ..never again",3
"The hotel was good, the garden's view was breathtaking, the only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the crowds.. Maybe because December is a high season!? During check in, it felt like we were waiting at the supermarket line. The pool view was amazing, but it was crowded too lol  The hotel services were fast though and they have a lot of restaurants and shops. The hotel is linked to a mall called The Shoppes"" it's huge and beautiful. You can also access the Sky Park which is located on top of the hotel for free as a hotel resident. The Gardens by the Bay are a walk a way from the hotel too, A must visit garden.  ",4
"5 star hotel. Service more like 2 star some budget hotel. The guy name started with ""ce.."" something. Served the few japanese ladies infront with smiles and all. After when its our turn, he realized we were local singaporeans and kept a straight face and rude tone. Tskk dissapointing.",2
"Yes, the Marina Bay Sands is expensive but oh so worth it. The view from our room was breathtaking. The hotel is modern and clean. It's on the metro as well as connect to a shopping center, casino and the Gardens on the Bay. The infinity pool and hot tubs were great. ",5
"Service not personalized as in some other hotels. Need to warm up the pool, freezing at the time you get in.  Don'f forget to carry your passport if want to try some luck at the casino. Rooms ok but no surprise prepared for honeymooners so if you expect something, better think and stay somewhere else.",4
"This was a very special holiday, was to celebrate my husband's 60th Birthday, we had seen reviews of The Marina Bay sands and we were very impressed. When we booked in at reception we were told we had been upgraded in our room and just thought well so we should be for the price, never in our wildest dreams did we expect to be upgraded to a suite, was bigger than our 2 bedroom unit when we were first married.Absolutely beautiful, complete with bath tub. The infinity pool on the roof is fabulous, staff were lovely especially our friends in the club, who went out of their way to make my husbands Birthday so very special,Thank you all.",5
"Although not an ultimate frontier of hotel luxury it is a very modern and iconic place not to be missed. We opted for a suite and enjoyed separate checks in area, private elevator, private sky deck pool entrance, club members restaurants with brunches, high teas and a likes. Our suite was an intelligent home type one with automatically adjusted curtain and temperature and shades depending on the time of day and sun angle. Great amenities and toiletries. Stay here and you won't regret although their customer service misses the personal touch and exquisiteness of other less iconic still luxury hotels in Singapore.",5
"Top hotel, with 3 towers, huge luxury rooms, amazing views, pool on 57 floor, restaurants, extraordinary customer service, decor. Perfect location in Bay Area with access to Singapore Gardens and huge shopping centre. We could use the shower facilities after check out/before our flight to Australia. Highly recommended.",5
"This hotel is spectacular! The whole experience was just perfect and really enjoyable! From breakfast on the roof top, the night club and bars it just a great experience! Of course much of our time was spent in the pool and the weather was perfect during our stay! The hotel experience was luxurious, with a relaxed, carefree and anything is possible attitude. Can't wait to go back next time in Singapore! ",5
"Fantastic hotel with all the usual excellence and quality you would expect in hotel of this  caliber. Check in is 3pm but I had no problem checking in at 12 noon. Stayed 39 floor with spectacular city views and very large, well appointed room. Huge glass wall in bedroom is perfect for watching the waterfront laser light shows (8pm and 930pm nightly).   The Infinity Pool on top (57th floor) is the biggest draw card and deservedly so. Truly terrific way to spend hours in the pool overlooking Singapore. Be warned it is very hot and only limited seating in shade. Great snack menu and bar service at pool area but also other restaurants up there for those who want a more formal eating experience. Quite expensive but really that is Singapore all over. (The only cheap things in…",5
"Oh wow...I dont know what to write about this hotel. Its been a dream stay here.  Yes...This was an best ever Hotel and hospitality i ever got. I checked in a little early , which Hotel management allowed me very gracefully. And the best part was room up gradation on their own, was unbelievable. This was the best a customer can get this hotel without any extra charge. They gave on their own. At 51st Floor in Tower 1 with direct access to famous Infinity pool, Garden by bay facing. Amazing food, amazing staff, amazing place. Very comfortable, whole family enjoyed.  This Hotel inspite of being so huge with around over 20 receptionist in front desk doing check in at a time, still they were so polite, calm, and very sweet i must say. Room service was too good Infinity pool which is…",5
"Bridal suite was great, they have provided good service and premium service team was thoughtful and made us feel important during our stay. The banquet team was amazing and minimised our stress for wedding event.",5
I booked an Orchard Suite for myself and  Family total 4 .On arrival priority check in was Excellent and Quick and on my request I was given room with a spectacular view. The suite itself is Grand and Very comfortable . Above all extra bedding for my 11 year son and fruit basket made us felt the amount of care the Administration takes for the guests. The tea and juice at club 55 is awesome. All staff and arrangements outstanding. I would certainly like to come back and stay here again In Sha Allah and would recommend it to all my fellows. Moreover the Swimming Pool at top and Observation Deck is also Spectacular. Great Shopping Centres and Restaurants below the Hotel provide best opportunity for Shopping and Dinning too.,5
"My first time at the MBS Hotel for a company convention and I'm blown off!  There are 3 separate towers for this hotel and they are linked at the first floor and at the roof.  Across the road from the hotel section are the huge Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre, Casino and (medium to high-end) shopping mall, which can be accessed through multiple covered links (lined with high-end shops).  There is even direct access to the subway, and to the Gardens by the Bay.  Accessibility:  10 (out of 5) ☆  Check-in:  There are 2 check-in reception areas - at Tower 1 and Tower 3.  Tower 1 reception area serves as the main check-in area and is big.  Check-in was very smooth.  The hotel staff seemed used to big groups.  Room:  I was assigned to Tower 3, on a mid-twenty floor and facing the…",5
"We stayed for 2 nights here. The views are excellent and the views are fantastic. We booked a club room and it was upgraded to a city view suite, a fantastic experience. Standing at the full length window on the 51st floor was great looking out over looking Marina Bay. The light show at nights was fantastic from this vantage point. The club rooms are worth any extra $s as the club on floor 55 is excellent to relax in for breakfast and after a day's sightseeing. The staff were both helpful, friendly and efficient. The hotel is a 'super hotel' and although everyone is friendly there is a lack of contact, just due to the sheer size of the hotel. The infinity pool is excellent as are the restaurants on that floor; there are lifeguards on duty and the adult only area is enforced,…",5
"Service was great and staff were so friendly. Loved how the blinds opened every time you entered your room just to remind you of what a great view you had! The infinity pool was amazing! Busy, but people are always coming and going so it was never a problem to get a lounger. Service was a bit slow to get a drink/snack by the pool.   It is worth visiting the buffet restaurant in tower 1 - it has absolutely everything you could wish for and the food is really good quality!  Overall, a stunning hotel that has great service! Would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore to stay here - what an experience!",5
"I guess a lot of things was written here before. The pool, the gardens in front..close to the shopping mall.. etc.  But the service, if you need anything special, the response time for the breakfast to get it on the room and so on.. is amazing. The best: You don't see it, you just get everything you want and need. You don't get the stressful support which is needed to support this big number of guests to the surface.. For a hotel this size its really amazing..  Further everybody is kind and always supportive...",5
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 3 days in January 2016 off the back of a trip to Australia. Firstly, this hotel is massive.  The ground floor lobby is enormous but there again it does cover 3 tower blocks. We booked a City View Club Room and were directed to Tower 3.  The room was oversized and the luggage arrived pretty promptly.  It certainly had everything we could want in a hotel room and the view was amazing. The swimming pool is fabulous to see.  The view is amazing of the city and my wife and I enjoyed watching the dozens of people taking their selfies day in and day out. We used the Club Room most days.  Breakfast was very good with a wide selection, afternoon tea was disappointing, just a couple of scones and hardly any cakes and no sandwiches.  Canopees looked…",5
"Of course is known as one of the most beautiful infinity pool ever, which somehow might be true. Is just toooo crowded, of course too many people going in there just because of that. Anyway, on the pictures looks much more bigger than it actually is, but is nice to chill with a drink while enjoying the view. It was also a bit polluted so we didn't have that great view. The room is nice but the stuff a bit unfriendly and in general i found this hotel too expensive for what it really gives (they didn't even want to give me a small bottle of water more in the room, i had to wait for the cleaning service otherwise they would have charged double price..come on..it was a small bottle of water..not a glass of gold)",4
"For the amount of money we are paying for the room, it's not worth it. The room was plain nothing extraordinary. Guess we are paying a premium for the view and pool. Our friend told us to upgrade to club room so we can enjoy the free breakfast, and tea time. But I didn't think it was worth it. I can eat better food at the mall food court. Just pay for the basic room, its not like youre going to staying the room 24/7. The pool was really nice, it's a must see! So many people were in the pool so its harder to get nice pictures. Too bad it was raining everyday so we didnt get a sunny pic at the pool. There's plenty of nice restaurant in this hotel, so you can pick and choose fine dining or food court food. The casino was large and packed with Baccarat Tables. I""m not a gambler so…",4
"Everything about this place is ready to blow your mind. Great food, great service, unbeliaveble views.",5
"The best part is the infinity pool on top, one of unique experience everyone should have, having all the views of singapore both city and sea side but did not expect to be crowded during the afternoon up to sunset. Better to go during sunrise to get the best spot and have plenty of space to move around and take pictures. Rooms are the usual top business hotels have, big beds, but nothing great or exceptional but we had a great view of the gardens by the bay. Location is also convenient, mrt is near and malls and restaurants are easily accessible.",4
"Eat, shop and be entertained is why I go to Singapore as a tourist and Marina Bay Sands has the best of these.  Not just one or two great restaurants, shops and shows but a lot so there's really no reason to leave the place!  Their infinity pool is the only place to be in Singapore on New Year's Eve; stunning view of the city, great music with the best looking international crowd you could be with while having some Singapore slings and you see the magnificent light shows and fireworks at eye level by the pool's edge!  So many wonderful food choices and they do make shopping fun here too with those blue or gold cards.  The rooms are just to rest in between eating and shopping or to rest those tired feet after a visit to the museum or the gardens by the bay.  Marina Bay Sands also…",5
"I came here to work for couple days in November, fortunately right after the haze was all gone. Check-in was fairly straight-forward and was a breeze, though the walk from Tower 1 to 3 (where I stayed) could be a bit far! It didnt take long for the escalator to reach 34th floor where my room was. It is right at the middle of the building where the lower and higher floor escalators meet. To reach the city-famous roof-top pool, lower-level guests would need to either make a change of lift on 34th floor or bottom, which can be a bit of inconvenience if you were going to wear swimsuits (you will) to there. My room was facing the sea and garden - a great quiet view, while others would get the cityscape view which was equally fascinating. There's a balcony which you could walk out to…",4
"Great service, great views, beautiful rooms, restaurants on top r spectacular, fitness center, spa and incredible infinity pool. While working all day and many options to stay fit, healthy and be outside with the best views of Singapore!",5
I stayed here for two nights because it was close to the Sentosa Island attractions and yet it was close enough via taxi or Metro to the rest of town. Special thanks goes to Gerard at check-in for securing two amazing rooms for my family (wife and kids - 17 and 15yrs).  Yes we would/will stay there again. Architecturally magnificent - a standout from most places in Singapore from a tourist's viewpoint. Service is second to none. The Infinity pool and Skypark both dazzle the  eyes with all they have to offer from 57 floors up. Breath-takingingly spectacular.  The associated shopping precinct with all the labels you could want at your door. Shop till you drop ladies and gentlemen.  ,5
"This place is my home away from home. I stay here at least once per year. MBS is really all about the iconic, amazing pool. The views from the top are absolutely incredible!!  The rooms itself 'tick all the boxes' and are luxurious, but don't have too much personality. It's the building itself which makes MBS so special.  You can easily walk to Gardens by the Bay, I highly recommend the Cloud Forest dome. I also love eating at Satay by the Bay hawker centre. (I've never eaten at the hotel as it's expensive, but there is a great variety of food available). The gym & spa facilities are of a high standard and also with great views.  There are a lot of 5-star hotels in Singapore, but you must stay here once!",5
Room was very comfortable and spacious. Had a beautiful view of the Singapore Giant Trees. The swimming pool on the terrace is amazing. Bars and restaurants are great. I had access to the club lounge and they offered many meals a day on the terrace. Great experience on the city.,5
"Just a quick one.  While the premium view room has nice view and up to par in terms of spaciousness and automated blind etc (like a typical Vegas hotel), the most amazing thing is definitely the infinity pool - photo ops plus the feeling of just soaking in the water and looking out to see the whole city under you.  The disappointment is definitely the Spago bar - maybe we should not have gone there since we stayed at the hotel - guess it was mostly for people who wanted to see the view without staying at the hotel.  >S$30 for a cocktail that is not very good at all - I assumed that Spago had a decent mixologist if they charged that kind of price and I was wrong - not recommended.  We also went to the Sky bar which surprisingly had some good food when we wanted an afternoon…",4
"This was definitely one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in! Of course you're paying the price for it, but it was still such a cool experience. We got a free upgrade since we were celebrating our honeymoon which made things even better!  The pool truly was epic. Just be warned that it does get crowded. Each person will need a key to get in, so make sure to get enough keys for however many people are staying in your room.  The viewing deck on the other side was also super cool. Guests get to check it out free!   If I could afford it, I'd definitely try to stay again or at least go back to check out the hotel and mall that's connected across the street. The staff was all very friendly and we had no issues at all with our stay.",5
"It is very convenient, with taxi stands outside and the Underground train behind (at least that's what I needed to get around SG). The architecture of the building is amazing, apparently it has some Feng Shui influence on it. The pool is spectacular, with a wonderful view and it was big enough to cater for the crowd. The gym is well-equipped with facilities and also has a magnificent view. The night view is fantastic as well! I would definitely go again!",4
"My friends and I went up there for drinks and to see what everyone has been bragging about. We were not in the least bit disappointed. The view is without a doubt something to experience at least once. To top it all, the service was 5 star and even though we only one drink each cos it was a bit pricey, we were treated so well. The staff were polite and because the cover charge starts after 9.30pm they did not shoo us off but were so diplomatic in the way they conveyed that the sitting area was reserved and that we would have to vacate it after 9.30am. You would never get this kind of hospitality in Malaysia, sad to say. It was truly a warm visit and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Definitely a highlight. Very friendly helpful person. A special cheers to him. Furthermore, I would like to especially thank for all staf - wonderful service from them all. We stayed at Kamar Premier. All of them a delight and to top it - the food. It was simply amazing. super amazing top infinity swimming pool. The experience was wonderful as well.",5
Only went as we wanted to eat at a restaurant to celebrate an occasion. Not worth paying a fee to see the view.,4
"My husband and I visited the marina bay sands before I gave birth to my 3rd child. We thoroughly enjoyed staying in this opulent hotel. Perfectly positioned right in the heart of Singapore. Such an amazing restaurant located on the very roof of the hotel. Great drinks, service and food!   There was also an amazing underground shopping mall that was just Devine.   I look forward to hopefully staying again and bringing my kids next time.",5
"We decided to stay here and treat ourselves to break up the long haul to NZ from Paris.  A great decision - the location and the pool made it brilliant for the kids.  We got a room upgrade to an enormous room with a balcony.  The free light show is amazing, the breakfast buffet is astounding, and the room service was so good we didn't go anywhere else!  It is busy, but the staff are well equipped to manage this.  Would definitely come again.",5
For a 5 star hotel there are a few things missing.  Mbs is large and has many rooms.  The pool is good for a photo opportunity and that is it.  We looked at the water and it is dirty.   The amenities such as shampoo are very standard almost like a 3 or 4 star hotel.    The rooms are nice and handy. ,3
Its one of my faviorit Hotel I ever been .. Amazing building from out side looking and article from in side I like it . once you Enter the Hotel You Feel Like a famous Person . Great welcome and nice room too .. The give me a Room on Floor 47 Incredibleview from the window ..,5
"We were upgraded to a high-floor premiere room with a city view! If you can stay longer in your room, do it. Check the window day and night to enjoy the view. We loved the amenities especially the infinity pool and gym. It's accessibility to tourist spots and train station made our stay easier.",4
"The marina bay definitely has the best view in Singapore and some very nice rooms on the high up levels along with one of the greatest pools around the world... However, the service due to the size is not the greatest and lacks the special feeling you get when you are being looked after overseas. ",5
5* views and standard of room is excellent and definitely 5* We stayed for a night in mid January as part of our honeymoon before we went to the airport the following day  It was very busy and as all rooms are high the lifts were always busy  We are glad we did it to say we've been but wouldn't stay again as it was too big and busy  The infinity pool and sky bar were amazing but again very busy  ,4
"Lets face it ... well you almost always do in Singapore, most people stay at this hotel  for the infinity pool and the new amenities, or to experience being in a hotel which is more like three. Unfortunately many people will be slightly disappointed after their stay here or it did not match their personal expectations, due to a number of factors: busyness, cost, depth of the pool etc. Just about all the time there a tourists taking photos of themselves in the infinity pool, most lounge chairs are taken and it is difficult to have a relaxing time at the top. The pools themselves is pretty boring, only being 1.2m deep which is a misconception from some advertising posters and pictures, however the view from it cannot be faulted. Rooms are pretty pricey and you can hear the busy…",3
"This hotel is AMAZING. I recommend spending the extra dollars and staying at this luxurious hotel. We stayed for two nights and had a city view. Watching the sunset over the city was beautiful from either your room, the bar on top or the infinity pool. The infinity pool is probably the best part about this hotel. I would seriously recommend staying here a east once in your life time and feeling like kings and queens!",5
"We spent one night in this hotel, It was a great experience! Totally different cause the hotel is huge even-though the service is great.    The pool is amazing but it's cold, we spent a great afternoon at the pool and enjoy the view that is incredible!!!  The room is really nice and clean, it's big and it also has a great view.",5
"Maybe because this hotel is too big and there are a lot of tourists checking in & out day & night, but I felt that most of the staff seem unfriendly and always in a hurry.   The hotel rooms are just ok - basic comfortable pillows & mattress. My expectations were high since it is THE Marina Bay Sands after all, right?  What I like about this hotel is THE AMAZING VIEW and the TWG teas in the mini bar!!!  The breakfast buffet is very good, although as expected, there are a lot of people & there's always a line. I am glad that the food servers here are cheerful.   I enjoyed hanging out at the rooftop and its infinity pool. I would like to commend the management for being strict at the entrance. One person = one room key policy. Best place to watch the sunset. Best place to take a…",4
"Short walk from Gardens by The Bay you'll stumbled upon Marina Bay everyone seems to be excited about and yes the excitements delivered if you go up to the top, swim in the pool, enjoy the corner bar or perhaps cruise around in one of the small boat inside the Marina Bay mall. Yes, they do installed an indoor canal inside the mall.  Other than that, the place looks great from outside for its architecture, but inside is bland. I don't like gambling unless it's working and casual gambling is not for me, the place is actually great for that, but just wasn't for me.  Mall is great, all of the world's best brands are here then again so would in other premium malls across the globe.",3
"This is a top 5-star hotel with resort style Hotel, Restaurants, Bars, Clubs, Shopping, Casino, etc built across a huge Marina Bay compound. We booked directly to the hotel. Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade of King+sofa bed room, which is generous size for a family of 4 with young kids.   The room amenity is good, furnishing were new and bathroom was amazing. Room tips, try to get the city view for breathtaking view of Singapore skyline (the sea view may get the Garden by the Bay view but won't be as nice as city view). You can see the Merlion square across the city view rooms over the Marina Bay, you can even walk there (1.6km walk).  As a hotel guest you get exclusive access for Infinity Pool (you will require a keycard for every occupant including kids! - as they are…",4
"This is a beautiful hotel, with the best infinity pool I have been to.  The location is awesome, with an unparalleled view of Singapore.  It is definitely pricey, with a Singapore Sling going for Singapore $22 pool-side; however, you're paying for the setting.  Service was great, and we had a relatively easy time changing our reservations late in the game.  However, we were there over Christmas, and it was quite crowded...check-in took about 45 minutes.  The hotel is near a wonderful shopping center with many restaurant choices, and Gardens By The Bay are also within walking distance.  All in all, a nice but expensive stay in Singapore.",5
"We got garden view room, the room was clean and big enough for my fam. All the hotel facilities are luxury. The infinity pool definitely so amazing. But compare to others hotel the price is quite expensive. If you plan to have shopping this is the good one to stay. Morning and night will give you different view but both are so beautiful. The staffs also so helpful.",5
" Stayed at MBS in December and had a great week with family in Orchard Suite with City views and what a view! Very friendly and extremely helpful staff. Probably the best service ever and we've stayed in most of the world's premier resorts and hotels. The hotel staff are just the most courteous, polite and helpful people I've encountered. Great selection for buffet breakfast on ground floor restaurant, but it's too crowded. Besides why not have the slightly smaller variety on 57 floor restaurant but with great views! Definitely returning.",5
"Best hotel to go to in SG, stunning views of both the city & sea at the view deck, their pool is at the view deck also where you can swim while enjoying the view, very pricey & not recommended for budget travelers, room was spacious with balcony you can go to MBS mall for shopping & casino if your feeling lucky.",4
2nd time visit to MBA since it first opened. I found it had no personal touch and lacked the detail that is normally associated with 5 star hotels. It is a 5 star pool. A 4 star hotel and perhaps a 2 star service. In fact possibly up there with one of the worst serviced hotels I've been to.  Let's start off with the inconsistency. The pool has a great kids area. A family area and a adults only area. Can't fault that. But where is the facility for family to feed kids. I was horrified when eating in the restaurant lounge at the top. I asked for a bit of milk to put in my babies bottle and was charged 12 dollars for it. What was worse was they didn't mention there would be a charge. They refused to put it directly in a bottle. Plus they gave it to me in a tea cup. When I complained…,1
"I stayed here for 2 nights and next time it will be longer. The views are breath-taking, the rooms and bathrooms are suitably luxurious.   The staff were fantastic, in particular Kateline at reception who was welcoming friendly and informative.   The bar on the top floor does beautiful cocktails, the pool is fantastic. This hotel was more than we would usually spend on a hotel but it was worth every penny. Can’t wait to return.",5
"Positive point: 1-	Wonderful hotel. Amazing outside looking and inside as well.  2-	Fantastic swimming pool with great view 3-	The metro inside the hotel and the mall too. 4-	Connected way to beautiful place in Singapore. Planets world. 5-	Great service & helpful stuff. 6-	Big room in floor 47 awesome view to the lake. Disappoint: 1-	No dryer machine in room. If you visit Singapore and didn’t stay at less 1 night in this hotel.. You miss a lot of Singapore .. This hotel defiantly one of my best hotels.",5
"I guess this is one of the ""to do things"" when visiting Singapore. Really, the only reason to stay here are the pool and the views. There are other hotels in Singapore that offer a service just as good or better... For people who want a 5 star hotel experience this must be somewhat a letdown since this place is overcrowded with tourists staying here for a night just to be able to go to the pool and take selfies. It really depends on what you are looking for. Of course, the hotel rooms are very big and the view from your bedroom is spectacular. So if the rooftop pool and the views are worth the price for you, this is the place to be. I am glad I stayed here but I don't think I would come back. Location is good. Thanks to the guys from the luggage storage, they were great!",4
"had a 2d1n stay with my fiance here to celebrate our anniversary. the views from the hotel room and the sky park were breath taking. the hotel room was extremely comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay here. staff were friendly and polite as well, making the stay even more pleasant :) will definitely return again. ",5
"such a beautiful experience! wonderful view wonderful place! everyone should go there!  we went there many times i love the bar and the pool on top! drinks are so good it's perfect for couple, friend or family.",5
"Lovely looking hotel, but difficult to navigate. Different towers give you access to different facilities. The infinity pool is great but few swim in it -it must have the highest selfie rate in the world. I have stayed there twice and it always seems  to be very crowded. Eating options are limited and expensive. There are better accommodation options available for cheaper rates.",4
"The rooftop pool alone makes this an easy 5 star review, the staff up there were attentive and the cocktails were great. The room we stayed in overlooked the botanic gardens and we saw the show from above, we ordered room service and a nice older chap served us and gave us a brief overview of his local area. The prices were not even that bad considering how popular it is. If you go to Singapore I would say don't miss out.",5
"We stayed here for a night and really enjoyed it. Room size was big and we had a nice city view. It was awesome that the curtains opened automatically when you open the door. It is a very busy hotel with long queues at check in/out. The lobby is bustling all the time. We also had fun swimming at the infinity pool, which offered great view of the city. I think the breakfast buffet was a disappointment. The food was average for the price (SG$98 for two).",5
"So yes, this place is expensive, we paid approx. £400 for one night with a late c heck out, BUT it is well worth it. The roof top pool is out of this world and everyone should experience it. Unfortunately out time there was a little spoilt by building work which was going on at the time and which was very noisy. Also, if the weather is good and the sun is out, get up there early to get a lounger, otherwise you can be waiting a while for one. The food and drinks are expensive but you expect that...and the quality is good so....The rooms are huge and it is definitely worth paying a little extra for a city/marina view room. The scale of the whole hotel is breath-taking and definitely worth a visit.",5
Amazing views and a light show all viewed from the Infinity Pool at Marina Bay Sands was one of the things I will always remember. Expensive  even by Singapore standards but a once in a lifetime experience and highly recommended.,5
Very satisfied with our hotel stay. We stayed at the suite room. I love the theatre room and the bathroom. The view was also very good as you can see the Gardens by the Bay :) Infinity pool was also good but a little bit crowded. The Filipina staff was so friendly and nice. I will definitely go back to this place.,5
"Nice room size with clean and comfortable beds, pool was crowded with very nice view and design.  the rate was expensive so its better to stay for short time in this hotel.  There is marina mall connected to the hotel but there is no cinema and fast food in this mall.",5
Friend and I booked 2 suite with club membership at over AUD700 per night during Jan 2016.  Room was great but service was not good experience. We reserved room under 1 name we checked in and paid with 2 credit cards.  After paid and checkedin i was known and referred to by the served name... Interesting.  I also find the service of floor staff very average for such fancy hotel.  The Express Service and bellboy was very friendly however the others need alot of improvement including staff at infinity  poor. ,3
This hotel really bring you to a finest five star room. compare with other hotel in Singapore that i've stayed in. the city view during the night just awesome. The room was spacey. really love the room.,5
I am very glad that I stayed in this property when I visited Singapore recently and felt top of the world staying in this hotel which needs no explanation.  Marina Bay Hotel itself is a important destination in Singapore where people come to see the lavish facilities and the architecture of this Hotel. The rooms of this hotel were very good in every sense and whichever floor you stay you just reach the ground level so fast due to their best lift facilities felt like i am in any tower like Alburj dubai or Petronas Malaysia for example.. so fast and the best.  If you stay in this property you can simply go for shopping in the same vicinity which has all the best brands available in the world.. There are gardens around you and you can simply walk out for taxis and roam around…,5
"Booked this on recommendation of my client in Singapore.  Stayed for 3 days at the end of my trip with my wife at the end of my business trip.  Booked an Orchid Suite.  The good - Some of the best hotel staff I have encountered in my travels.  We were in Tower 2 with a Marina Bay view.  The included Club access gave us Breakfast, afternoon tea & snacks and evening drinks and appetizers/snacks.  Food was of excellent quality.  Well appointed fitness center.  Banyan tree spa was top notch and staff skilled.  The rooftop area really has some spectacular views of Singapore.  The bad - really not that much, more personal taste that bad.  The place is enormous so if you are looking for cozy this is not the place.  The pool was very nice but crowded with lots of kids so relaxing in the…",4
"This is a 5 star+ experience, filled with constant delight and surprises. The architecture amazes, the stunning views, the amenities and service. WOW! We'll go back for sure. Singapore is a wonderful destination, a perfect blend of holidaying, site seeing, shopping and eating. The MBS is the cherry on top. ",5
"Gorgeous Hotel in Singapore. It has nice view and staffs, I love infinity pool but there are lot of people, this place is convenience to go to anywhere because it's near MRT and it's near shopping center",5
"An amazing building with wonderful views of a beautiful location. We quite enjoyed being out of the city, still plenty of shops and places to eat in the area. Our room was lovely, beautiful view of the gorgeous gardens all lit up at night. Wonderful and clean, thanks to Wang Xin! The structure was amazing to experience especially from the 57th floor (right at the top) the pool is just gorgeous with beautiful views out towards the city.   While the building has much to offer, I feel the staff and the information in the rooms need to be more informative. I was traveling with my mum and we spent half our time there asking people what floor things were on and where to go for breakfast and where and how to get to things within the building as it is separated into 3 towers. We had to…",4
"Stayed in a Grand Club Room, with Garden view which was fantastic. The room was huge and being a corner room, also had some views of the City.   The room was spotless and everyone at the hotel was efficient and helpful.  Loved the infinity pool and even when busy, seemed to have space for everyone.  Location was great as I didn't want to stay in the heart of the City, but easy to travel in by cab, bus or MRT.   The Club Lounge was one of the best I have used, with all the staff being extremely helpful and attentive. The food was great with lots of choice.  I would totally recommend a stay here if your are visiting Singapore.",5
"Having been recommended by a friend to stay in this hotel, I can honestly say, after travelling extensively around the world, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.   From the welcome by the Bell Boys, to receptionist and club Lounge staff, everyone was so welcoming, helpful and friendly. The service was excellent and the range of food in the club Lounge was fantastic.  Evening Canapés, were great and the inclusive drinks (Such as cognac) were the finest I have had in hotel lounges and far better than in most other hotels I have used.  The location was great being out of the City, but close enough to get to see around it by cab and tour bus.   The roof top infinity pool is amazing, especially at night with the City alight. The pool attendants are as friendly and…",5
"Stayed here for 2 nights on a stopover enroute to Australia. The hotel is quite overwhelming when you first arrive. Massive atrium, large queues at reception and 1000s of people buzzing about. We arrived at about 0930 and wasn't really expecting to get our room so early however we only had to wait about 90 minutes so the service was excellent. We had a city view room on the 43rd floor. The room was big with all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The bathroom was large with bath, double shower etc. As well as being a hotel you also have access (as a guest) to the fantastic infinity pool on the 57th floor. This affords views across the city whilst on the other side you have great views of The Gardens at the Bay. The CeLaVie bar is worth a visit for stunning sunset…",4
"The hotel is an architectural marvel to begin with, the rooms luxurious and spacey, views breath taking. Pool on top with sonabath is awesome! Gives wonderful view of the entire city. There are plenty amenities in this hotel makes you spent sleepless night living there :)  Planning to visit again!",5
"Firstly, congratulations on building a milestone building but unfortunately it is nothing more than a tourist attraction with theme park crowds and mentality all competing for their slice of what they paid for. Over crowded pool with a 15 minute wait to find a deck chair. Selfie sticks in your face all day in and out of the water as everyone tries to capture their status photo to share on social media. The foyer and front desk resembles any central railway station of similar traffic. The concierge will never have a hope in hell remembering your face or name. And good luck getting a late check out as they only offer you an extra hour but that doesn't matter because your security key locks you out early anyway of which you will need to go back to reception for the hour long cue to…",3
"A very pleasant and wonderful experience and the view towards the city especially at night was just so beautiful. As far as city views go, has to be my favourite and what more can I can, facilities are top notch.  Infinity Pool which is the name of the swimming pool I believe is truly an experience one shan't forget.  Then again, it's Singapore after all and I must say could possibly be her best.",5
"The Sky Park infinity pool is breathtaking, you would think it's a Boracay (Philippines) more than 50 floors above the ground. The gym is big enough that it's never crowded despite the great number of rooms. All these amenities are exclusive to hotel guests as these are accessible only to holders of room key cards. Been here to this hotel four times before but this is the first time I stayed in a room",5
"Stayed here for business and was lucky to be given a room on a high floor with a bay view in tower 2 (middle tower). The rooms are well presented, of good size and come with all the sockets and USB charging you could need.  join the Sands rewards scheme on arrival to get free high speed internet but also good discounts on restaurants and shops in the centre. Visit the infinity pool in the roof garden. I found if you get there as it opens in the morning it is much quieter than at other times. The rise bar in the lobby was good value for an excellent buffet although there are many other options available throughout the hotel. An excellent example of  5 star accomodation I hope to visit again.",5
"We stopped in Sinagpore on our flight to Syndey and stayed here, the hotel is very large and well organised. We can not fault the hotel but it is not the type of hotel we normally stay in and so felt a little ""processed"" which on reflection had to be the case due to its size. That said our room was excellent and having e-mailed the hotel before our arrival mentioning our early arrival time the staff were able to allocate us our room early which we appricated. The hotel is well located and the Sky Garden is fabulous, one concern was whether the Sky Garden would be full of sightseers but this was not the case as the bulk of the area is for residents alone.",4
"I stayed at this wonderful hotel only for one night, but that was sufficient to draw a conclusion: if am even in Singapore again, this is where I will stay. The hotel is an architectural marvel to begin with, the rooms luxurious and spacey, views breathtaking. The moment I stepped in the room and entered my key card, curtains slowly parted, presenting me with a stunning city view. The room was equipped with absolutely everything one could wish for in a great hotel, including fabulous bathroom fitted with all necessities, comfy settee to enjoy the view from and a king size bed good enough for fairy tale princess. I am not going to mention complimentary water, cordial room service and the in-room dining options. Hotel boasts the infinity pool and a world class restaurant as a…",5
Stayed in the Sands Suite after my wedding and the suite was great for the after party with my friends. The large and spacious open rooms allowed for everyone to see everyone and the fun aspects such as the large communal dining table for big suppers as well as a pool table in the room made it lots of fun. The in-room bar counter also made it easy to keep the drinks flowing... If you're looking for a party room. This is it. :),4
"This place is enormous, from the distance it looks like Stonehenge but up close it is an awesome masterpiece of engineering and architecture. Viewed from the gardens for the first time I was amazed at the sheer size of it. Checked in for 2 nights between Christmas and New Year. The check-in experience is appalling, lined up for at least half an hour in the main lobby amounst the tourists and guests walking around you, and when you finally get to the front you have to produce not only your credit card but passports as well. Thought I had already paid but hadn't, so then assumed that I was paying on check-in, and then on check out they ask for the credit card again and thats when you are charged-very confusing system. If you do not want to be charged for anything in the minibar,…",4
"I stayed in Marina Bay Sands Dec. 2015. It was a exciting stay bcuz i had all what i want inside the hotel. The shopping malls, good restaurant, the casino & the pool. Though the room was not that extravagant, it was beautiful & clean. The view from my room was nice that i couldn't help but to take pics a lot. Their Infinity Pool was fantastic it seems like you can see the half of Singapore from there. Nice experience. Nothing great hotel to stay if you want to look at Singapore from the top than Marina Bay Sands. ",5
"Had a 3rd times stay here...1st deluxe room, quite small for one of the most expensive hotel in the world, 2nd n third we stayed at Club room, with spacious room n bath room, very comfortable...Great Hotel, friendly staf, you wont find any complain here....everything was just great, will coming back.",5
"I only spent one night here before the Singapore Grand Prix in September 2015, but worth reviewing for the sheer height of the hotel reception area. The space is vast and the height of the atrium roof quite amazing. We had a very nice room with a brilliant view over the bay and the standard was very good. Unfortunately as we were only there one night we did not have a chance to use any facilities. However we tried to eat at the restaurant on the top of the hotel but we were not allowed in as they have to swipe both room cards and we only had one with us. We could not be bothered to go back to the room and back again to the restaurant so we had room service instead. I thought this was a bit petty as the computer would show that we were staying in the same room!! We did have a…",5
"Marina Bay Sands (MBS) Hotel provided the very best of a luxury hotel in Singapore. My previous 14 stays were at another hotel in the Scotts/ Orchard Road area, with emphasis on a business environment. The MBS Hotel is much larger and does pose additional challenges with check in wait time. This may be reduced by enrolling as a preferred guest. Overall a outstanding experience, and a must see for all traveling to Singapore.",5
"Our final destination and a final tick in the book ""swim in the highest outdoor pool in the world""..well speechless! A sheer feat to build this stunning hotel. check-in was rather manic, but once through it. the hotel is unbeatable in design and service. We did not sleep the first night deciding to stay up on the top floor until the sun rose. A well appointed bedroom and bathroom with great restaurants and shopping mall.   We did venture out to the fabalous park opposite and into down-town Singapore. Rather pricey but well worth it. Have since been back for a two night stay for the Grand Prix.",5
"It's ok for the infinity pool, the spacious rooms and the views from there, but... no breakfast (you have to pay for it if you stay on some kind of rooms), the lifts were almost always overcrowded and last too much time to stop at the 32nd floor where I stayed, the room services that were paid were overpriced for the quality, internet was not so good and you must pay for a better quality connection... Vale pela piscina e pelas vistas que se tem do quarto, mas... não há café da manhã, de acordo com a categoria do quarto escolhida, os elevadores estavam sempre lotados e demoravam muito para chegar até o 32 andar onde me hospedei, os serviços de quarto pagos eram muito caros para a qualidade oferecida, a internet não funciona muito bem e, para se ter uma qualidade melhor, há que…",3
"Beautiful hotel with everything you need! Close to the garden by the bay and a fabulous mall. The 56th and 57th floor is like candy for you eye.. Every night is there a light show, best place to see it if you go to the other side, close to the Fullerton hotel!  Don't miss this place..",5
"We stayed at the Marina Bay for just one night before our cruise with our two teenage boys and arrived after a long flight at 7.20 am in the morning expecting for them to store our cases until sometime in the afternoon at a more reasonable time, however the receptionist was extremely helpful and offered an upgrade (at only 30$ more) and these rooms where both interconnecting and fabulous, one of the best bathrooms we've ever had. We went up to the amazing infinity pool for a few hours and later on in the day had cocktails and club sandwiches whilst enjoying the breath taking view over Singapore. in the evening as we were rather tired we opted for the buffet dinner which offered an amazing range of food including oyster bars, sushi and other unexpected options. After dinner we…",5
"For once, at least one day in your life is worth trying!Excellent placement in Marina Bay area,Gardens by the Bay.Superaccesorized room and bathroom.And the infinite pool?Hot towels and what a view...",5
"Obviously a great set up and still one of the must see structures in the world. However as a 'Hotel' this place left so much to be desired still! Perhaps due to the size of its set up it is simply too big to provide good service in any way, our stay felt more like staying in 'shopping mall' rather than a 5 star hotel. Inclusive breakfast was also rather similar to a 'cantine' with longish queues on all 3 mornings at any counter.  The most truly disappointing was the sky garden/pool. I would recomend for anyone not to actually visit this part as it will completely shatter your illusion about such amazing concept! again simply too crowded and utterly disorgenised, resembled a busy 'bus terminal' more than anything else. with used towels everywhere and unattended too, strange…",3
"It was a great 3 nights stay in MBS.. We were at 47th floor in tower 3, and facing to garden by bay. It's giving us a great view. The service was also magnificent, although it's quite pricey (since our visit was peak season) $450ish per night without breakfast, but we still recommended this hotel.",5
I spent lot of time reading reviews before making reservation... however was very upset with the service.. very poor service for the price .... paid almost 470USD/night. However the service was no better than a hotel with 100 USD..Hence  i will not recommend anyone to stay here.  The pool was an experience.,3
Yes the pool area is amazing but for the price of the rooms here we really expected better service.  Room was also very good with a fabulous view over the Marina.  We stayed for the FI and really had a good time and this was within walking distance to the track.  Although getting back to the hotel after the event was a bit difficult as they had shut some exits!,4
"Big nice and very clean room. They upgraded us to a city view room and the view was breathtaking. it totally worth paying a little extra to have the city view on the harbour!   The staff was incredible. Especially at the pool, they were always so friendly with us and definitely made our stay even more special.  The hotel itself is just so nice and it's a must if you go to Singapore.",5
"I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The staff were very accommodating. They let me check in a few hours early and upgraded my room to a sizable room on the 41st floor. I had a great view of the water and could watch the light show every night from the hotel room. The pool had a great view, but it was crowded and I wouldn't call it relaxing. However, I am glad I stayed there once in my life.",5
"Amazing accommodation. We got upgraded to the presidential suite, which was incredible. The buffet downstairs was delicious and worth the 80++ huge variety and everything was delicious. We found alcohol is very expensive here, $20 for a beer. Conected to a great shopping center, very botique shopping center. You'll pay more for everything in this shopping center due to its location inside marina bay sands. We all throughly enjoyed our stay here.",5
"We came all the way only for the pool:) It's very high up, not for the vertigos! :p Singapore is too hot for me. Love the hotel though!  Around here looks like in a Sci-Fi film. I love it! Restaurants are not bad too.  A big giant hotel got everything!",4
"We have been spoilt and have stayed here quite a few times. We have noticed quite a few improvements. It wasn't bad before but it was pleasant to see a number of things made better.  So what has changed: - staff from every area seem more pleasant and with genuine smiles  - room service: I have a habit of ordering Laksa and in the past while the soup was warm, I was glad it was on the hotter side. Also liked the Asian crackers which seem to accompany most Asian dishes like Laksa, Wanton noodles and Nasi Lemak. The Steak was perfectly cooked to our liking and a lovely thick slice compared to thin ones often served in SG restaurants  - Loved Spargo bar/cafe area at the rooftop near the pool. It's a much better use of space and simply warm and inviting with a touch of luxe. Food and…",5
Arrived on the driveway and entered the lobby lost and dazed with staff greeting but not stating the obvious of where reception is to check in.  Some guy is in the line trying to speed up the queues by escorting them to another area. Assume it's for another tower or type of room booked.  Approach the reception desk with rubbish and empty wrappers on the floor and bottle water at the desk. Check in is done assuming a nice high floor as requested and get level 29 when the rooms go up to 50. Kinda disappointing but oh well. Receptionist was nice enough to give a city view instead of garden.   Arrive to the room with finding previous contact lenses on the floor and big long blonde haired on the foot on chair. Great start. Not much storage space for clothes and the technology is…,3
"As one of the highest buildings in Singapore, the 360 degree view is worth at least a One-night stay at this popular Icon of this town. Singapore River/marina bay on one side, the Harbor and Ocean to the other. Just breath taking sunsets, illuminated skyline and a helpful staff and amenities. Glad we made this part of our Christmas Hoilday.",4
"The room is spacious,well equipped, 5 star standard. Bathroom is spacious with a good shower and toiletries. but getting to your room is a challenge, having to weave through lots of people in the lobby  - maybe because of the casino or the fancy popular drinking holes with great view on the top floor. The infinity pool's awesome although it is unsettling to have many of the restaurant guests looking into the pool area!",4
"From the moment we arrived everyone was wonderful.we had The Club room which was huge and luxurious fabulous views perfect .breakfast, afternoon tea and 5pm canapes and drinks on level 55 wonderful ,the infinity pool was amazing children free area great.the staff were absolutely fabulous made us feel special",5
This was the best hotel we have ever been to. The prices are quite high though but it definitely is a once in a lifetime experience to stay there. The rooms were really clean as well and the staff was friendly too. The infinity pool was the best part of course.,5
"Huge place, huge rooms, great view, great location - and an amazing swimming pool at the rooftop (very crowded it was). The elevators were fast, a metro station almost next door and a place to shop. Well, it is a typical huge hotel - if you are looking for a cute, heritage place this is not it. This is all glitz - and if thats what you want, you get it...",4
"We chose Marina Bay Sands mainly because you can't access the pool if you're not a guest and because we wanted some luxury. We arrived in Singapore very early in the morning, but there was no problem getting a room earlier than normal check-in time. The rooms are big and modern. New 42"" flat TV, comfortable beds, free wi-fi. The pool is absolutely magnificent. Lots of chairs available, not crowded, clean, great bar service. The view is breathtaking.  We went to the Fitness center one morning and it was welcoming and clean. And again.... the view! :)  We had breakfast at Sky on 57, which seemed very popular. It was full but not crowded, the food was great.  I had some e-mail correspondence with their customer service both before and after the stay, they replied quickly and…",5
"Marina Bay Sand Hotel is an Iconic Hotel located at the Heart of Singapore. A Stay at Marina Bay Sands will provide you with a great view of Singapore City, including the Merlion Park, Fullerton Hotel(Old Post Office), National Gallery (Old Supreme Court & City Hall), Esplanade, Gardens by the Bay and many more. The view can be seen from either the Hotel Room or the Skypark Infinity Pool.  Marina Bay Sands Hotel services was unexpectedly poor. Requesting for simple Amenities, such as extra towels or change of towels, became a difficult chore. After requesting for a change of Towels and Bath Robes over the Phone, it took them 15 minutes to arrive at my Hotel Room. The staff was either unable to remember or understand my simple request for change of Bath, Hand, Face Towel and Bath…",2
"I stayed here in August for a long weekend. We had a premier room, which was spacious, and had a gorgeous bathroom. Lovely bathtub and the shower was fab. The room itself was quite nice, although for the price, I would have expected a bit more. The mini bar is weighted, so that you can't move anything around without being charged for it. As there is no space provided for your own drinks/food, you can't keep anything in the fridge, and therefore have to purchase from the minibar if you want a cold drink. Not a major issue, but nonetheless, for $500 a pop per night, it would have been nice to have had a small bit of space in the fridge. Apart from that, I can't complain. The hotel has everything you could ever ask for - beautiful restaurants and bars, a casino, a shopping centre…",4
"We booked Marina Bay Sands for our 2015 Countdown.   Initially we booked Grand Club Room but a week before arrival, we were told that the room we booked was not available and we were offered Club Room. Reluctantly we accepted as it was too late to make other arrangements. As compensation, they offered arrival pickup from Airport.   We are glad that we decided to come and stayed in Marina Bay Sands!!  We had one of our best hotel stay.   From Airport pickup to Hotel Checked-In it was perfect. Upon pickup from Airport, we were greeted at the hotel entrance and immediately ushered to our room. The checked in was done in the room. It was excellent service.  The room is spacious and the City View is spectacular. When you insert the Key Card, the curtain immediately open to show you…",5
Stayed for a night but was completely in love with the property. It had everything in itself that you need not to step out.  Rooms were amazing. We stayed at 40th floor having a wonderful views of Singapore city.   Infinity Pool is the best part. Enjoying in the pool was very heavenly. Shopping Arcade at hotel is good and is well connected with MRT. Shopping arcade also had Gandola rides and was mesmerizing. Placed very near to Gardens by the bay and many other tourist attractions. ,5
Excellent hotel  Please ask for garden side room(night view of GARDEN BY BAY ) is amazing  Garden by bay view in night is excellent  Swimming pool is main attraction in hotel..  Swimming is pool just amazing..  Shopping mall is also inside...  ,5
Absolutely loved staying here for our honeymoon. All you have to mention is honeymoon and all the staff always go the extra mile! We came back to our room to find a lovely display of a love heart with rose petals. Considering this was our first time overseas and for our honeymoon the staff at marina bay made it so special for us! They even gave us a free drink just cause we were celebrating our marriage! The in room dining is to die for also they are so lovely when they set up dinner for you! And last but not least our favourite worker there of all time is VERMAR! He is AMAZING! He is so kind and generous he was the one that went the extra mile for us! They should really give him a pay rise! ;) love from the honeymoon couple from room 2719 Mr & Mrs Svensson ,5
"We had wait about 15 minutes while arriving. When arrived at the counter a bit impatient we were promptly given an upgrade to a better view.  The sky park on top of the hotel is ""all that"" and drinks and service is great all way round.  The rooms are of good size, floor to ceiling windows with automatic curtains opening upon entering the room.  Defiantly a hotel to stay in.",5
"Our room overlooked the Gardens By The Bay. it was beautiful. The room is pretty decent sized but the more time you spend at the pool upstairs the better. Like one of the wonders of the world, the view from the pool is worth seeing twice, during the daytime and during the night. Get yourself a couples of drinks and cozy up to your partner in the pool. The skyline of Singapore is absolutely marvellous from here. And from the jacuzzi you'll get to see the port side of Singapore with the ships anchored along the shore. Breathtaking.",5
"Fantastic view and great service. The rooms are spacious and offers also a noise view. The pool can get quite busy,only guest at the hotel can use the pool. The restaurant on the top floor offers good food  but a little expensive but that it expected at a hotel like this. We will stay there again!",4
"The fact that is one of the newest landmarks in Singapore, corroborated with the extraordinary view and the infinity pool are the biggest selling points of this hotel.  But despite being advertised as a 5 stars hotel, it is not quite there yet. The concierge was very fast and helpful considering the crowd but pretty much the excellent service stops at the main floor. We booked for three people and I expected the room to be ready for three people. We had to call twice for additional pair slippers, bedsheets etc.  Nevertheless we got them.   The room was always clean and serviced very well, but we did have some small mishaps mostly because of some language barriers with the staff or maybe because they were overwhelmed.  However we always tipped them and every day we were surprised…",4
"Amazing! it's truly a good vacation hide out.  you won't get tire to keep coming back to this place the view makes you wander.  This is a must see we managed to go different areas in SG, very easy to use the MRT and fare is very affordable.",5
"This bellman named kameezh made my stay so remarkable. I have been to so many hotels yet none of the bellman was like him. So professional, efficient and knowledge. This bellman was so spontaneous, he explained everything about my room to us also gave me advice on which is the best time to take photos at the gardens and also at the pool. I tip him in US dollar cause I did have any singapore dollars plus, He also assist me to pay for my taxi charges because all I had was US dollars which is a shame for me and the moment. What really impressed me was he said that his main concern is not to get tipping from me but to make my stay a very memorable stay. I would recommend every to look for this bellman when you are going to stay at marina bay sands singapore.  Plus the room that I…",5
"We didn`t expect it to be better, the view is amazing, no doubt. The rooms are good aswell. As the hotel is giant and also a bit a touristic sightseeing monument, it is way too busy on the roof top and seems a bit like a public swimming pool. The service is not comparable to the really upperclass hotels, as the hotel is sooo huge.  Other than this: Watching the firework on N.Y.Eve from the flight deck was the best ever!!! And the Staff there was excellent, thank you very much to I think it was Mike the Manager and his team, you made it special.",3
Just to enjoy the pools and view we booked and stayed here. It was really amazing however in my personal opinion it was really over priced for the rooms ! they were dated and nothing really that 5 star. its such a massive hotel it takes forever just to get to your room.  I would never stay again it a place once you tick it off your bucket list thats it !,4
Hotel That you have to one once in your live  Everything excellent No remarks  THE rooms very good but now waauh Service good  IT are standard Nice rooms for That type of hotel Room service super Close or indoor shopping  Splendid view  A most done once hotel with everything on you can wish  ,5
"An amazing hotel with great views but I was really let down by the smell of the hallways and rooms, for the price you pay I felt it would not of been too hard for some air freshener around the place. The room was great very spacious, checking in and out was no drama but would not like to be there with a large crowd as it could get messy.",3
"Stayed here a few years ago with my family - luxurious comfortable rooms, view of course is excellent.  The best part is definitely the access to the skypark and infinity pool.  It gets cold to go swimming at night at that height with the wind blowing in!  You stay in this place for the excellent view of Marina Bay",5
"I've heard and read a lot about this hotel and t's been on our list for a minute. So when we finally got the chance to stay there without hesitation we booked. The room was great. Big, spacious, nothing to complain. Staff is friendly and nice. The location is great and the laser/lighting show across from the hotel is a must see. Main reason for wanting to stay here for me was the pool on the roof. I had to experience it. It was a bit disappointing. Besides the fact that it was extremely busy and crowded, the area around it was under construction. So it was super messy. The adult only area sign is ignored by any and everyone with children which is another point of irritation. Overall I just wasn't impressed. The view is nice but since everyone goes there to take selfies it just…",2
"What to say? It is a great experience to stay at Marina Bay Sands. The view from the swimming pool is breathtaking! The fun of having a drink there, enjoying the view is something that everybody would remember. All hotel's facilities, food, access to other parts of the mall, including casino - well done.",5
"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night during our visit to Singapore for the Grand Prix in September. It was a really nice treat to stay here for 1 night. The room was huge. We also had breakfast included which was very nice and had good choices. The highlight of this hotel is definitely the roof top pool and facilities which were very nice and not crowded. The views are great, the jacuzzi pools were brilliant and there were plenty of seats for everyone. The roof top had a really good holiday atmosphere! I would stay here again.",5
"Not to mistake anyone and to stick to the point: the building is amazing and the view from the 57th floor and the swimming pool is breathtaking. No contest about that.  But fo those who are looking for a palace, the features of a palace, the facilities of a palace and the service of a palace, you have to elect for another hotel. The Marina Bay Sands, at the price of a palace is not a palace and everything is disappointing when it comes to appreciate the minimal and basic services one is in right to expect when one has paid the price for a top notch service, the dearest of all Singapore. Sorry, but the price is not in line with the offered features.   In my experience, I was shocked by the new year eve dinner at the Spago, at a price of 971$, for a table for three, for one hour…",2
"We checked into this hotel right before New Year's with about 300 other people who all seemed to have arrived at the hotel the same time as us.  No worries!  There were people moving queues about and making sure everyone was being serviced in a very efficient fashion.  Although we were to stay in Tower 3, per our reservation and having had to walk about 5 minutes to get to that check-in section, we were given an upgrade from a double twin plus room to a double queen in Tower 1.  No worries, because we were happy to be there and enjoy the experience however it rolled.  Luggage is bar coded and no matter where you are it arrives to you room within minutes of assignment, which was great for us, because we wanted to go immediately to the famous rooftop infinity pool.  Okay, I cannot…",4
"The infinity pool with its fantastic view over Singapore, the Gardens, the rooftop bar and the Shoppers at Marina Bay, all well known places around this fantastic hotel - and they are all worth it to be visited. I really enjoyed my stay at the Marina Bay Sands. My room was on the upper level with view over the Marina Bay. It was very clean, lovely decorated and with all the necessary ammenities. Would visit this hotel again.",5
"We stayed there on the 30th of december and even though it was really crowded, the service was great. Our room was very spacious and well equipped. And the skypool WOOOW!!! It is amazing!! The best view of the marina bay. It was pricey because it is high season but in low season the prices are ok. Cant wait to go back. The only bad thing is that the skypool water is cold, other than that it is my favorite pool in the world.",5
"Checked in on Christmas Eve and was very excited to see what the hype was all about. We booked a deluxe room with 2 twin beds. I didn't see anything spectacular about the room. It had all the basic necessities like towels, robes, slippers, shampoos, soaps (like what all hotels should have). Room size was also normal. What was exceptional was the view from our room. Our room was facing the Gardens By The Bay, and since it was Christmas, there were lots of lights and you can see the influx of people having their picture taken.  Another exceptional thing about this hotel was the view from the infinity pool. You can see the skyline of Singapore and it's a great view for those who love to take pictures.  But the best part of my stay was experiencing the hot bath, sauna, and steam…",4
"On our third visit, a review is inevitable as there were several changes since our last visit in 2013 and it was our first time to stay in a Premier room on Tower 2 (first 2 visits being in a Deluxe room, Tower 3, city and garden view).  We booked a garden view and was hoping to be on a higher floor (30+) like our previous visits, but upon entering the room, the mood changed a lot since the garden view we had at the 19th floor was perfect!  I've seen other videos and photos from people who have stayed in a premier room so I will not post the same.  Rather, what I'll share is a lone photo taken from our balcony.  The room is spacious, separate bath and toilet and the stand-alone bath tub is wonderful!  Having just removed our bath tub at home, being able to use one again was…",5
"I've been in Marina Bay Sands in November, 23rd to 25th and was an amazing experience. I really liked the place and the quality of service. I highly recommend this place for an unique experience. The pool it's the best experience you can live in Marina Bay Sands. If your room is city view I recommend to watch the light show from the room. Really unique place. ",5
"The hotel is clean and perfect for a short gateway. However, there was one disappointment: not enough choices for breakfast at the swimmingpool. There is no food served before 10 am!!!! You can only go to sky 57 for a huge buffet. If you want a light breakfast while enjoying the view, there is nothing for you...",5
The hotel is a bit overrated and overpriced. It's a decent business hotel with great views and great pools. You can surely expect a good night of sleep. The room is spacious but looks quite old fashioned and does not have any sense of design compared to other hotels at the same price range. The lobby is very busy and always packed with people therefore the check in process is not so pleasant.,3
Hotel employees are all friendly and the room is really nice. I was stunned to see the garden from my room. And the famous pool on 57 floor was real nice experience. Especially at night you will feel that your vacation is successful with great night view of Singapore,5
"This hotel is very imposing, awe-inducing architecture and the fac that you have a small garden in your balcony makes it really nice. The view from the pool at the top is really to die for.  It is a bit on the pricey side, at least when we went and the only thing I would reproach is that you feel lost and like an insignificant flea. We had a very different experience downtown where they rushed to get our luggage, asked us how we were and kept talking to us until the check in desk was free.",5
Every thing is amazing about this hotel. Staying here is an experience which one must do once in a life. The infinity pool at the 57th floor gives to a view of Singapore that is unmatched. The staff is friendly the location is amazing the adjacent facilities for shopping and recreation world class. Truly world class hotel.,5
POSITIVE: * has the world's largest rooftop infinity pool * cozy room * fast and reliable wifi * the most friendly staff * amazing views * good location * accessible  NEGATIVE: * long queue at the check-in counter * crowded pool  SUMMARY: MBS offers great accommodations sans the extremely crowded lobby and pool.,5
"Rooms are great with amazing views of Singapore skyline.   But hotel is so large that you feel like you are staying in a shopping mall.  If that appeals to you great but there are other hotels right near by that offer just as spectacular views, room amenities, and luxury with a more intimate feel (e.g. Fairmont).   Also lines to be seated at breakfast were so long that I did not have time to partake of breakfast that was included in my room rate - complete waste of money.   Same thing for check-in and check-out, long lines felt like at a convention site.   Only reason I stayed here was conference event that I was participating in.",4
"Stayed in the hotel for two nights in late November. Great service from desk staff, bell boys, room service etc.  23rd floor room overlooking the bay, great views. Room very good, great shower room and the bed was fab. Infinity pool on 57th floor was awesome with fantastic views of the city.  Good connections by underground train direct to and from the airport. Would recommend the hotel to anyone travelling to Singapore ",5
"if you like huge hotels with touristic restaurant, this is a perfect place to stay. need to go on the roof garden of marina bay hotel!",4
I was here for Business purpose. Stayed here for 3 days. The sky roof top swimming pool was spectacular! The receptionist gave me free upgrade to bigger room with two TVs and a living room :) I will definitely come back to this hotel again with my family later on. Great service!,5
Been there for 3D2N stay and was taken care very well by the hotel staffs! Friendly and the the hospitality was great! The shops was Located very near to the hotel and so many good restaurant around to choose!! It's  a must to stay while in Singapore!!,5
"I have a preference for the historic so Marina Bay is not really my bag but credit where credit is due, the hotel owners have acquired some sensational pieces of memorabilia and, for the enquiring mind, there is a lot more on offer than bricks and mortar.",3
We moved from US to Singapore about 6 months ago and choose MBS as our extended hotel stay (we had also used St. Regis) while we looked for an apartment.  We had a really high floor so the views of the ocean and the singing trees were amazing. The room was nice but the view was stelar.  We used the infinity pool at the very top (even though it got so crowded that it reminded me of a tub) we still enjoyed the beautiful view! ,5
This was the first leg of our honeymoon and we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 4 nights with an overall pleasant experience.   Check In / Out - 3 / 5 - the check in process left a lot to be desired whilst being made to stand in line in amongst the tourists shopping. With such a grand resort it would have been a better touch to have a waiting area on the first floor away from the hustle and bustle of the shopping mall. Minor issue that could probably be improved on quite easily.   Location 4 / 5 - The sheer scale of the hotel means that the place is a must see for most tourists. The underground links directly to the hotel so you can get anywhere you need to be easily enough.  Food 5 / 5 - the hotel has plenty of restaurants. So many that it was hard to choose. We decided on a…,4
Stayed here and happy we did.  Would not do it twice though.  Over the top design with unsurpassed views.  The HUGE negative is way too many people with gates everywhere.  Way too chaotic.  It is a Singapore landmark not to be missed but I bet not many come back.  Sad to give a negative review.,3
"The Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is better suited for the strip on Las Vegas. I was attracted to stay here for the celebrity chef restaurants and the infinity pool.   We choose a club room which gave us access to the club lounge and free food/snacks/booze(only in evening) throughout the day.   The pool was overwhelmingly busy. It was interesting to see and swim in it, but not sure it was worth the stay. The lobby was a madhouse.   You are also across the harbour from the main downtown attractions.  I would recommend staying downtown and if you wanted to visit the restaurants/shops coming over. (Note only guests of hotel can swim in pool). ",3
"The hotel lived up to all of the hype and is grand and elaborate. We arrived early in the morning and the check in line was long but moved quickly. After traveling for 9 hours, I was worried that our room wouldn’t be ready, but Bobby at the front desk was wonderful and got us a room. We stayed in the Premier Garden view room, which was exquisite and spacious. All of the Garden rooms have balconies, which is an added bonus. The Marina Bay Garden has a light show every night, which we watched from our balcony. We wanted to relax on our first day in Singapore so we spent the day at the rooftop pool.  The view from the pool is truly amazing. The pool is not heated but the water still feels good after sitting out in the sun. The poolside menu contains a mix of Western and Asian food.…",5
it just amazing I loved the view which is from the top of the hotel  at mid 7-8 pm  u get to see lazer light show in the ground and its just amazing to view that show  I loved to see the top view and u get a top swimming pool in the top of the floor swimming pool terrace u get food bar swimming pool etc all the best lifestyle up in the terrace there  ' I will 100% recommend the sight to those who are visiting Singapore  u guys will surely enjoy it,5
"  I stayed here for a night in a deluxe room. The room has good seaview. Though there are many guests walking around the hotel and at the famous rooftop pool, the management has good protocols for crowd management. No issues with valet parking, luggage and check-in and check-out. It was a bit pricey though, even for Singapore's standard. Caution: You will be charged once you remove any item from the minibar, whether it is consumed or not. ",4
"Highlights are the pool and the view it's breathtaking and to die for . Lovely cafeteria spread and good food overall. The only thing that irked me was that it does not have any personalised service , all very we'll organised and everything taken care off but because of the hotel being so big with soo many rooms it lacks that personalised attention. But definitely worth a visit for the experience of the swimming pool and the sky lounge bar !!",4
"This hotel has amazing views and the pool is unreal.  We booked a grand club view which included breakfast and canapés at club 55 which were absolutely fantastic!   The chef would make you an omelette which was nice! Make sure you ask for one of these! The service we received by the club staff was second to none, always so polite and respectful.   The only downside to our stay was that we paid the extra money for the grand club room and we were put on level 4 (we thought we would be at least on level 40 or above). We felt unimportant right away :(   This was very disappointing as the noise from the road was so so loud! How ever we called downstairs and let them know we couldn't sleep and they moved us up to level 26 straight away!  Which was great as the rest of our stay was…",4
Of course this hotel is amazing. everything you want is here and is great. spend two nights here with my girlfriend after i had been away with work for 4 months. paid $2500 for two nights in a nice big room known as there honey moon suit. The deal come with roses chocolate and wine. On arrival i asked if it would be all set up in the room cause this was my big surprise and they said yes sir its all done. I made it out to be a big deal to my girlfriend that there was a surprise waiting for her in the room and when we got there is made me look like a complete fool. there was nothing no surprise no wine no chocolate no flowers. call them up and they said to me i should have asked them first and made sure and i said i did and they could not have cared any less. Thanks for the let…,3
"As a local Singaporean I try to spend my money wisely but I recently attended a business function here and I am happy the company picked up the bill as it was a pretty penny. Still the iconic sky pool is truly amazing and service is very good although check in and check out was a bit on the slide side. Room was large but nothing spectacular except the view. Food was very good already, with plenty of choice.",4
"Room: The rooms is large, clean and nice. However, the TV is a little small and old for the price tag.  Infinity Pool: The pool has a spectacular view but it's overcrowded.   Food: The drinks and food are all over priced. The breakfast was crowded.   Location: It's located in a convenient place. In saying that, most places in Singapore is convenient.",3
"The Pool was over crowded, the checkin staff were not that welcoming, the luggage took ages to be delivered to my room. On checking out no one came to get my luggage so had to lug several pieces of luggage to the front desk. I was asked to pay for drinking water in room even though Singapore is a hot and humid country. Overall could have stayed at a better hotel and got separate sky park tickets.",3
"We arrived around noon and our room wasn't ready, but we could leave our bags at the reception desk and get to the pool. The attraction everybody is here for, of course. The pool was crowded (with most people taking selfies) but what's to expect? It's just stunning to swim in.  After waiting for a few hours and checking for a second time if our room was ready (which it wasn't) the staff apologized that we had to wait that long. As a compensation we got a room upgrade. The place was huge, with great views of the marina bay, a luxurious bathroom and long balcony. Expensive hotel, but worth it for one night. More if you can afford it. :)",5
It is a beautiful hotel and it has infinity pool top of the hotel.it is very romantic hotel and their is place which we can get the experience driving Ferrari and Lamborghini.in Sri Lanka we cannot get that experience it is a unbelievable moment for me.i like to stay that hotel again and again,5
"This place is something to experience. The sheer scale of everything is incredible. The architecture and art will leave you in awe.   Once you get past this, the hotel is really nice but not the best. We stayed in a suite with a huge bathroom; however, the King bed was tiny (almost laughable given the size of the room) and the sound from the highway was annoying (4th floor).  Definitely recommend getting breakfast room service and eating it in your robe! :) A tip - if you're checking out too early to eat breakfast at the restaurant, ask for a room service credit (~96 SGD) to use on brekkie.   Close to upscale shopping, but definitely not ""the meat"" of Singapore. Venture inland, beyond the hotel and waterfront. ",4
"MBS is an iconic Singapore hotel for good reason; the views are stunning, the location is massive, and its a giant complex with everything you would need.   Although the hotel itself is nice, it's overcrowding situation makes the hotel feel like a metro station during rush hour. The lobby is constantly flooded with crowds of tourists and their selfie sticks... the same situation exists on the rooftop infinity pool area as well. The number of children screaming and splashing other guests make you feel like you're aboard a Carnival cruise. Visit the pool area right when it opens to watch the sunrise and avoid the crowds!  If you're thinking about joining the rooftop sunrise yoga class... please avoid! At around 30 dollars, it's a total ripoff. The provided mats are old and smelly…",3
"I stayed here for one night during my recent trip to Singapore. It will take you around 20 to 30 minutes from Airport to MBS (Bayfront Station) via SMRT. I arrived around 1pm, check in was smooth, very courteous front desk staff and they gave me a room at the 20th floor facing the Garden by The Bay. Room was big, warm and cozy, comfy bed, big LED TV, huge bathroom. Dont forget to visit the Sands Skypark and Infinity pool at the 57th floor where you can see the best view of Singapore. If your up for shopping, the marina bay shoppes is just a walking distance, connected to the hotel, expo and convention center. Most of singapore city attraction were a short walk from teh hotel stay. Great place to stay, will be back soon. Check out was very fast too. Thank You",5
"Its just a cash collecting machine.  Check in registration shows big signs of check out only!   It's so over crowded, as if you are in a metro station.   I was told by the hotel staff that you cannot see the lights show from the pool deck, and that we would have to see the show from the bay area, I read some reviews now saying you can see it from the promenade.   It's not a 'hotel', very commercial. Room feels like you are in an airport hotel.   TV was not working, bathroom floor is scary slippery, no proper signage to lead from 22nd floor lifts that take you up to the deck. By the way when you get to the deck, it's so busy, you don't want to be in the pool with a 1000 people.   The gym attendant was sleeping, machines are not cleaned properly. Room is not cleaned until 4pm…",1
"I love Marina Bay Sands, merlion, esplanada i would definitely go back to this place! The people are very disciplined and the place, sidewalks are very clean. The next time we will visit SG again i will make sure that i have a good camera to capture special moment and nice sightseeing",5
"perfect place to stay in Singapore, fascinating architecture and great location most of Singapore attractions are within a walking distance, the lunch at RISE was good with unlimited options, the pool was magnificent with amazing view the only downside was the crowds.",4
... then just settle down by the huge window and enjoy the prime view of Singapore city. Rooms are large and nicely appointed. Staff are friendly which is amazing given the huge number of guests. Pool is a novelty. Club facilities are fine.,4
"When choosing this hotel one should consider how popular it is with tourists and it is always busy in the lobby and on top floor. Ok to stay for 1-2 nights, but more would be to much. The standard greeting when you call any service is ""we are sorry to keep you waiting"" so be prepared to wait for bellman, laundry, room service... ",4
"We stayed one night to try out the infinity pool but we were amazed at everything that involved this hotel! The staff was so attentive and the restaurants within the hotel are SO good! I recommend to take the breakfast package and go to the restaurant in the main floor, there are infinite amount of options! Absolutely stunning views of the city from the skydeck! ",5
"One of the best hotel I have seen.. Huge , magnificent and exotic place.. Needless to say about the wonderful hospitality of the staff...  Pool is simply put of the world.. Perfect place for the couples to stay and experience the luxury and class!!!",5
swimpool is really great with amazing view. the room ok with garden by the bay view. I really like the scent of toiletries of mbs. the skypark is really full. my son have a birthday cake from mbs as compliment and he like it.,5
"I offer a night in MBS for my sister and boyfriend anniversary. They had an amazing time and been upgraded to a suite which is great and highly appreciated.  However, I am very disappointed with MBS booking service and management. I tried to book online and asked for pre payment. It was really difficult and had to fill a form which I was unable to do at this time. They then offer me to check in with my sister in order to pay upfront.  I did the check in and advice at the reception that it is a gift and I don't want my sister to know about the amount I paid and that I need to be charged now. I gave my credit card and was obviously expected to be charged.  During check out, reception asked my sister my credit card to charge me. I didn't give them as I was sure it was charged…",4
"One of the most beautiful place that I have visited. Great hospitality, service and VIEW. Yes, view from their infinity pool is to die for. Feels like you are on top of the world. Overall it’s a very good place. I can t find a reason to underrate it.",5
"Nice hotel, nice view, good location for those who want to watch a show at marina bay sand theatre or goong to garden by the bay. MRT station at walking distance. The famous infinity pool is on the top floor looking over the merlion statue and have a separate pool for adult and for kids. It was haze (quite bad) so city view from pool/room area not that clear and we prefer stay indoor. We're staying at Club room so we got a free access to the pool and gym. Each person need a card to access the pool/gym area even for kids (they provide a kids card too). Club lounge very crowded during our visit even for the cocktail time there was a long queue. Adrift restaurant have a good food and recommended.",4
"Staying at Sands right now. I thought Singapore is supposed to be a 'connected' city. But then I encounter this hotel with the worst wifi experience ever (except for an island resort in sabah, but that's actually a lot more forgivable.  Their ""free"" 'Plan A"" is simply unusably slow -  modem 14.4k experience. And then I wanted to change to the SGD20 plan B, it'd take the IT support 15 mins! to reset this one single value, manually. I remember my XT didn't even need 15 mins to reboot.",1
I stayed at this hotel on 5 Dec 2015 . Amazing amazing hotel . We got upgraded to 31st floor at city view which was superb . The infinity pool is a must visit . Overall a tremendous experience  The service is 5 star . One thing disappointing is that there are no fast food chains inside the shopping mall which was a set back  ,5
"There is no doubt that MBS is renowned for her architectural design, infinity pool, sky garden and casino. Great hotel that makes every Singaporean proud. However, my recent stay-cation change my impression on MBS.  Booked a Family Room recently with MBS. Due to ankle injury, I requested for a wheelchair. They can't guarantee me the availability unlike another nearby 5 star hotel which I stayed the day before. The personal touch was not there. Upon arriving, there were many guests and we need to queue for almost 15 minutes before getting the room. I must thank the concierge staff for the trouble of getting the wheelchair from the Shoppers.   The Family room is big and comfy. But we found the room dusty and we took sometime wiping the coffee table and chairs. I was horrified to…",3
Stayed one night just to try and did not regret it. The room was spacious and could accommodate the four of us (2 adults and 2 children) sufficiently. There were 2 TVs so the adults can watch one TV and the kids the other. Plenty of channels to choose from. The pool was excellent. The kids loved it. Location is great as well. Plenty of eateries around although they can be quite expensive. Service was immaculate. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5
nice place to visit as specially if your are in Singapore. There are so many other thinks near by. There Sands SkyPark Observation Deck Take in the stunning views from the public observation deck at Marina Bay Sands. every day there are approximately 15 min  laser show in the evening.,5
"This place is quite simply an architectural marvel and a sight to behold. We stayed on the 47th floor, the room we got was big, the bed super comfortable and the view, oh my! Breathtaking - especially at night where we could see the Singapore's skyline transformed into this magical sight.  The infinity pool is another gorgeous spectacle - didn't use it as it had far too many posers than swimmers when we were there. We just took pictures and left - far too many people for our own good.  This place is huge - too huge that we found ourselves literally playing a waiting game. From checking in/out to waiting to be seated in their restaurant to waiting for the housekeeping to deliver extra set of towels.  And yes, even though all the staff we encountered were great and efficient, they…",4
"Wonderful experience, fabulous service, the pool overlooking the entire Singapore is the most wonderful experiences of all... The structure and the architecture of the hotel is commendable.. This is a spot to visit in it own. Had a wonderful time....",5
"It has a cozy, luxurious overall appeal with regards to the exterior or the rooms itself. The feeling of getting pampered by the staff were unbelievable for me and my wife as well. So much so that we held our wedding there and never regret our decision. Besides having helpful staff such as Jeraldine Ang and Vance on the front desk, their bellboy and restaurant affiliated staff were all pleasant and helpful. For those intending to hold a wedding/events, you will have competent and experienced staff to guide you through like how they did. Knowing we are on a bridal suite, there were rose petals scattered all around decorating the room and it was really the personal touch that touches our heart. There was many gesture of goodwill from the hotel as well making us feel like we were…",5
