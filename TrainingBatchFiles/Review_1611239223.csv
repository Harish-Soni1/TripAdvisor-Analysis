"On a recent family visit to Singapore this was definitely on our list of places to visit. The structure is massive and so iconic for Singapore it is hard to miss, dominating the city. It is worth visiting just to see the unreal architecture and the amazing views from the viewing deck.A unusual experience going in a lift with no windows and only buttons fro floor 1 and then 56..but the views justify it.  Equally it plays a key in the Light show in the Bay so it is amazing to see at night as well. A must visit in Singapore to sample the atmosphere and architecture",5,
This hotel is a must when visiting Singapore! The highest in Singapore with use of inifinity pool when you stay! When you go to Singapore it was definitely one of the highlights of our stay! Service is brillant always checking if you want drinks by the pool or if you need anything for the room. Heard the minibar can be expensive but we ordered a private fridge to the room and used that. ,5,
"So this is a very large, very busy and very impressive hotel. However, if you are looking for the personal touch, this is not the hotel for you.  The pool is the undoubted highlight, and wasn't too busy which was surprising. Service was good overall as were the restaurants we tried.   The room was surprisingly basic given the rest of the hotel, it was fine don't get me wrong, but a bit sparse and decoration was not what you would expect.   Not the sort of place I would stay for a long period, but for a couple of nights, it offers something quote different.",4,
"Stayed here last year.  As a spectacle it's unbeatable...  The only gripe, the room itself didn't really scream luxury. It was a little standard. At a hotel like this you'd expect a certain style type and quirks. It seems they put everything into the architecture instead.  I will be back to try the pool.  PS - I didn't fair well at all at the casino... ",4,
"This hotel and the surrounding shops and attractions could keep you busy for days.  The hotel itself is a marvel of architecture.  It is pricey for what you get, BUT, we only stayed there to be able to get up to the infinity pool and the MBS skywalk is included in the room price.  It was worth it just to be able to swim and take pics from the infinity pool.  A great view of the Gardens By the Bay just next door.  The connecting shops are huge and very upscale and trendy.  Many good restaurants in the complex.  If you want to eat on the cheap - there is a very good food court downstairs in the shops.  Of course the casino will be an attraction to a lot of folks.  Although I didn't gamble, I walked around the casino and it was laid out very nice.  The highlights of this stay for…",4,
"Service is NON existence in this hotel.. Where to start?  I am in the HOTEL at the time writing this review (11/18. 10.39am Room 4225 check it out)  The so call executive club is a joke, they are nothing more than a cafe in the 55 floor.  Beside serving you food, there practically can do nothing for you.  I forget my card, and they cannot even let you go back to the floor of your room, so you have to walk from Tower 2, all the way to the front lobby just to have your them issue you a card.  Unlike Ritz Carlton or Mandarin their executive club is able to provide you with a full range of services.  Next my baby girl spilled milk over HERSELF and the high chair.  So I thought the waitress (Mina) would go and get some napkin for me to clean up the baby.  Instead the first thing she…",1,
"This hotel is among the best I have visited. This is the type of hotel where someone literally do not need to leave because it has it all. They are built adjacent to a casino and high end shopping mall with numerous restaurants with all cuisines. They also have that beautiful infinity pool which everyone already know.  Our room type is premier room with harbor view. It is wonderful, spacious, with comfortable bed and pillow.   There are multiple breakfast option available. Meaning you can choose from 3 restaurants as you like. The options are Rise (ground floor), Spago (57th floor), and Adrift (ground floor). During our 4 days stay, we had the first day breakfast at Spago and the following days always at Rise. Spago is very popular. The breakfast at Spago started at 7am. By 7:30…",4,
The building has to be one of the worlds most iconic and the room and top floor infinity pool were equal to expectations....brilliant! The room was huge and fully specked out with all you could ask including multiple USB charging points. Our room was on the 46th floor and had a spectacular view as building curved and undercut beneath us. The pool deck is second to none and is a MUST DO. the view from the 150m infinity pool edge was mesmerizing. We were reluctant to return to Singapore as it is just tooooo capatalistic but as we had a conference here we had to come and staying at the Marina Sands made it a special trip indeed.,5,
"This hotel is a must see and stay when you visit Singapore. The awe of this hotel and shopping complex as it towers over the marina is simply stunning.  The lobby is stunning and ensure you check which desk you will be checking into before arriving as each tower has its own check in counter. Each room is set out perfectly and the lead in room (which is the most basic that the hotel has to offer) is amazing. Very spacious with great views and all including a bath. The garden view rooms are not to be overlooked as the night show of the gardens of the bay is beautiful to watch from your balcony.  There is plenty to do at this hotel with the skypark having the beautiful and extremely large pool on the roof, which has plenty of space for guests, the casino, plenty of shopping and…",5,
"This hotel is a gem, but beside it architecture is the service that reach a very high standard in excellence. Treat yourself with a package that include the club 55 access you wouldn’t regret it : no queue for breakfast or dinner and enjoy the unique view of this private club. Millions of comments have already made about the infinity pool and of course it is breathtaking! As every success it has a bad side : it is crowded all the time. But Singapore has so much to offer so once you made that famous picture, no need to come back and fight to get a place in the pool.   We had a specially smooth and great premium experience by getting picked up at the airport, checking made directly in the room. Thank you very much to all the staff which is one of the best I ever see. ",5,
"A great place to walk out and get some sunshine on a flying visit to Singapore. Beautiful views, lovely choice of food & drink and shops as museums pretty much.   Top tip do the bar option for $20 for the views at the top, all redeemable against the menu, good service, great choices and all the views anyway! ",5,
"I have had the pleasure of staying at many different hotels, but my goodness, this hotel tops all of them as the most amazing hotel ever. The staff here really knows what they are doing to help their guests feel welcome. I am not sure where to even begin.   When my room was cleaned a small bag with a few valuables was accidentally thrown in the trash, when I expressed my concern the staff went to the trash and found the bag and brought it back!!!!! IT was amazing !   When two kids who were unattended throughout the elevators and the pool area made me get hurt by the elevator, the hotel offered free breakfast and free VIP private luxury car to take my mother and I to the airport for our departure.   This is the type of hotel that Marina Bay Sands is. I live in Los Angeles and I…",5,
"I have been with my family to this hotel in Singapore and the service was impeccable, since we arrived at the airport. We did the transfer directly with the hotel, so there was a lady waiting literarily outside on the plane, and helped us until the security to show passports. Then the car was so luxurious, the check in was smoothly, we entered on the garage so did not do the check in at the main reception/ The room was huge, my both children were sleeping on the sofa bed, and the toilet was so big, that we could have shower all at same time, so we can imagine how bit. Infinity poor was overcrowded some days but a must. You need to take your room key so you can go inside, you have robes in the room, and towels upstairs on the 57th floor where infinity pool was. Lifts you need to…",5,
"Stayed in this hotel with my wife and two kids in the second half of October 2018 for two nights.  We stayed in a family suite.  Although family suites are located on lower floors, they offer a great value. Rooms are huge, bathrooms are very nice, and terrace is absolutely wonderful.  We had an issue with outside noise during our first night as terrace doors did not work properly.  Despite being full on the weekend the hotel found us another room, which was great. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and stay there again.",5,
"Stayed for 4 nights at a one bedroom Suite, 30 Oct to 03 Nov. The room cleaner always made sure our room was very comfortable to stay in. She always leaves different animal towels for our kids and they loved it. She cleans very well but does not understand english, her name is Ms. Yu Lan Qi. Everything was perfect and we really enjoyed our stay. Will be back again.",5,
"I stayed here for staycation with my friend. This beautiful & unique hotel is ideally located. Great atmosphere, great service! Check-in was smooth as silk. From the moment we checked in, we were treated like a valued guest even though we hadn’t stayed there before. We were warmly greeted by Ms Jessica from the Reception who is charismatic & friendly. We were assigned room on Tower 3 overlooking the beautiful Gardens by The Bay. Nice room, very spacious & was kept spotless by the housekeeper. The infinity pool is the main highlight. Don’t forget to bring your key card. No card no entry. We really had a great time. Thank you everyone from MBS for making this stay a memorable one! ",5,
Just checked in at the marina bay sands. Not impressed!! The room has a very bad smell & is basic room for the price you pay. I’ve had a better rooms on the beach of Thailand. I asked for a harbour view room which you have to pay extra for instead of the garden view & once I arrived both rooms actually mean the same!!!  Very confusing wording on the room view options. When I rang the reception to complain about the terrible smell & view they didn’t offer to change my view only my room due to the smell. No offer of a complimentary. For a room that you pay over £500 a night for I really wouldn’t bother staying here,1,
"We stayed for just a night as we wanted to experience the infinity pool, but with the awesome room we had, we found ourselves enthralled by the amazing views of both the city from the main room and the gardens from the bathroom.  We made it up to the pool at sunset and it was everything we had hoped.  Not sure I would stay here regularly with the cost, but as an occasional treat it is well worth it!",5,
"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of our stop over through Singapore just to say we’ve “stayed there” - so glad we did!! Every little part of MBS was pure luxury, caring about all the details.  Check in was great - got a room upgrade to one of the club rooms on the 49th floor! Amazing bath, two sinks, beautiful view of marina bay. We were greeted by cute towel animal art too!  Floors were immaculately clean for carpet.  Go to the infinity pool before 8am - especially if you want to properly swim. They take out the lap lane by about 9am. Sun loungers IN the pool and poolside service - all with a beautiful view.  MRT is underneath so if you want to save on dining - just a short 5min trip will bring you to food and shopping more than half the price.   Gym - got protein shakes at…",5,
"Stayed at MBS Hotel Tower 2- premier city view room 3250 from 14-16Nov. Had an extremely pleasant stay at this hotel, everything was up to and even exceeded expectations. Staff are hospitable and friendly, and service feels warm, personal and genuine. Bathroom is very big and makes me feel like a palace whenever I step inside. Infinity pool @ 57th floor has more than enough space for everyone and it is an enjoyable experience to look out at the city, especially at night. Fitness centre @ 55th floor has a full range of state-of-the-art gym equipment with city views and is the best gym I can ever ask for, the sauna and hot pool is simply relaxing and allows me to meditate peacefully as I throw my troubles out of this world. Room is extremely spacious and is able to accommodate up…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a modern icon of Singapore and is one of the most spectacular hotels, especially from the rooftop infinity pool and garden, that you could find.  It is packed with restaurants, a casino, shopping centre, conference facilities and adjacent to the gardens and bayfront area. Rooms have spectacular views too but are on the basic side for a luxury hotel.  Service was also a bit below top 5 star levels found elsewhere in Singapore - aka the superb Raffles, e.g. No turn down service, no minibar, poor WiFi and waiting on hold for in room dining to answer - but the quality of food was very good when it arrived!",4,
"The hotel is in a perfect location, you have access to the shops and the restaurants which is amazing, you also can walk right over to the gardens by the bay which is such a sight to see.   But the hotel lacks hospitality, and service. The rooms are kinda small, compared to a New York or a Paris size room, and I guess my disappointments are really in the hospitality with the staff.   We stayed here to check out the pool, we had 2 nights in Singapore and you cannot visit the pool unless you’re a guest or the hotel, which is rightfully so. The views on the rooftop were amazing. We e joyed our time in Singapore but was disappointed with this resort. I really thought they could have been better.",3,
"The hotel is an icon and a stay here is unforgettable as it is such an unusual experience. We stayed here for 8 nights in April and enjoyed a room towards the city skyline with a great view. The pool area is a crazy scene with people posing to their mobile phone all the time and the lounge music filling the air in 190 meters height. The breakfast is equally an unusual experience as you have to get up early when the breakfast restaurants (the one on the pool floor is the best!) opens to avoid waiting too long in a line. Waiting in line soon becomes part of the experience at Marina Bay Sands, which makes it a bit tivoli like. The breakfast was good though. We had dinner 4 times at Lavo, the restaurant situated on the pool level, and it was a great experience (and magnificent…",4,
"Check in was a bit slow and i understand due to number of guest.Hotel was impressive inside.Very accomodating staff upon entry.Manage to get a high floor with a nice garden view.The exciting part was the pool,but the downside was you need to bring your hotel card each person.We only bring one card just to see the pool at around 530pm,but the staff was very accomodating to let us in just asking our room number and are we a valid guest.They are very polite and with a smile to us...Pool was great and we manage to find a place near to the pool.When we exit we must tap in the card again just like in a subway..Special mention to the staff at the gate rachel and dennis who was very friendly and  remembering us upon exit,as i joke with them that im James Bond.:)very impressive…",5,
gorgeous hotel and the staff couldn't do enough to help. I recommend cocktails in Ce la Vie the views are beyond belief.... pricey but worth it! and the light show at 8pm is not to be missed. great thing to do if you are not resident in the hotel is buy a visitor pass and it's redeemable on drinks ,5,
"Fastest check-out experience ever. Just drop your keys and form at the designated boxes and you're done! Ours was a high floor corner room in Tower 3 and it offered the best view of the sea, the city, Marina Barrage, and the Gardens by the Bay. It's the best location to just relax and lounge and marvel at the beautiful landscape before you. You get a free access to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark when you book a room--just tap your room keycard upon entering. The best part for us was swimming in the infinity pool and getting the best seat in the house for the light show! You'll never get tired looking at the jaw dropping view of the Singapore skyline. It's really romantic!",5,
"Right now I am lounging at the infinity pool and this is truly spectacular. It is definitely worth to pay up to enjoy staying at this iconic hotel. Even better, by signing up for the Sands membership before you book the hotel, you can enjoy the members rate for as low as S$299, which, is about 50% of the rate I found anywhere else. There are no bad rooms. The garden view is really the garden/ocean view, while the city view allows you a view of the city and at nights a great view of the water and light show.   You are here to enjoy the infinity pool, breakfast on the 57th floor, open air at Spago, where you can see the sunrise in a a chic outdoor setting while eating great food.  Also, the hotel is a few steps from the Gardens by the Bay, another must see visit while here in…",5,
"Oh my.. picture looks so perfect but when you start to queue in for your check in - you will lose patience but at least there is a hotel staff who offers water and juices while you wait which means to say that it will be a forever/long time in the queue . When you pay 700$ Singaporean dollar per night- I was expecting more for the service.   Hotel lobby - I kid you not- the worse look/design I’ve ever seen for a 5 star hotel- I’ll grade it as a 1 star out of 5. It is just like walking in to a tacky restaurant where there is no wow factor.  After checking in-  the elevator service was another wait. I guest with the amount of tourist that they have- our wait time to get in the elevator was close to 5 minutes.  Room was a good size/decent size - air conditioning could be better, we…",2,
"An amazing hotel, in a great location. Very spacious rooms (we had one facing the city, and the other one facing the harbour). Clean, very quiet, and very large bath room.   The great rooftop pool is something hard to describe. Although this hotel runs more like a large plant, it still is a very high ranked hotel.",5,
"If you ever plan to travel to Singapore, partly business, partly pleasure, pick Marina Bay Sands! Firstly: what a gorgeous architecture! Secondly: if you didn’t live here, you would come here after all! Because it all happens here: the wonderful infinity pool, the 2 o’clock tea, the 5 o’clock champagne and gardens by the bay and all the fantastic light and music shows! So friendly, so clean, so beautiful! ",5,
"beautiful experience, wonderful suite with double view. Excellent service and excellent customer care. Wonderful bed with city view, fantastic bathroom with shower and tub facing the sea view. The night is a wonderful show. Cavalli's personal care products. Espresso machine in the living room with a wide selection of blends.  Absolutely to try at least once in life.",5,
I wish I could have stayed or I can stay in the future at the hotel :) Beautiful background. Beautiful lights,5,
"They say that “as long as your hotel room is clean and tidy that’s all you need when your on holidays, save your money for spending” !!! .. NO WAY !, in my view you get what you pay for and staying in the right hotel can either make or break your holiday. I have stayed in some amazing, luxurious hotels all around the world but the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a cut above all the rest. You really don’t need to leave the resort if you don’t want to, everything is under 1 roof. A huge variety of restaurants and bars, shops, coffee houses, casino, and many services not to mention the Gardens by the bay and the laser light show. From the moment you step inside the doors you start to soak up the luxury of it all, not cheap by any means ( approx. price per night can vary from…",5,
The structure is beautiful large and well worth a visit. Casino is disgusting they check your passport in and out and cigarette smoke fills the air and your clothes only stayed 5 mins. View from the top is amazing. ,5,
"I was lucky enough to reside for 3 nights four days at this amazing hotel due to a business event in September!  The infinity pool is a once in a lifetime experience, albeit my family were so envious I am planning on returning in teo years time for a special birthday celebration with them !  Great customer service from all staff I met with and five star facilities that i witnessed ( gym spa and restaurants etc )  If you get the opportunity do not miss !!",5,
"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands recently and thoroughly enjoyed the experience! Yes, this is a big hotel and heaps of people and places to see and do, but the service still remains very good!  wait times at check in were minimal and even though we arrived well before check in time, the team did everything  they could to find a room for us.  We got an upgrade to a deluxe family room which was huge and provided a great view of Gardens by the Bay.  The hotel facilities are first class with a great fitness centre, heaps of restaurant choices, friendly efficient service and then of course there's the world famous infinity pool! Definitely worth a visit in itself just to soak in the views and atmosphere, a truly memorable experience. The added benefit of staying at the…",5,
"By far, the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Service was fantastic, as were the room. Absolutely spectacular city view from the room. A fantastic infinity pool. The property is full of high-end shops and many restaurants. I would not hesitate to return and to recommend it.",5,
"Great hotel with nice staff.  However, it was flawed by the breakfast experience.  Total mis-management!  Queuing when tables were empty and when you do go in, you are asked to share your table with strangers.",4,
"I was celebrating a very special occasion with my wife and daughter and I really wanted to make it exciting for my young daughter who was super thrilled when she got to know that we were doing a staycation at MBS . The lady who was  checking us  in   was very polite and despite her best intentions ended up committing an error and I was really touched how they tried to make it good  . Unheard of in the Industry . This shows what makes a property great. During my brief stay I tried to make use of the Coffee House RENKO , LOVO the italian restaurant and the fine dining wing of SPAGO and I must say I was happy with all 3 . The premier room that I had booked was made special when they gave me an upgrade. The staff delivered special cake for this special occasion and we left with…",5,
"This is hands down the best hotel I've stayed in to date. The attention to detail is evident throughout the entire stay. I've never come across a more friendly staff, all of whom genuinely care about you enjoying your time with them. I ordered room service several times and the food was great. I didn't dine at the restaurants directly inside the hotel, as I did find them extremely pricey, however there are plenty of options for dining in the adjoining shopping mall. My room had views of the gardens which was beautiful day and night. For being a large property, it doesn't take long to walk to different attractions like it does one some Vegas properties. Really enjoyed the bridge you can take directly to the Gardens by the Bay. The pool view and service at the lounge chairs is to…",5,
"The receptionist did very well and polite , nice atmosphere , nice view from the top  i will stay here again when i come back to singapore . In the morning , you should go to the swimming pool to relax , it was really awesome.",5,
"This place is great if you love huge (and I mean huge) modern hotels. We arrived straight from a cruise and were able to check in to the club room that we had reserved which was nice - not having to wait. The room was huge, great views of the inner bay and on the other side the amazing gardens (do visit these if you go). We loved level 55 for breakfast and pre dinner drinks both included in our package, also of course we swam in the iconic pool, but beware it’s not a restful experience, as no matter what time of day you go there it’s always packed. We ate in some of the restaurants there, the best being Spago, but very expensive. The casino was huge and mainly aimed at the Chinese market, we found it odd that everyone is still allowed to smoke in there, so we didn’t stay long.…",4,
We stayed here for 1 night on our first night in Singapore. We were tested to a room upgrade to the Orchid Suite and they accommodated our request to be in the same block as friends who were staying as well. Great service from the get go!  The suite was enormous and the views of the city were breathtaking from the 54th floor! The freestanding bath was also an added perk.  We shot up to the 57th to try out the infinity pool and that also lived up the hype. We caught a glorious sunset and it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be. One other tip is to head to the hot tubs on the garden side to see the gardens by the bay light show at 7.45pm from above. Another tip is to wake up early and get to the pool for opening time to enjoy it all to yourselves. We got there at 6.30 and…,5,
"I have to say I’ve been to Singapore before and was in awe of this hotel the minute I saw it. So promised next time we went we would stay there. So we did and got the most amazing upgrade free of charge into a suite. It had a grand piano karaoke room gym hair salon , 5 toilets !!! It was amazing. The staff where all friendly and couldn’t have done more for us and even without the upgrade the hotel is magical and worth every penny. The food was great at the top in Wolfgang restaurant. Enjoyed every minute",5,
"We stayed here for our last night of our holiday traveling in Singapore as a treat after visiting the bar on our last trip. We stayed on the 30th floor with views across the Gardens by the Bay, room lovely and big and th balcony with view gave it a feel above the average. The infinity pool on the roof is amazing, particularly at night with Singapore lit up before it. Plenty of loungers and staff on hand to assist, some great photo opportunities. We viewed the stay as an event in itself and it really excelled itself.",5,
"Don’t get me wrong, the building is interesting and full of proposals, including the well known swimming pool on the roof and on the city or the close by garden with built trees. The location is for sure interesting. And so the view.   But no real charm, long time to get a breakfast, the intimacy of a station, the impression to be in a commercial centre, more than in the hall of an Hôtel.   Maybe better to visit than to stay in ",3,
"I have high expectations so when staying here in one of the sands suites I wondered if it would match up. From being collected at changi airport in a blacked out suv to private check in and your own butler marina bay sands exceeded my expectations. A very generous sized suite with pool table,large dining table and even larger lounge area, a very generous sized bedroom and a bathroom bigger than some hotel rooms. The butler service was exceptional, it was our anniversary while we stayed there and our butler came to turn down the room and Offered to run my wife a bath she then spent 15 minutes placing individual rose petals on top of the bubbles. Room service was also very attentive. The rooftop infinity pool is a sight to behold at night overlooking the sprawling Singapore…",5,
We stayed here for our last night of our holiday traveling round South East Asia and what a treat that was. Check in was quick and we were upgraded to a room on the 47th floor the room was spacious and very clean we had a small balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay. All the staff are friendly and the breakfast had lots of choices there are 3 restaurants to chose from for breakfast we had ours at Rise. The infinity pool on the roof was amazing plenty of sun loungers and lots of staff taking food and drinks orders there are 3 jacuzzis on the rooftop aswell. There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel with plenty of places to eat. I would definitely recommend staying here,5,
Really a great hotel and a great experience. Although the number of guest is huge you get individual treatment and perfect service. Location is perfect to discover Singapore. Take the view from the pool and decide where to go o4 stay there and enjoy.,5,
This was a experience of a lifetime.  You will find more luxurious hotels but not an experience like this. The scale was incredible and the room was very pleasant.  The highlight was the rooftop swimming pool.  The changing facilities were not great but the overall experience was phenomenal - great views and a novel place to swim. The shopping center on site was amazing.,5,
"I've been to singapore this summer with my mom. I reserved this hotel becasue it's serving as a not only hotel, but landmark of singapore. This hotel is easy to approach because it's connected with subway station, but the whole building is huge that you might lose your way. Once you check in the hotel you will surprise because the sight of the hotel room is so good (you can see Botanic garen, but it depends on what room you get). Also, Infinity Pool on the top of the building is very good. During the night you can see the fantastic night view of Singapore, also food on the loof top is not bad. I know the fee is very expensive, but it's worth it.",5,
"Last night I was fortunate to dine at ‘Spago’ which ultimately became an enjoyable experience. Despite my regular appearances in this part of the world, somewhat naively, I requested an outside table with the idea that the view from the 57th Floor would be amazing and it is! However, the heat & humidity is not geared to eating outside even here and even more annoyingly, all the men, women & children swimming and making lots of noise in the adjacent infinity pool also think it’s good to look at you, your table and food. The Restaurant team (Mike The Maitre’D or one of and the fabulous Anqur came to my rescue and as quickly as possible found me a table inside this very classy restaurant with first class food & service. So, please visit but ask for an inside table if you are to…",5,
"This hotel was a true experience... I fulfilled my screen saver goal staying here!! The location was the best.. walking distance to the train and is attached to Gardens by the Bay. My room has an amazing view of the River and of the light show. Remote control blackout curtains was my favorite part. Hotel staff was also amazing, food was on point!!! I will stay here again.. Highly recommended",5,
Great area and one of Singapore iconic building! Lots of shops and restaurants. Lots of thing to do in Marina Bay! You will never get bored and highly recommended !,5,
"The Marina Bay Sands building is iconic, beautiful and it dominates the Singapore skyline. Expectations are high, but they are met by attentive staff who are there to ensure that every request is met to ensure that guests feel spoiled and completely indulged.  The hotel is clean and every expectation was met. No complaints here of missing amenities or dirty rooms. This was a fabulous experience.",5,
"I spent one full day by just roaming around the marina bay. The view, lots of tourist and specially view at night make it super cool place . But the prices around the restaurant over there was bit crazy high . cool place . ",5,
"Yes it is enormous and located in the perfect spot, but it is too big. The rooms are just normal hotel rooms nothing spectacular but they are clean and of course have spectacular views because of the location. The rooftop pools are amazing but not really for swimming as everyone is there to take selfies. Glad I stayed there once however probably wouldn’t go back.",3,
"This hotel is a must even if for one night.  We stayed one night and definitely amazing though wouldn't go back again.  Let me explained.  This hotel is just massive, three hotels in one, only 20 minutes from the airport by taxi around $15-$20 Singapore. You have to make sure you tell the taxi driver which tower otherwise you will have a big walk to the correct lobby.  A big tip is within 24 hours of arriving you can book in online.  This will save you massive amounts of time in the line.  If there is a big line which there was when we arrived I just asked a staff member that I had booked online and he put me straight into the checkout counter.  Ask for an upgrade we did get one which was nice, was our first time so that could have been why.  The rooms are nice and clean though…",5,
If you are looking for the most posh place to stay in Singapore the Marina Bay Sands should be on you top 3 list. They definitely will not disappoint you with the lush hotel rooms and day/night swimming in the infinity pool and all the best sights and scenery around the city. I suggest you check the bookings availability every now and then to find deals and choose mid week not weekend.,5,
"So far, Singapore is the cleanest place I have ever visited. There are a thousand and one things to do in Singapore and more than a thousand and one places to visit. One of these is Marina Bay Sands. The place is just totally mesmerizing! To fully comprehend what I mean, just go now! Take a break from your work, book a flight, and go!",5,
We visited Singapore as a family from Melbourne and Marina Bay Sands has definitely met our high expectations! The room was a generous size with all the facilities you’d expect. Beautiful shops and restaurants at our doorstep. The staff very friendly and accommodating. A special mention to life guard Ryan Goh at the Infinity pool who was so friendly and offered to take family photos for us! The level57 Sky deck and pool was spectacular and breathtaking. Nothing like it anywhere else. Worth staying here just for this experience! Regards Patricia,5,
Beautiful resort and casino. Singapore has a very strict rules as far gambling for their citizens. foreigners have to show and leave their passports showing that they are not residents. the country does not want them to get the gambling bug.  The resort has every exclusive shops anyone can desire. they have a Ice skating also.  You can even rent high end exotic cars to experience at the time approx. $250.00 . Sounded interesting but we didn't have time to schedule that. Plus all the usual amenities the other resorts would have just a cut above. As far as when we there it was back 2014. i don't think any has changed since then.,5,
"A luxury hotel, different from where a normal person is used to stay. All facilities were good, from the food services to the luggage store. The room was clean, which is quite fundamental for me and is not as commonplace as one can suppose, even among many stars-hotels. My husband and I enjoyed also a poolside dinner and a breakfast and we found them really good, especially the breakfast, which was abundant, diversified and very good quality. The spectacular sight, both from the pool and from our 39thFloor-room added points to the hotel and allows, for me, the achievement of the fifth star.",5,
"Among best hotels in Singapore, we have often chosen to stay at the impressive Marina Bays Sand. I especially would like to express my thanks to Mr Eric at the check in counter. I lucky have meet him 2 times. He is so helpful ❤️",5,
The architecture is very unique and beautiful. It can be seen from almost anywhere in Singapore. Very huge resort. The swimming pool at the top is very impressive and so was the view. Very polite and helpful staff. From the top you can get a view of the Gardens by the Bay,5,
"We stayed here for just one night last week for a stopover in Singapore. We have always wanted to stay in the hotel, but agreed that one night was enough.   I must say that there were many positives with our stay: - We arrived at 9:30am when the check-in time was 3pm. We went in asking if we could just leave our bags, but they allowed us to check-in, even though our room wasn't ready we were really pleased as it allowed us to avoid the queues later on.   - The room was lovely, we had a premier harbour view room which I would highly recommend. You see a lot of the city from the infinity pool, so having a harbour view allowed us a different perspective from the room, and a view of gardens by the bay and beyond. Bathroom was beautiful!  - We ate our dinner at Spago by Wolfgang…",3,
"This is one of the iconic hotels in Singapore. Must stay at least 2 nights to enjoy the upper deck observatory it gives you an awesome view of Marina area, Singapore river, Raffle’ Place, City Hall and Merlion area and of course the infinity pool exclusively to hotel guests, it’s a great way to relax with a city view evening time and early morning. Explore below The Shoppes for luxurious brands, coffee & tea shops, and the latest show at Mastercard theatre. Don’t forget to try out local food at the food court - Rasapura. There’s a laser/fountain show every night and it’s free, do check the timing online! ",5,
"Stayed here again last month - the last time was couple years back?  Lobby space has gone less spacious with more and more empty spaces getting popups everywhere, made the place look more crowded  Wifi is actually quite terrible - for MBS standards I would have expected better. Either it's difficult / unable to connect, or just basically slow. Unless it's wee hours.  Rooms are basically well-maintained, nothing much has changed, still fresh clean rooms. Still a very good choice of hotel if you're not picky about Wifi.",5,
Jeremiah L Malaysia 427 Reviewed yesterday RETURN Very helpful staff during checkin. Room was clean and bright Given Tower 3 . Good view. Working table was of good size. The maintenance staff was efficient when have problem with the toilet. Came to the room within 7 minutes after my call. Towels was replace and changed daily. After I check out I realize I lexft my diary in the room after 6 days. Call the hotel and was requested to have a report taken over the phone. Very efficient got an email message that my diary was found with all the cash intact. Offer to forward back to me but since I am visiting Singapore again for a business trip decided to pick it up myself. Collection was very efficient and staff handling was polite.,5,
"I stayed for one night here.  I decide to upgrade to Club55 area, so I got a bigger room and access to the Club55 with canapés at evening and all free drinks (incl. champagne) also amazing breakfast. Additional here should tea time for Club55 members.  The hotel is really really big, so long distance from reception and depends which tower (1 or 2 or 3) you are staying.  I arrived arround 6ich (pm) and no waiting time at check in.   The room was not really high floor but really big and even if daily change of guest I did not see this in the room. I took a room with view into city, also they offer view to gardens and Harbour.  The bathroom was amazing big with shower room and bathtub.  Access to Infinity Pool until 10pm. Also you can use gym.  All staff was amazing helpful…",5,
"Yes it’s huge, yes it’s expensive but honestly I would say it’s such a unique experience that it’s worth it. The swimming pool is just incredible, we went around 9 o clock in the morning and it wasn’t too crowded with plenty of sun beds available. However it’s a different story at night when it does get extremely busy. The other side of the pool deck is a lot quieter and has jacuzzis and plenty of shady spots. Drinks at the bar were excessively expensive but you were paying for the surroundings I guess. We didn’t have the buffet breakfast so can’t comment on it but we did go to the coffee shop/ bakery in the atrium and it was very reasonable. It’s impossible to get a personal service from such a large hotel but every member of staff we met was extremely helpful, friendly and…",5,
Iconic hotel very good public areas staff are amazing location superb had a club floor room which was very spacious and modern plenty of light and great views. Very good transport connections with the MRT and local buses. Great selection of restaurants close by.,5,
"We stayed 1 night in this hotel because I wanted to swim in the rooftop pool. It was a very expensive swim but definitely  worth it. We had a room on the 45th floor in Tower 1 facing the bay. We were able to check in early and get access to the pool even though our room was not ready. TIP, keep your swimmers in a day bag not your luggage. We stayed at the pool for 5 hours , relaxing, having drinks and poolside lunch. We eventually went down to check out our room and it was amazing, huge, a great view with floor to ceiling glass. It was so nice and relaxing we decided to have room service and just enjoy the light show on the bay.  The bathroom is huge with a lovely big bath. The service at check in and out was very good. Would I stay here again, probably not, because for me it…",5,

"Great Place, really impressive architecture, walking distance to the Sky Garden and central Singapore. The pool on the cantilever roof is fantastic with bars and restraints up there as well. What an experience has to be done but 3 days is enough as its not really a holiday destination more a short city Break. Fantastic Food City wide.",5,
"This hotel was there in the bucket list for its pool and the location. It is in an amazing location in Singapore and has the best views on either side of the hotel. The place is a freak for shopping, things to do and whatever else you could think of in Singapore. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is the highlight of the hotel. It is without doubt the pool with the best view in the world! The hotel is obviously expensive but it is every bit worth it. Th rooms are huge and comfortable.",5,
"We booked and paid for accommodation for 2 adults & 3 children. Upon arrival we were told the rooms could only take maximum of 4 people. They offered us a 2nd room, with one room in Tower 1 and the other in Tower 3, we objected of course, so we eventually got two rooms & on the same floor but at opposite ends of the Tower. We were then charged $110 for a trundle bed because both rooms were only doubles. So my husband & one child stayed in one room & myself & two kids in the other. Very disappointing to say the least for the money we paid to stay here - another let down was the rooftop pool which was not cool & refreshing at all it was hot like a bath & the kids didn’t want to swim in it anymore after one swim only. Money better spent elsewhere I think - we won’t be back...",2,
"This Hotel is honestly amazing, the rooms are spacious, beds extremely comfy and bathrooms lovely. The location is also great with both the MBS light show and the Garden light show close by. If you get a garden view you can see the trees at night - view was amazing, we was on floor 37. Staff were helpfull and allowed us to check in at 12.00. Fantastic experience. A little pricey considering you do not get breakfast and cant use facilities after the check out but thats the only downside everything else is perfect, especially the views. Located close to mrt - must use this! Amazing and so easy to get around.",4,
"This hotel had been on our radar for years, so we had to stay at least one night when we finally made it to Singapore, although it was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed at.  The room and bathroom were big, good amenities, and comfortable bed. Great view of the marina. Impressive architecture. Staff were very professional and provided excellent, attentive service.  Th infinity pool was crowded, but the views were worth it. There was an adults only section of the pool which we appreciated. In addition to the pool, there are also hot tubs on the opposite side. The observation deck also had great views.  Overall worth the hype, one off the bucket list, but definitely an exceptional splurge.",5,
All the surroundings just superb whether you are there during the day or night. So much to see and do. Easy to get to by public transports or to walk there if you stay in hotels along Singapore River.   Is a must visit if you are in Singapore.,5,
I recommend every visit to Singapore must go to sky bar ... it’s $20 per pax but you get that back in return for your drink tab ... the views are magnificent and definitely have a Singapore sling 💕 also the sky flyer wheel is well worth it ,5,
"The hotel itself is huge, comfortable, spacious, architecturally superb. The pool is amazing, nothing else like it anywhere else. Unfortunately check in took 30 minutes. The staff seem to have far too much documentation to do, with rigid protocols. You would expect a booking done by the same person at the same time for 2 rooms would automatically ensure both rooms were in the same tower, but no. This seemed to be a problem, and the poor girl & her supervisor struggled for ages to make this happen. Thankfully they did, and after that the stay was great.",3,
Marina bay sands was about the only place good in Singapore. The views from the top of the hotel is amazing. At night go to a restaurant or bar to see the city skyline. Good shopping and great garden bay. Nice place to go,5,
We stayed at the hotel for the infinity pool which was amazing. Though it was always crowded that made it uncomfortable. Staff had great service. Buffet food was extremely delicious. Shopping centre within the same complex was convenient and had a lot to offer. I will stay again but would be great if the pool wasn't as crowded.,4,
We stopped here for one night (7th October 2018) and we wished we had booked another night!  The room was lovely - so big and spacious and we had a city view.  We were on floor 27 so the views were excellent.  The shower room was also very big.  Facilities were good - the mini bar had a good selection of spirits/beer.  Dressing gowns and slippers were provided and there were also tea/coffee making facilities.   We used the infinity pool which was rather crowded but we got some really good photos during the day and at night when it was empty.  We stopped in the Ce La Vie Bar for a good few hours - drinks were not cheap but the views of Singapore at night were worth paying the bar prices!  I would definitely stay here again if I visit Singapore in the future.,5,
"Absolutely World Class was an absolute bargain approx £100 each from just after mid day to 6pm, continual flowing champagne, - not the cheap stuff mind... The food was amazing, the view was too good to be true, and the service was definitely 5 star. We were not staying at the hotel but had a day pass, was fantastic!!! you have to go there to appreciate the view of the city...",5,
"Excellent hotel, the experience when you reach your hotel room and the view to Beautiful Singapore w/ special touch of Marina Bay Sands is unique! Excellent very spacious rooms, beautiful decor, amenities and the overall experience of The many activities at Marina Bay Sands is priceless! The scent around Marina Bay Sands is so fresh, the customer service is above and beyond - it is AN Experience!! The Infinity Pool, Jacuzzi on top floor is very unique!  A must visit and you can only access it if you are a hotel guest!",5,
"Where to start. What a let down Marina Bay Sands is! It’s a huge corporate hotel which frankly hasn’t been updated since it opened & was the biggest let down of our trip.   Service standards not great  Room wasn’t ready on arrival (despite arriving after check in time) Internal decor very worn in bars & restaurants  Pool area a complete let down - over crowed. Crap (and expensive) drinks  Breakfast was ok, maybe we expected more   Overall thoughts. Wish we’d stayed at the Mandarin Oriental   Return visit. NEVER!",2,
"We arrived ~ 8.30pm late in mid October on a Friday night (paid S$493.16 Inclusive of Taxes directly through the MBS website) and were upgraded by the friendliest reception staff, Glenn to King Deluxe Room 1181 (originally booking for a Deluxe Twin) with a beautiful view over the Super trees. No complaints there obviously.   The room was lovely and the bags delivered very quickly so we quickly headed up to the infinity pool. After all this was the reason we booked the room! The website indicates that there is a Night Escape @ Infinity Pool promotion available daily from 8pm – 10pm. None of the staff knew about it and we kept getting directed to different places until we gave up and just ordered Mojitos. Rather weirdly there was a specific bench that you must be seated on to…",4,
"The Christmas Tree in the foyer sums up the hotel, Amazing, Pool Breathtaking, Shopping fantastic, Food to die for, Restaurants, views, rooms, cleanliness, staff conceige, just so so helpful! Yeah, it’s expensive but it’s worth every penny. Overlooking Super Tree Grove, light show in the evening OMG, City Tour on bus and cruise the quays and Marina. Faultless, do it, you won’t regret it, honest!",5,
"Was at spago yesterday night having a drink. Extremely cheese off by the services by the service crew. Maybe because I am Asian. They do not give a damn to me. Everyone are so focus on serving the westerners. Given that my mum is a paiza member in mbs, and I was seated with Andrew mac just in an event a fortnight back at the same table. Well. Tks to JR and Eugene. Manage to savage the situation from the service girls. Did a great job and serve me the menu drinks etc. the rest. Couldn’t be bothered! ",1,
"It’s difficult to describe the experience.... the hotel is lovely, views are breathtaking, room was sensational and we were upgraded to a beautiful suite as we were celebrating our anniversary.  The not so good experience came after we asked in the Club55 to use showers as we wanted to enjoy to pool after checking out. They offered us to use the gym facilities but forgot to mention that after check out you can’t use anymore the pool. The manager on duty was truly rude and arrogant. We finally managed to get the room checkout extended for a few hours, but as soon as we came back to the club to just wait for our taxi, we were straight away told that we had to pay for our drinks, which was not a problem, but considering the bad experience and amount of time they wasted on us,  any…",1,
"Good to experience staying in this hotel but expensive. The location is great as they have direct access to Gardens by the Bay and the mall/shops in Marina Bay Sands. You must definitely take advantage of the infinity pool, and it has great views on nearby buildings. Our room has a view of the Marina Bay sands mall and at night we saw the light show from there.",5,
"Hi guys,  So I would like to review my stay at Marina Bay Sands.  **Firstly,  The check-in and Check-out- If u have small kids or old age- they will directly take you to the vip counter for the same.  Try your luck by asking them for a free upgrade and most likely you are to get one. Also, higher the floor better the view, so do insist on allocating a room on the higher floor (in ur selected category of room) The suite rooms have Gardens by the bay view from the washroom and City view from the living and the bedroom.  They have 3 tower bldgs.- Does not really make a difference as to where you are allocated, but my preference would go to  Tower-3.  **Room view ::   Please refer the hotel website for clear understanding of each room type and view.  In short, Gardens by the Bay…",4,
Our 2nd visit and I have figured out that this great hotel has managed the impossible - quality AND quantity. It is a great destination in itself with so much to do and with really helpful staff. It is a massive hotel but you don’t feel like you’re just a number. The sheer number of quality cafes and restaurants and the pool at the top just polishes it off nicely. Definitely looking forward to visit number 3.,5,
Not sure if it’s a hotel or an attraction?  You can tell it was built and design by a Vegas hotel group! Rooms are of good size and beds are comfortable. The pool is huge with amazing views but there are a lot of people so trying to get a sun bed can be a bit difficult- and this was on an overcast day!   Another one ticked off the bucket list! ,5,
"We stayed here as a family of three in September. The hotel was in a great location with direct access to both Gardens by the Bay and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. The check in was very smooth and we were quickly checked in as soon as we arrived around 11:00am. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. Our room was located on floor 11 facing the marina which offered a great view, especially with the floor to ceiling window. The rooms were spacious and modern, offering everything needed. The pool is definitely the main attraction here, with was fantastic. The view was great and plenty of sun loungers, as only residents have access to this area, which is highly monitored by staff. Also with an adults area only. There is also plenty of places to eat and drink on the rooftop…",5,
"It is an iconic hotel with amazing views from the very very crowed pool, it is fine but in my opinion is not worth the price.  The best thing at the room was the view to the gardens, we were at the 55th floor, so that  view was amazing.  Had few pricey cocktails at the rooftop (around 26 plus taxes), at least they were decent. The service not so much.  I mean the room was ok, ours was with a connecting door so you could hear the neighbours. The bed comfortable and all... but nothing was worth the price, nothing special but the view. It feels like a casino hotel... wait of course it is a casino hotel.  We payed around 400 usd per night and didn't include breakfast... ;(",3,
"I originally wanted to go to MBS because of that infinity pool and I was willing to pay over $500AUD for the one night! Seriously seriously worth it... the views of Singapore that I got, the comfort of the hotel rooms themselves and of course that pool! I can’t wait to go again and hopefully this time be able to split the room rate with someone else. The staff were all so lovely, helpful and attentitive. You get access to the Sands Sky Deck and you can go at anytime from your room to level 57 anytime. I got lucky with an east facing balcony so I got a view of the Gardens by the Bay and the sunrise! Thanks Sands for an awesome time.  ***one verry happy customer***",5,
"My wife and I stopped here for a pre cruise stay. We decided at last minute to switch from a traditional hotel to this one as it is truly iconic symbol of Singapore  The hotel has a bit of a “Vegas” feel about it. It is a huge sprawling resort in itself. However our room was extremely well equipped with a great view of Gardens by the Bay and the water. We visited the rooftop pool and restaurant, as well as the light show  Overall thoroughly worthwhile and feels like we’ve stopped now in probably 1 of the top 5 hotel icons in the world",5,
"As touristic as beautiful place to see. Skyline is amazing and the light show too, every night at 7 and 8pm. Don't miss the chance to have a cocktail on the wonderful bars placed at 57th floor, you will never forget it!",4,
Great place to stay. very friendly staff and nothing was too much. even relocation to an other room as initially booked was no problem at all. Coming in the room the luggage was already in the room while check - in took only about 5 minutes.  The room itself was very spacious with a sitting area and amazing view over the city. all amenities were present . Nothing you could wish for that was not present.  Furnitire was very new and clean as also the carpet.  And for the first time in any hotel enough wall outlets to charge telephones and laptop. Swimming pool at the top was impressive.  Point of attention: breakfast at the top does not give you a view.  We had a great stay and will be back,5,
"Marina Bay sands is the crowning jewel of Singapore. The hotel is luxurious and the casino is professionally managed. The roof top swimming pool , bar and the restaurants are classy. Must visit when in Singapore!!",5,
"Recently my wife, myself, my brother in law and his wife had a two-night stay at Marina Bay Sands at what was the culmination of a trip-of-a-lifetime for us. We picked Marina Bay Sands because of the perceived prestige and 5-star service we could expect there. Sadly we were mistaken.  As indicated, our stay was from 30/11/2018 until 01/11/2018. The booking numbers were MB15AB4DCA94 and MBB8F5256721. I should have read the warning signs when I noticed your website says the cheapest price on the internet, but that is BEFORE you add taxes and service charges. I find this practice to be outright deceiving. But still, we wanted to stay at the world famous ""Marina Bay Sands"".  On our arrival were made to wait 45 minutes to be served at the check-in counter, after travelling for the…",1,
What a gorgeous and unique hotel located in the beautiful Marina Bay area of Singapore...my husband and I booked a club room for one night to kick off our 1yr anniversary vacation and it was SO worth it! From the separate club lounge check-in area to the food...overall service...rooftop bar & infinity pool...spectra light show...etc. etc. it was amazing! I felt like I had stars in my eyes from the sheer beauty of everything we experienced at this hotel. Would HIGHLY recommend and absolutely want to return!!,5,
"We only got to spend 1 night here, but would do it all over again. Beautiful hotel, stunning view from our room, gorgeous bathroom, roof top pool amazing. love love love this hotel... Room service was, impeccable also, a first class hotel that everyone must experience.  Next time I will be staying longer....",5,
"A very well know hotel, with the infinite ruff top pool. Much more beyond this. It’s huge, and all the spaces are occupied with incredible piece of art. There is a wall cover by a steel mash that moves with the wind. Restaurants as you like, a mall with all shops that one might wanna visit. The rooms are quite regular, but if you stay above 20 floor with a city view that can cause some impact. The service is what one expect from a hotel like this. The roof top. You gonna have your breakfast there, and is a very good breakfast. Lots of options, again, from any part of the world. Luxuriously served. The night club is in this floor to! And the famous pool. I confess that impressed me much more from outside that from inside. But it’s incredible anyway. A little crowd.",4,
"It started with a 45-minute wait to be served to check in then it just got worse and worse. Screwed up our booking and could not put us on the same floor as the couple we were travelling with. Then could not offer our friends a garden view room and tried to pass off the lower grade city view as a ""free upgrade"". Eventually after much arguing both couples have garden view rooms with us on the 39th floor and the other couple in a smaller room on the 22nd floor. No offer of refund or compensation.   Then the problems started! They managed to balls up all our bags and sent our bags to the other couples room and vice versa. That took another hour or so to sort out and when I complained about the service they would not reply to me and only changed the subject.  We decided to meet…",1,
3 towers with a structure boat on top of the hotel. One of the most extravagant building I saw in singapore. But very crowded everywhere. A lot of tour groups even at the lobby. Good thing that singapore is safe. Hope that security in the hotel is really tight with the amount of people passing in through in the lobby.,4,
"You should stay at least a  night to use all facilities and experience the giant superb service. So organised and perfect, everything is perfect. Yes, a lot of people around the pool (and we all there for the same reason ;) )  , but all worth it! Plenty of places to eat, and great if you watch a video on youtube how this hotel was build, how restaurants function with the help of most famous chefs. Didnt take breakfast as used a coffee shop 'Sweetspot' which is great and has everything you may want, plus delicious desserts. Pool can use with cards of the room and kids area is separate from adults. Can be chilly on a cloudy day as I dont think its heated..  Use some of the bars around the pool for a lovely experience. We had a room over 30th floor overlooking the Gardens, so we…",5,
"One of the most exceptional resorts we’ve ever visited worldwide. Our stay at the Marina Bay Executive Suite was full of luxury, comfort and upper class facilities. No need to say that the views from the both sides of the suite were just stunning. Unique Singapore skyline view from our bedroom and living room; Uninterrupted harbour and ocean view from our floor to ceilings windows in the bathroom. If you choose a club room or a suite, then the access to Club55 Bar-Restaurant will transform this place to your everyday afternoon addiction. Canapés & Champagne at their best...",5,
"Definitely loved this hotel very super high service and standard how to deal with the guest, the hotel is really spectacular we got a super club room in the tower 2 and view with the city floor 40 that’s all, our check-in very high style and very friendly too that is the more important. With the infinity pool upstairs access and few free drinks from 5pm to 7pm was the perfect hotel for enjoy high quality with view and nice atmosphere. Will definitely come back to Singapore just for stay in the hotel. ",5,
"Marina Bay Sands, Singapore needs no Introduction for it awe inspiring architecture. I have had a stay at this place last year when I visited Singapore. We got our room on the 20th floor and I must say I was amazed with the view of the room. The rooms is neatly designed with twin bed and comfort cushion. All the amenities of the room were available as promised on the website. Room service was excellent, security for the guest is impressive. There is an inifinity pool on the 57th floor of the Hotel which gives beautiful panaromic view of the city. I would be looking forward for a stay here again when I am in Singapore in the future.",5,
"A Luxury hotel with infinity pool. My advise is to go to the infinity pool earlier to avoid the peak hour to enjoy the view, it can be really crowded during peak hour. Not a pool to swim but a pool to see Singapore's skyline.",5,
I had a great experience at Marina Bay Sands. The room where I stayed was admirably clean and the staff were kind and helpful. I loved the breakfast buffet with varieties of food. The infinity pool was extraordinarily superb. The Marina Bay Sands is a place where you have to stay at if you love traveling with quality facilities with great hospitality. Thanks to Marina Bay Sands management and the staff.,5,
"This is a beautiful place. It’s near natural garden, so relax and take a good photo. Room’s very clean and so amazing but bath room is very basic.Room service was expensive but quite good. The swimming pool is simply amazing. It’ very comfortable to travel another place because it’s near Restaurant, Department-store, Art Science Museum, Bar & Club.",3,
the most excellent place in singapore. a place where I can truly get the service. Hotel work at a higher level. The view from the swimming pool is simply amazing. The price for the level of this hotel is low. especially pleased with the most delicious dinner from the chef!💪💪💪,5,
Booked a room for my birthday celebration.  We had a really nice view by the garden.  Very romantic!  Service is excellent.  We didn’t have to go anywhere because shops are already within the hotel.  Highly recommendable!,5,
"We loved staying here! We splurged for our 5-year anniversary since we are usually budget travellers. You must wake up early to take good pictures. We woke up around 6:30 am and took great pictures with good lighting and without many people! We had room service which was expensive but quite good. We just split 1 breakfast and it was enough for 2 people. You come here for the infinity pool and to take good pictures, so enjoy!",5,
"From the checkin to the service provided at every turn this is top shelf experience.  Our room was amazing and everything in it exceeded our expectations. I sometimes felt like we were the only guests with the attention we received. The views of Singapore are unparalleled. The pool is even better than advertised and the food was amazing. The breakfast buffet at Rise had me anticipating waking up to eat each day. I would definitely stay here again. While the costs are not cheap, it is worth it.",5,
"Fantastic panoramic views of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and Supertree Grove, etc.from observation deck on 57th floor. Infinity Pool, world's largest rooftop infinity pool same deck. Also super views from our balcony on 45th floor. Best view in Singapore of ""Supertrees"" - supersized man-made trees 75 to 150 ft high. Excellent service, food, room service food, etc,(should be, hotel expensive, but first class and worth a visit). Many bars and restaurants of all ethnicities, loved Spago and Ce La Vi on the observation deck the best. Disappointing, business center not in hotel, but in convention center adjacent.",5,
"We had a wonderful 4 day stay here. Our room was amazing, spacious, comfortable with balcony views of the beautiful Gardens by the Bay. The light show was fantastic at night.  The infinity pool on the 57th floor was a must see and can get crowded..  I got up early one day to see the sun rise and others had the same idea but still quiet at that time of the morning.. Amazing to be swimming so high above with the skyscrapers around you.. Food and drinks at the restaurants and room service are pricey.",5,
"The hotel met all our expectations. All the staff worked tirelessly as a team to ensure we were looked after during our stay. Our room was a Club City View located on the 49th floor, and it was awesome. The benefits of your Club55 package really enhanced our experience. The infinity pool was amazing, and the catering exquisite. Lots of photo's from outside also to remember it all by. Thank you MBS.",5,
"My hubby and I are generally pretty budget travellers, but the one place we wanted to stay on our recent Singapore/Thailand holiday was Marina Bay Sands. We do not regret the decision! Yes, it's super expensive, but it's totally worth it to be able to swim in the world's most incredible infinity pool. If you aren't a guest, you can't use it. We were here 2 nights...the place is huge and glamorous. We found the staff really lovely, the room was great (lovely view of Gardens by the Bay too) and seriously I still cannot get over the pool! We had the best time!",5,
"That’s just it. I probably would never be able to afford to stay here. I had the privilege of staying in the hotel thanks to a friend who was attending a trade fair. Her room had two double beds and had the fantastic view of the Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline.  Immense. Imposing. Incredible. The sails of the Marina Bay Sands is indeed a sight to behold. The infinity pool at the Skypark and the Ce La Vie discotheque, ‘featured’ in the film, Crazy Rich Asians were among those that I sought to check out.  No breakfast was taken in the hotel - in my case - despite the array of restaurants featuring celebrity chefs. I carefully guarded my purse and stayed stuck to an already very tight budget.  Location is ideal to see the best of what Singapore has to offer for the first time…",5,

Bath room very basic. quite disappoint it doesn`t have shower handle. After all is clean and proper. Going up to the pool all the way long you have to que up n waiting the elevator. crowded with people going up and down. ",3,
"it was my first time staying at here. I decided to stay here for my birthday so I thought I’d spend a little more than I usually do on hotel rooms. The hotel was beautiful and thought it was put together perfectly. I love their restaurant/bar collection, definitely a world class dining experience. If you decide to stay here expect to pay a little more for an elevated service.",5,
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for my husbands birthday and my husband was bullied and harassed by the life guard because he was wearing a t-shirt in the pool the problem was there where multiple people wearing t-shirts in the pool but he was the only one dragged out as he was not there race. I called the manager and they done nothing about it. They came to our room as we were checking out to bring a cake for my husbands birthday little to late. I would never recommend this hotel  to anyone considering how much it cost and for the terrible service and the way my husband was treated. They absolutely ruined my husbands birthday.,1,
"The hotel is simply amazing. We were checked in and was able to get a late check out till 12pm, which help because our flight is 2pm the next morning. They also offer that we can use their health club's shower to freshen up after check out which was very useful too.  The room is amazing and clean, we have level 6. Which was a concern at first because I thought the view wasn't going to be great but it was unreal to feel so close to the Cloud Forest dome and the Gardens by the Bay. The room have a mini bar but unfortunately there no space to put your space in there if require, if you remove a bottle from the bar it will be charge automaticity, however you can call the front desk and get someone to check and reverse it, if it was remove by mistake.  The infinity pool is probably…",5,
Stayed at the marina bay sands after watching a doco on the building. The building is truely amazballs with superb views from probably the best rooftop pool in the world. The size of the place with thousands of guests means service is average ,3,
We had a great experience here. The pool and bar at the top is awesome. The rooms are big and spacious. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I've ever been to. I would definitely go back just for the pool and buffet. Exploring the shoppes was fun too,5,
"Just had breakfast on floor 57 overlooking the bay. Glad we were up early as it was busy when it opened at 0700. And Already many people in the infinity pool next to breakfast.  It’s a busy hotel, staff are welcoming and as you expect very well run. Well worth the money and Bling!",5,
Marina Bay Sands is an exceptional hotel offering first class service and amenities. Staying in the Orchid Suite on level 45 was amazing! The rooms were furnished in a modern and contemporary way. The room was very large and clean also offering spectacular sweeping views of Singapore. The bathrooms were also modern and contemporary with Roberto Cavalli  toiletries. The club 55 had great food and drinks as well as an amazing infinity pool with sweeping views of the skyline. Marina Bay Sands is one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed at and we will definitely recommend!,5,
"I was Stayed in MBS during ITB Asia and truly saying it is really worth it to stayed in Marina bay sand hotel. Check in, House keeping, Room amenities, pool, Lavo restaurant and all other services was excellent.",5,
"Superb! Attended ITB Asia at Marina Bay Sands Singapore from 16-19/10/18. Had a special designated area to check in . The check in staff, Ms Wati was very helpful. She even help me to get the smoking room which i paid extra charge on this. The room, was spacious and along the corridor of the floor, the ambiance smells good! Mr Sien Le, the housekeeping staff who keeps our rooms tidy, he was very very helpful and courteous. I definitely appraise of his job well done. The Sky deck at 57 had the best view of Garden by the Bay and the pool was amazing!",5,
"Everything was as expected. Nice shopping, a trip down the casino just for fun.  Didn’t manage to swim though due to the crowd. Great view. Would recommend if u love a lively environment. For those who prefer a more private environment, would not recommend. 😄",4,
Went for a family staycation. Superb location to gardens by the bay (5-8mins walk away). My hotel room faced the other side away from gardens by the bay but I get to see river views and city skyscrapers. Easily accessible to other places via underground MRT transport system.   The room was spacious and equipped with amenities. Loved the views from our hotel room. Affordable food options I recommend food court at the Shoppes to try local delicacy. Must visit nearest attraction would definitely be gardens by the bay- flower dome and cloud forest.  ,5,
"Well worth a stay just to experience *that* pool. The hotel itself is comfortably 4 star but the pool would be 6. Yes it is crowded and can be a 'soup' full of those with selfie sticks but the sensation and views are just mindblowing especially late in the evening (open to 11). The rooftop bar within the hotel is similarly stunning at night. The rooms are average though the gym is well equipped and spacious. The connection of lifts is confusing at first. Last and definitely least, a queue of up to 20 minutes every day for breakfast is just not acceptable at this level; particularly given the adjacent conference centre and need for delegates to eat and go quickly.",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is first of all an architecture wonder, a place representing the triumph of the mankind as building such a hugh hotel, business and tourism complex is definetely something extraordinary. With the shape of a giant ship, the complex has three towers and an enormous deck linking them all and hosting a 150 m long pool, restaurants and more. The views from the pool and generally from the deck are amazing. Rooms are spacious and offer themselves as well beautifull views (we had the views over Gardens by the Bay and the ocean) but they are not amazing design wise. Restaurants in the complex are numerous and of a high quality as regards the dinner and good as regards breakfast. Service was excellent everywhere but I trust it is as it should be considering the price. The…",5,
"This is my second visit to this Hotel in 2 years. I just keeps getting better. The hotel itself is ""off the charts"", the views are stunning, and the staff super friendly and efficient. The hotel offers all amenities and of course the rim-flow sky pool 57 stories up. This time round we stayed in a room with the City view.",5,
"How do I put this!  After spending a gorgeous 3 hours in the pool we had paid over $650 a night per room for, our friend who we had been travelling with was rudely pointed out by the lifeguard at the pool in front of EVERYONE! You, You, come here show me your t'shirt! Our friend who had surgery on his arm and had a massive scar and who wasn't confident with his body shape to go without it a T’shirt. The lifeguard yells out no cotton allowed in the pool you take it off or get out! Our friend advised him in a soft tone that he wasn't confident without it so he got yelled at and told that he needed to get out! Mind you, at the same time about a handful of other people with cotton tops and skirts had been in the pool and none of them got pulled out!  What makes this worse is I…",1,
"I didn't know what to expect and thought that it would be all hype but it was quite impressive. It may not be for the business traveler, in terms of value, but romance, family, or solo may be well worth the cost. It is an adventure in that it is so unique and captures one's imagination completely. It is sort of surreal.",5,
"We stayed just one night, fresh in from a very early flight. The staff were friendly and spoke good english.  We tried our luck for an early check in, but room wasn't ready.  That was ok to be expected with such a busy hotel.  We were able to put our luggage into storage and take a look around.  We were told room would be ready by check-in time at 3pm.  But they would email us if it was earlier.  Which they did, we got into our room by 1pm, which we were so grateful for. The most famous infinity pool will blow you away, the main reason to stay here.  Add it to your bucket list, you will not be disappointed.  The gardens by the bay, night lights show, was amazing to be able to watch from our balcony. Just for that, the stay was worth every cent.",5,
"Amazing, beautiful, comfortable for business needs and unbelievable service !! Can't wait to come back.         The personal assistance made the business more comfortable and professional. No doubt will come back",5,
First thing- ghe taxi from airport to hotel vost about 15-20 Singapore dollars and it is about 15-20 minutes away. The hotel is magnifisent! The huge beautiful building seeing from far away. The check in going satisfactory fast. We made reservation for premium room and at check in you leave 400 Singapore dollars deposit which can be used for food and drink at hotel or if you don’t sprend it they are returning it at check out. Our room was great No.3392  We had beautiful front view at the city and great view at the sea and garden from bathroom. Everything comfortable clean perfect! Our cleaning lady - Hua Li made our room every day more and more beautiful. The pool at the top- Infinity pool is really something unique! The hotel has a couple nice restaurants and it is conected to…,5,
"Club room definitely worth paying extra - calm breakfast, canapes and drinks at daytime and champagne in the evening. Weekends are usually very busy so make sure you have your breakfast early to avoid queues. Hotel staff is super friendly and nice! definitely will stay here again!",5,
"We had a basic room on a lower floor, but it was very nice. The staff were super helpful at everything and room service was quick and efficient.  The infinity pool! This was awesome. it was packed but we soon found a great bunch of pooside seats for ourselves and our friends. The poolside service was great too. Drinks and food quick and aplenty.  I'll also review ADRIFT (lobby bar and restaurant) this place is awesome! The service there was so good. The staff were so nice and made sure we had a great time. The cocktails were INCREDIBLE. Did i mention i loved the staff?  Also, we had a few events to attend during the night and the hotel put us in contact with a sitter service that guests often used. - the service is not part of the hotel - We were happy with their recommendation,…",4,
"My experience was super pleasant as I was well looked after by a Worker name Joseph Lee Teck Shan. I bought some wooden chimes and advised what other benefits the hotel offers so I can get a good experience.  He was very patient with me whilst helping me all the way to the roof top where the scenary with great view of Singapore.  Thanks Joseph for your wonderful puzzle gift for our honeymoom.  Regards, Khang Le Sydney Australia",5,
"We stayed one night here before our long flight back to Canada. We stayed on the 61st floor in a King Garden View Suite. The view was Stunning. You have a view of the ocean, Gardens by the Bay, etc. The pool and its ICONIC view overlooking Singapore is breathtaking. Be sure to go early in the morning so you can get a pool side chair as these are a hot commodity! Have a glass or rose and soak up that view! Spago, the restaurant, is a MUST! We had a superb dinning experience. We also tried Lavo which was a total disappointment. The service was AWFUL. we got ignored by our server for 15 minutes after we sat down and he never checked in once we go our meal. The view from Lavo is beautiful but it is completely overhyped. I wish we had booked a second meal at Spago over Lavo. Spago…",5,
Hi we spent two nights in MBS and what two days they were. staff were helpful although it was a long process to check in . Our room was stunning we was on 47 th floor with a city view. World class restaurants and the swimming pool out of this world . Worth visiting gardens by the bay . Well what can we say  EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT 👌,5,
" As a remarkable landmark of Singapore, I recommend this hotel. As you know, it is known for its great infinity pool and definitely it is wonderful. And also the staffs are kind and professional. There are several Korean staffs and they are ready to help you. That is why I tried this hotel twice - first was 2016 and this time. A room condition was okay and met my expectation.   * 수영장 하나만으로도 값어치 한다고 생각합니다. 인피니티 풀에서 보는 뷰는 낮/밤 모두 환상적이니 꼭 챙겨보세요 :) ",4,
"Among a few other attractions to visit Singapore – a stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was a dream too.  We thought we could write raving review about that iconic building and our memorable stay in the lap of luxury.  It turned out to be a bad dream that one never want to experience a second time.  To start with we do not consider this hotel as a luxury offering, not even up to 5 star standards of other hotels in Singapore or elsewhere.   The level of communicative English of customer service employees was very poor.  The amenities provided as toiletries etc. were of cheap quality, the shower (instead of a rain shower) was a low pressure mist spray rather than shower. There was not even a hand shower. When we complained the reception seems to be ignorant what A RAIN SHOWER OR A…",1,
Stating the obvious..... the hotel is huge.  You need a map to navigate.  It can be expensive.  It’s busy and naturally does not have the character of a more historical building.     Having got all that out the way..... enjoyed a great stay.  Garden room with balcony recommended for  - lovely daytime views (not as good in evening) - balcony / fresh air -  bright Light - good for jet lag   If you want a city view - then great at night - but no balcony / patio doors.    Spent much time on the pool deck and drinking the odd cocktail.  Fabulous experience all round.  Recommended  ,5,
"Well what a fantastic piece of architecture this is.   From the accommodation and the infinity pool, all the places to dine, to the casino...wow and more wow.  I loved it. The gardens are beautiful and light up at night for a magnificent light show.  The glass house done, hides beautiful gardens inside..thus whole pkace us wonderful.  You may need more than one day to see and experience it all. Use taxi or train tk get you there... as long as you are not a long way out of the city.  Your tour desk will give you an approx price on the fares.",5,
Had a night here with husband. Its great to able to swim on top of the hotel where you can able to watch all the surrounding of Marina bay. The hotel is massive and its really clean. Even though its quite expensive.,5,
"I stayed one night at Marina Bay Sands with a previous memory of impeccable service and the high-quality facilities. The room is large and comfortable though a bit dusty and the terrace was quite dirty and messy with dried leaves and wilting flowers all over the floor.  Nevertheless, I was tremendously impressed with the view of the room, depicting the majestic light of the Gardens by the Bay. Loved the experience of the Swimming Pool so much though quite crowded. However, I would like to give a big applause to one Life Guard who was super-friendly and offered great assistance (forgot to ask for his name but he is quite senior in terms of age, and he could speak Thai too. He said he worked in Chiang Mai before) He helped offer to take nice photos at the pool for me and had a…",5,

After our flight got canceled we went to front desk at tower one to request for an additional night, night shift attendant mansor said the hotel is at 101% occupancy for the 23rd of October we requested to speak to the duty manger “Ian” came out with one hand in pocket and being bery carless about our situation saying mansor said we are fully booked and nothing can be done all our 2561 rooms are booked. After mentioning that we are a group with 2 sky view rooms and an orchid suite booked for the last 4 nights you except we stay on the street since the flight is cancelled.

"I just experienced the best customer service ever. I stayed at different hotels local and international but, I will give my highest rating in terms of customer service here at Marina Bay Sands. The one that really completed my stay is when I decided to have some drinks at Celavi Club Lounge. Mikko the waiter is very attentive in terms on what I need. He is extremly nice and even offered the best seat and view in the lounge. Very superb service. Kuddos Mikko and keep up the good work!",5,
The Singapore Jewellery Fair was held in one of the Convention Halls in Marina Bay Sands and I was impressed by the spaciousness of the Halls. Toilets were also conveniently located within the Hall as well as just outside. Marina Bay Sands is huge and impressive.,5,
"Good sized room, great views but average value overall considering the price. The service should be spot in but was hit and miss. Some staff certainly were polite and kind but there were some glaring errors that made the stay a little more unpleasant. Queuing to go for breakfast and waiting so long for the elevator was also a problem, too many rooms, not enough facilities to cater. On a more positive note, the restaurant service was good in general. Manager was friendly and smiley. The room/housekeeping service were fine and the city views from the swimming pool on top were breathtaking and made the trip memorable overall. The jacozzi overlooking the garden bay was also superb. Happy overall, but some points need to addressing to make this hotel truly value for money.",3,
"My partner and I stayed here as a treat for my 30th. We originally booked for three nights (twin room by mistake) and added on an extra night which was a double room. When checked in receptionist asked if we would rather have the double room for the duration and changed it which was perfect for us.  Rooms are gorgeous, so spacious and clean.  We had a balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay which was stunning. I miss that view every day!  I had cake for my birthday to return to each night and my bed turned down with slippers ready.  We had our last day at the rooftop pool drinking cocktails all day, it wasn’t too busy and the service was excellent. Drinks so much cheaper than I expected too, we pay much more in the UK for cocktails of that standard.  Spent an hour or so in CE…",5,

Have just come back from an impressive 4 night stay at the Marina Bay Sands. That hotel is pretty damn amazing!! We arrived at midnight after a long flight from NZ and found no queues waiting for us at Tower one. Got a nice wee room upgrade too.  The room was really spacious. And was equipped with all the amenities you could ever want. Even mouthwash. The beds were a little firm though as previous reviewers have mentioned. We also really loved the towel sculptures left by our cleaner each day. Too cute to use! We just loved that pool deck and enjoyed cocktails one night at the Spago lounge and bar - delicious good there too. You are breakfast at the Sweet Spot - really good coffee when Wayne is doing Barrista duty. Delicious pastries and really nice / fresh tropical fruit cups.…,5,
"This is the 3rd time we've stayed at Marina Bay Sands over the past 5 - 6 years. We've seen some subtle changes over this period. Drapes on our window, some furniture & chairs in the Club 55 Restaurant all a little tired looking & showing wear.  We had a club room for 3 nights which has many benefits (particularly if you want to spoil yourself). Disappointingly the check-in process was not one of the benefits taking 30 - 45 minutes which is not pleasant after a 12hr flight.  The chefs at Club 55 do a remarkable job with the variety & quality of food they produce. Amongst the standout staff I would mention Vinson whose good humour & cheerfulness was most welcoming. Then there is Mina, each time we have stayed, we have noticed her tireless work ethic - people like her are…",4,

This is an iconic place to visit. The pool on the rooftop is great and is open until 11pm at night. We have done breakfast at Spago restaurant on the rooftop a few times and it is a great start to the day. Views are amazing. ,5,
Stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon. Worked out about £800 in total with the £100 per night deposit they charge on top of the room rate. Not only this but we don’t get it back for at least a month which isn’t ideal when travelling around. Don’t get me wrong the rooms are nice very spacious etc but not near worth the money especially considering the check in is like a queue in a supermarket and the foyer is mad busy with people/kids everywhere. Also our check in was supposed to be 3pm but our room wasn’t ready until 5 which was very annoying considering we had flew from Ireland. We would have been even more raging if we had of been staying only one night which I’m sure people do because of cost.,3,
We stayed here for our Honeymoon a few weeks ago and it was simply incredible. The staff were amazing from the first moment we arrived right until we left. They were so nice and friendly and just great at their jobs. The food was excellent and the rooms were just amazing. If anyone is considering staying here I'm sure you won't regret it as I wouldn't be able to criticize any aspect of the stay. Five stars all the way!!!  An extra special thanks to Devi the front desk agent who we dealt with as she went above and beyond to get us an upgrade to an incredible room and really made the trip extra special......she deserves a promotion!!,5,
"Despite several follow up emails we are still awaiting our security deposit of 200 dollars. We have received zero response or explanation from the hotel, from looking online at reviews it appears this is a common occurrence. Terrible customer service",1,
"Would thoroughly recommend staying here if you are in Singapore. Great service, enjoyable food, lovely rooms, amazing views and brilliant location.   The swimming pool does get busy (to be expected), and there can be a queue for breakfast on the top floor (not too long though).   Will definitely return.",5,
Undeniably one of the most iconic and most popular hotel in all of singapore. The hotel is huge! And although it is a 5 star luxury hotel. It doesn’t feel like it when entering the lobby. It feels like entering a mall because of the tourist coming in and out of the hotel. I just hope there is a separate lobby for hotel guest to check in and check out.   Got a corner room facing gardens by the bay. The room is huge with spectacular views. Although the room i got has no bathtub. The amenities and the views makes up for it.   Never in my life have I experienced lining up for check in and check out which took me about 10-20mins of waiting.   The skydeck pool was amazing. Possibly the only reason why people stay here. Aside from direct access to the Shoppes. If you want to stay here…,5,
We stayed again in the Marina Bay. But this time my husband and I had a friend with us who visited Singapore for the first time.   First: shuttle service perfect  Second: Sands Suite: amazing(with the pool table! You definitely want the pool table!) Third: service and staff - like always: excellent. His expression: he didn’t get the smile Out of his face ;-)  I absolutely love this hotel and its people. I would always come here again for visit. It feels like coming home. ,5,
"My partner and I stayed here for one night to treat ourselves whilst backpacking. The service was amazing straight away from check in. The room was lovely, we paid extra to have a city view and were put on the 53rd floor, it was so beautiful. We had a lovely dinner at a celebrity restaurant in the Marina Bay Shops, spent time in the day and evening in the infinity pool and even got free cake from the reception sent up to our room. Such a perfect stay and the best 24 hours. Thank you to all the staff. Can’t wait to come back and stay for a week or two!",5,
"This was our second time staying at Marina Bay Sands - we stayed two nights on our way home from Europe to get back on our own timezone.  We arrived in the morning after a 14 flight with our 4yo and we were given a room early and able to head up to the Infinity Pool - the perfect way to stay awake after an exhausting flight.  The rooms are huge and comfortable, service is prompt, helpful and polite and the breakfast at Spago is always a highlight. This time we had a view to the Gardens by the Bay, which are spectacular to see at nighttime. The lower rooms also have a balcony which is a bonus.  Spending two days by the pool at Marina Bay Sands was the perfect way to relax and shake off any jet lag - would highly recommend for a Singapore stopover, or a longer stay. ",5,

"The MBS is obviously one of the world's most iconic hotels. Economic supply and demand considered, I'm not certain it's worth the money (although it does come close).  From the exterior, the hotel was stunning. Regarding the interior, my room was very nice and views from hotel rooms either overlook the Garden by the Bay and its beautiful nightly light shows or the stunning skyline of Singapore city. The lobby, although grand, invoked considerations of an amusement park: huge; long lines (for check-in, check-out, the concierge, etc.); hundreds of people (hotel guests and non-guests taking pics); etc. The lobby was undergoing renovations and some additional cleaning (e.g. the ceiling over reception) is necessary.  The pool was spectacular but was unfortunately crowded on the four…",4,

It was a business trip but luckily I had time to enjoy the facilities in the hotel. The infinity pool is just amazing. There are good restaurants and shops in the hotel area. I didn’t even need to leave the hotel area during my entire stay.

Spacious and wonderfully furnished, one of the most beautiful bathrooms I’ve had. Then the gym with the perfect view, and best of it all is obviously the infinity pool.  Loved every corner of it.",5,
It was a dream for me to stay in Marina Bay Sands when i travel to Singapore.it's one of a kind hotel with an amazing infinite pool overlooking the harbor from the top of the hotel. The location is very good close to Gardens by the Bay which has a stunning light and music show every night. connected to a big shopping mall with varieties of shops and restaurants. The rooms are spacious with luxury amenities. Service with a very high quality from all staff.,5,

Even it’s a 2500 rooms hotel, but the front office agent is professional and keep smiling all the days.   The room located on 33rd floor. The view at the balcony is unbreakable and can see the whole garden by the bay.  I would say the housekeeping did very well and they fill up your amenities based on your personality. Like if I drank all bottle of water on the first day, they refill double of them on the next day.   And the in room dining and pressing service is very professional, they can deliver my order to my room on time everyday.  The infinite pool is a must visit pool in the world and it is much…",5,
"My wife and I stayed here on a two day connection as we explored Southern Asia. Mid October, which is still technically the rainy season so I am guessing a little quieter. The place was busy but not crowded. Of course it is expensive but the staff were wonderful , accommodating and friendly.  We arrived very early and were allowed to check in and were also given the courtesy of a late check out.  Both were much appreciated. Our room was spotless and the view was spectacular. Food and drinks are extremely pricey but again not surprising for one of the most iconic hotels in the world. You only live once folks so if you are on the fence, just do it. Just think of your Instagram feed!",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a weekend in Singapore. The views from the top are unbeatable. The restaurants and bars on the roof are lovely, and we really enjoyed having such easy access to them. We enjoyed a lovely dinner at Lavo (I had a delicious vegetarian meal) and many great cocktails at Spago.  The rooms are a decent size, and the decor is nice, although not trendy - but that's dependent on taste of course!   We found it easy to get around from the hotel. The metro is easy to get to and you can walk to lots of places.  I would say though that it is not a personal hotel and whilst the staff are friendly and I'm sure always happy to help it doesn't feel like you get much service.

From the beginning, we were whisked away into a VIP checkin line and the process was quick. We had a room on the 47th floor looking at the city. The room was modern, spacious, and beautifully appointed. The staff put welcome amenities in our room for our honeymoon. The pool deck is the centerpiece, with commanding views out over the city of Singapore. Pool service was a little slow, but the view made up for it.

In my opinion Marina Bay Sands is where your Singapore visit should begin (and end). I stayed three nights in a Sky View room and simply loved everything about the hotel. I had the pleasure of early check-in and unwinding at the unforgettable infinity pool on floor 57 before exploring further. This is what Singapore is all about. No trip is proper without dipping yourself in those world famous waters. The view is breath-taking and service is very friendly. Food and beversge is very reasonably priced in the pool area.  I had a slight issue in my bathroom but hotel staff was very responsive and it was resolved in the blink of an eye. Very professional. The hotel itself is gigantic but staff is doing its best to accomodate all guests. I have nothing to complain about as everyone…,5,
We had fantastic coffee and cake in one of the foyer cafes. Also went to the bar on the 57th floor. This is above the viewing platform and costs $20 pp admission fee which is offset against any drinks you buy. Beer and a glass of wine both cost about $10-15 so you get to enjoy a drink on the roof top bar and stay to enjoy the view and relax. You can eat there too but we didn’t do that. We purchased our tickets at ground level of tower 3. Better than the viewing platform in our opinion.  Loved it and it was a fabulously bright day.,5,
"The title says it all, as you would probably expected from a hotel this size it cannot offer a personal feel because of the sheer volume of guests it caters to. We stayed in a Club Room with Seaview over the Beautiful Gardens by the Bay. The view is indeed incredible as is the eclectic city, however the staff let themselves down a bit with her excessive efficiency, you cannot break the rules to go above and beyond for guests. I would say the place caters more to the tastes of the business break, and the posers in life. It's clean and functional as you would expect in Singapore. ",4,
Pros: Great views if you are up high (was on 48th floor). Thanks to friendly staff for earlier and quiet check-in and letting me to stay as high as i wanted with garden view on offer. Room was clean and daily serviced. The pool is worth a stay itself. Not too busy. And cant speak enough of great views of Singapore city from 57th floor. Justifies the price you pay. Loved the random photo model lookalikes doing their shoots in the pool area..good value for some laughs!  Cons: shopping and eating out is very $$$! Lucky I wasn't into shopping at Marina Bay Sands and it was fairly easy to eat elsewhere.  Definitely worth a visit but if you don't like people (i mean lots) and are keen shopaholic but don't want spend too much $$ than this is not the place for you.,5,
"Stayed two nights at MBS. Got a room with a view, overseeing Gardens by the Bay. Magnificent view, great services provided. Friendly staffs. Definitely recommended even for a staycation if you are able to splurge for the room upgrade  ",4,
 We are from Sri Lanka We were greeted at the desk wonderfully and were given really nice rooms and close together as we are  4 in 2 room. Nice Views were fantastic although the pool was overcrowded. we used hot tub ,5,
We were greeted at the desk wonderfully and were given really nice rooms and close together as we are a party of four.  Views were fantastic although the pool was overcrowded. I enjoyed the hot tub most of all.  ,5,
"Forget it...toooooo busy and way way over the top, no real people ie average people shop here... versace, ferrari jun ??? While eating very ordinary chinese etc..... talk about showing off ....dont bother, go to Raffles city for a very reasonable meal at reasonable prices",1,
"We had three fantastic nights in the amazing hotel.   This was a stop-off on our way home from a holiday in Bali. We treated ourselves to a Club room which gave us access to Club 55 for free cocktails and canapés each night. This was excellent and very much worth the additional money.   The hotel itself is breathtaking. The whole structure and pool are really amazing ... you have to see it to believe it.   I think we had a better experience because we had paid for the upgrade so the room was bigger and the lounge access was excellent. We didn't have to queue for breakfast like some of the other guests so this was a real bonus.   The views from the hotel are amazing whether you have a city or ocean view. The staff are very efficient, polite, helpful and very professional. My only…",5,
"Our 52nd floor suite was outstanding, as was the service from special check in for customers paying for a suite. Also complementary breakfast, membership of Club 55 with free champagne, canapés etc. 5-7pm.the fabulous infinity pool (the biggest its type in the world, the light shows and great Hospitality made it a very special experience  ",5,
"We stayed here earlier this year in June, whilst at a conference in the near by exhibition center which made it an easy commute.  The hotel is truly expansive ! 3 imposing towers. Check in was not too bad as we arrived quite late. We had a great room with lovely views of the garden lights.The security is visible and you can not enter the lifts to your tower without the key.The staff are friendly and helpful considering its such a huge hotel.  The lobby area is so busy it feels like a train station ,as there are tourists not staying in the hotel coming to the viewing deck. In my opinion this is a once off great experience to see the hotel and take in  the views and the infinity pool which is wow ! ( only available for hotel guests use)personally i did not get into it as it was so…",4,
"I stayed here at the end of September with my sister whilst I was in Singapore for work. The hotel is super sized and because of that it’s exceptionally busy and has an “airport” fee and not at all exclusive. Check in was fast for us but when arriving at our room (Garden View Suite) we were given a room on level 2, so all we could see was a hedge and VERY noisy (like sleeping on the motorway) so I requested a new room. I would recommend anyone to only get a room from floor 9 and above!! This was of course granted with no fuss and I was emailed when the room was ready - we were given complimentary pool room keys while we waited.  We were very shortly advised that a new room on level 54 was available. The room was lovely, super quiet, spacious and luxurious with designer…",3,
The best luxury hotel in Singapore. Amazing views of the hanging Garden. No words for world highest and longest pool. The view of city from the pool makes you feel that you are floating in the cloud. Incredible experience !,5,
"What a big hotel was my thought on the queue for check in. We were an hour in line, though staff passed by every 15 minutes or so with juice, or water, or ice cream. Anything to help make the wait more comfortable. The 3 tower 57 stories high sky scraper is just big. It takes days to get the place, but withe the large infinity pool, great viewd, comfortable rooms, it is a must at least once in Singapore to be there. Best breakfast with a vast choice is in Tower 1 on the ground floor. Best view but with limited view on the 57th floor in Tower 2.",5,
"Excellent hotel,fantastic views but extremely busy. Took 1hour to check in. The infinity pool is stunning but very crowded even in the rain and at 7am in the morning. Because it is so big I probably wouldn't stay there again just because of the crowds.",4,
"Upgraded to a fabolous two bedroom suite with gym, massage room and hairdresser´s inside. Wonderful views over de botanical gardens. Huge living room, dinning room, office facilities, domotic control of lights, televisions, blinders... Private lobby and lift to 50th floor. Butler to catter for ice, nespresso capsules and morning full breakfast. And what else to say about the world famous rooftop swimming pool? Incredible experience!",5,
"People stay here for obvious reasons - the iconic hotel (it’s on most souvenir items and if you google Singapore - this hotel is bound to show up) and the pool.   Actual hotel itself: The hotel itself is average. A subpar, modern, city looking hotel. It is a very big hotel which is split into 3 ‘towers’/sections - 1, 2 and 3. As the hotel is so big, it lacked the ‘personal’ touch.  A bonus for staying here is that you can use the observatory deck for free.   Rooms:  The rooms were ‘meh’. We opted for a city view and in my opinion, that was the best feature of the room. The room decor is nothing to boast about, very old fashioned and outdated - I’ve stayed in nicer rooms for a fraction of the price. We stayed in a normal room and I was disappointed to see that there was no…",4,
"The hotel is of course one of the most high-end hotels in Singapore and that shows. The whole complex speaks luxury, also the easy access to the electric trees and cloud dome is very convenient. Never the less the whole experience comes at a certain price which was in my opinion quite overpriced. Except the pool which in theory can not be accessed by non guests, the rest is publicly accessible and can also be enjoyed while staying in an equally nice but a lot cheaper hotel somewhere else in Singapore.",3,
"So took the pics in the infinity pool and instagrammed it. Not coming back. For two main reasons. First, it’s way overpriced for what it is. Second, it’s way too far away from the city. I’d rather stay in a similar room at the Hilton and pay half the price! The room was ok, nothing special. Infinity pool is nice, but over crowded. Restaurants are ok (tried breakfast and dinner). One thing going for this place is the proximity to the gardens by the bay and the science museum. Overall, nothing special. I can’t see myself going back when there’s enough choice in the city.",3,
"This is simply a great, iconic Singapore hotel that ought not to be missed. Spectacular design from outside and inside. Great rooms. The roof-top pool is a wonder of engineering...try a cocktail while relaxing on the infinity edge, looking over the city. The rooftop bards are great although the staff at Adrift make for an even better experience. We liked the foot in Cést la vie restaurant - and Adrfit. Lavo was OK.",5,
"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I had early morning arrival in SIN so got to Marina Bay Sands reception at around 7 AM. They were nice enough to give me early check-in and upgrade to Premier room for SGD 60 extra. They have deducted equivalent of USD 250 from my debit card as a deposit since I had no credit car on me at the time. Everything went great. The room had a balcony with incredible views of Gardens By The Bay, spacious bathroom and comfortable bed. Rooftop pool and jacuzzi are out of this world. A must-experience kind of thing. But... Months after my stay I was going through my bank statement and noticed that my deposit was never refunded. I left the room spotless so I was sure this is definitely not a consequence of my own actions. I contacted the…",2,
"Visited in November. Great place, great service, infinity pool, great location, superb view. The service were great. They even left a complimentary cake as a birthday treat. You need access for infinity pool. Loads of shopping places within.  Garden by bay is just near by so is merlion park. Singapore light show is another best highlights and marina bay sand is the best place to view it from.",5,
"Honestly, one of the best expetiences ever!! The que for getting up was a little bit too long, but totally understand why people love this place. Would love to swim in the pool - but only for hotel guests unfortunately :(",5,
We stayed at MBS for one night as a once in a lifetime experience even though we live in Singapore! Ryan Goh an amazing help at the pool!! He’s the lifeguard but super helpful for everything related to the hotel and Singapore! Very friendly and approachable - great woth kids - seek him out!! Sheree,5,
We stayed two nights at the hotel as a stopover from Australia to the UK and we had a room on 47th floor with amazing views. The hotel staff were friendly and polite and we had no complaints over our room.  The view from the 57th floor with the infinity pool were simply mind boggling and we took loads of photos. The only thing we did find annoying was the fact that a $20 bottle of rose wine outside the hotel cost $120 in the hotel restaurant which we thought too steep!,4,
"We caught MRT to the Sands. Can also taxi, slightly more expensive (adds S$2-4) as there is a drop off/pickup fee at Sands. loved just walking through this massive building to admire the architecture, shops all too flashy (Gucci, Prada, etc), didn't do the roof top experience as expensive at S$21 adult and you are confined where you can go on the roof top.  They even have a canal in here with boats! We also visited the Art + Science Museum (super awesome) which is located right beside here.",4,
Is not worst to stay too expensive and the service is not very good ....and to visit the pool is only one key card one entrance we stay there is to celebrate my husband birthday..my family came to celebrate together we went to the pool my family cannot get in ...when we book we are not told that to get in to the pool need to have the key card ...,1,
"Loved the stay here totally. After work, I had a lot of places to go around the hotel for a run. The infinity pool is amazing. I loved the complimentary chocolate buffet on the eve (as a room package). Good variety in the breakfast menu. As a hotel guest, I also had a complimentary entry to Gardens By the bay. Overall a wonderful experience. I am taking my family here again during Diwali break!",5,
"It took me some time to think about this review, so that my personal experience of this hotel is fair and not because I was disappointed and jumped in this review. After almost a week, I still came back to the same conclusion. It is definitely not worth the money. We stayed for 2 nights & we did regret it. We became another curious tourist stats wanting to experience the infinity pool and to check the view from above at the Observation deck. If you really do want to check out the hotel, then here are my advice. Take on the City View room and stay there for only one night. Use the pool between 6am - 7:30am if you are planning to actually swim in it. If you are like most of the other guests who are only in the pool for photos, I guess it doesn't matter what time. Tip: At night the…",3,
"I highly recommend this hotel! The rooms, the hospitality, the service, facilities are in the highest level and its definitely worth every single penny!  The pool is breathtaking.. I recommend to choose the highest floor you can get. Don't think twice!!",5,
"My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 8 nights in September (2018) for the Formula 1.  I had previously read reviews that said the check in process could be really slow. We arrived at the hotel at about 5.30 p.m. and had no problems checking in. It was straight forward.  The room we stayed in was  excellent. It was a really good size, very comfortable and could not fault it in any way. It was definitely worth paying the extra for the city view as this was breathtaking. Although, a garden view room would also be good (particularly as you could watch the light show in Supertree grove).  We ate a few times in the hotel (room service and Lavo restaurant). The food was always excellent. Would definitely recommend Lavo as the food was great, not badly priced and the view you…",5,
"This was an amazing hotel. We stayed In a club room. Very spacious, ocean view. Very large bathroom.  Really lovely room. Club room gave us a dining room on floor 55 which gave us free afternoon tea and free drinks and canapés. The staff in here were very attentive , informative and helpful. I can’t say enough . A fabulous 3 days. Don’t forget a trip up to the pool on the roof. You must see it early evening. The view was incredible.",5,
"We stayed here thinking that it might be the only chance we might get. We weren’t disappointed, everything at this hotel was perfect. Just wish we’d had longer to explore the hotel facilities, shops and casino.  The service was excellent from the early check in to the anniversary cake.  Could have stayed in the pool for a whole week and still wanted more.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The only tiny downside is the fact that it is such a huge hotel, with so many guests, that it doesn’t feel personal enough but that goes for far smaller hotels these days too.  Given the chance we would definitely go back, and for longer",5,
We expected a level of service and quality from a hotel with this reputation and price for a room.   It fell flat when we waited an hour in the check in queue where only 3 people were serving.   It was hot in that area and no offer of water until we reached the counter.    The room was ok the shower floor was incredibly slippery to the point of dangerous.   The pool wasn't really clean and water was like a warm bath.   We had to order milk to the room and had to pay for half a jug of milk and not provision in the room.   There was nothing impressive about this hotel that would make me come back. When we advised at check out things were not up to standard there was a totally blank look and no acknowledgement.   It is fair to say I will never be back.  We had stayed at the Pan…,3,
"During our honeymoon stop over at the Pan Pacific Hotel we had extensive views of the Marina Bay from our hotel balcony which made it easy for us to determine where to walk and view the Marina Bay up close. There are plenty of activity options to suit all age groups in, on and around Marina Bay.",5,
"We enjoyed our experience. It is a busy shopping and hospitality operation. Hotel staff are well trained and efficient. Concierge service is world class. Rooms are clean, tidy, sizable and comfortable but lack draw space and a lighting plan that is easy to use. There are plenty of elevators serving the 2600 rooms in three towers. The hotel is accessible to the city and sits on an MRT station. The MRT will put the traveller any where in Singapore quickly and comfortably. The hotel needs more breakfast options as an expensive buffet is not for everyone. We ate breakfast in the shopping complex but found choice limited. Hotel restaurants and bars are excellent but charge world prices. Again, we found their food fantastic and service friendly, courteous and efficient. The roof top…",5,
"Like most reviews, it's all about the pool -how many of us would stay if we could pay a ""day rate"" for access to the pool? I would say the hotel occupancy would probably fall dramatically and maybe they would then charge a more realistic rate.... To put it into context, based on historic reviews it was obvious to me that staying one night would be enough to enable me to tick it off my ""bucket list"" so for the rest of my time in Singapore I stayed elsewhere for half the price for a far more superior hotel experience!  It's a massive hotel so don't expect 5* service albeit the staff try hard but don't always succeed e.g. I had a reservation at Lavo which coincided with my birthday which they recognised upon entering the restaurant but failed to follow up with a gesture of a…",3,
"We went there as a couple from 2-3 october 2018.i was very unsure of the dates before. So i cancelled that booking. I was still charged a whopping 775 sgd. On inquiry, they said i made 2 bookings (WHICH WAS NOT TRUE), one of which was a no show and one i cancelled. I read about this trick on trip advisor. But i paid no heed until obviously it happened to us.  Furthermore they now said it was a duplicated booking and the money will be returned after 15 days. After they earn some interest money on our credit card that is . The view from the infinity pool and the rooms is breathtaking. The pool is always crowded. Except for maybe 7-8 am in the morning. We were honeymooners, we recieved surprise chocolates at 7 pm. Nice personalized touch!  The hotel is huge. And has a marina…",2,
"Since this hotel was built back in 2010, this tri-building with a connected top floor for swimming and events became an instant landmark tourist attraction. Many would post pictures of themselves with the bay behind them and the facade of this hotel in the background. Hotel rates are expected to be high, especially during peak seasons like holidays or during the GP (F1) weekend. Access to the pool is draconianly strict, even if you have a baby with you, he/she will have to badge with every ingress and egress to the pool area. I guess due to the popularity of the pool area, people have been trying to access it even illegally. My badge actually failed a couple of times and I was questioned on my booking details which was quite annoying. Anyway, the rooms are functional but…",4,
On arrival at the hotel everyone we met from exiting the taxi to entering our room were extremely welcoming. Our room was modern and very tastefully decorated. All of the amenities were of a high quality and we had a magnificent view over the harbour. The Skypark with its infinity pool and unforgettable view over Singapore is an experience not to be missed and the Gardens are a must see. We had a great time there and would highly recommend it,5,
"Marina Bay Sands lives up to its standards as one of the top hotels in Singapore, with the highest infinity pool in the World. The hotel itself was busy and buzzing with events and conferences, with people from all over the World. It provides various shopping opportunities and you are spoilt for choice for dining opportunities.  The facilities and amenities are top-notch with the Infinity Pool located at the 57th floor and the Banyan Tree Spa & Fitness Facilities at the 55th floor, accessible to Hotel guests. The bars & lounges also provide for a good reprieve to unwind. The Banyan Tree Fitness Gym overlooks the Marina Bay district and allows for a great workout with equipment from Technogym and Kinetika. The gym also provides a hot bath, steam room and sauna for patrons. Raj,…",5,
Simply amazing hotel !! from checkin to checkout were spotless! we booked the room which overlooked Club 55 - which was well worth it! the meals included in it were delicious! the pool is breathtaking .. do not need too much description about it !! the breakfast (in the case of those who opted for club 55) had the option of being in 4 different places .. very well served (we opted to take the Rise- which is on the 1st floor) with a multitude of foods of various places in the world !! about the room ?? it was huge and overlooking the whole city of Singapore) .. we will return to Singapore and we will stay again in this hotel for sure !!!,5,
We loved everything about this hotel and it was just what we needed after a long flight from London. The rooms were very spacious and well catered for. The bathroom nice and large with a great shower. Views from all rooms. The pool was just amazing and the reason we booked this hotel. A great place to relax and quite spectacular. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and there excellent eating choices available in all price ranges. I would definitely stay here again.,5,
"Just a fantastic hotel. Great bars, food, staff. A lovely place to spend time, The shopping mall is fantastic all the best shops in one place, a great day out even if you are only window shopping you can still have a good time",5,
"When visiting Singapore the Marina Bay Sands is always our first choice. The breathtaking architecture with the gorgeous Infinity Pool at the top is just one aspect of this spectacular venue. The service level at the Marina Bay Sands is exceptional. If you choose a room at the Club Level you are in for some special treats, highly recommended. The huge complex has direct access to the MRT system for a quick and conveniant getting around and the huge shopping center is a shoppers delight.",5,
"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon.  We landed in the morning and by the time we were at the hotel it was approx 9am.  We were greeted by the concierge who took our luggage and directed us to the check-in desk.  First impressions were wow, however, it was extremely busy.  The line for check-in was long and we waited about 45 mins before we managed to speak to someone.  We upgraded our room by the recommendation of the member of staff (who was very nice) and were given some gifts as it was our honeymoon.  The upgraded room was the premium room on the 46th floor with a balcony.  We were very happy with the room.  It was spacious and the bathroom was amazing. The decor was ok but nice enough.  In respect of the facilities there are the main things you want, but also it has the…",4,
"I booked this hotel via booking.com, and it was not very clear to me that the price quoted was sans 10% + 7%. Also do not park not enter near tower 3 ( which is the first you get to) drive on and enter at tower 1 and ‘give’ you car to the valet. Cannot believe at this price there is no free parking nor breakfast included. The buffet is 53$++ how can they justify... The room was huge, well appointed and very comfortable Family room- make sure you check- in everybody and get plenty of cards- otherwise cannot use the pool!",2,
"I guess it is a combination of spending time with two of my favourite women in the world, getting a great offer from a friend to stay at this hotel and the hotel being fab on its own. To take it to six stars we got upgraded to Club55 - feeling spoilt. ",5,
"This Hotel has it ALL, restaurants, casino, night life in the hotel and if that is not enough everything else is within walking distance or jump on the MRT (Singapore’s Transit System) which also is a very short walk. The Hotel rooms all have views of either the beautiful Gardens By The Bay or City which has a beautiful Marina with Incredible skyline. The rooms are clean and the staff go above and beyond exceptional service.  Enjoyed and will return.",5,
I was staying for two night in this hotel at tower 3. The Building was realy Great. But the room is realy nothing special for a 5 star hotel. In the.night we couldnt realy sleep becouse the noise from the car outside.we can hear all the noise from the street . The swimmingpool at the top roof was nice. Can see beautiful view all around. ,1,
"We stayed here at the end of September. An amazing 5* hotel that lives up to the hype, with the infinity pool offering stunning views, and connected to a tremendous amount of things to do around you.  We had a small cockup with booking.com, who didn’t reserve the right number of people, which meant we needed to pay more... a little shock after a long flight and at 1230am local time. But we were upgraded to a suite which was A-MAZE-ING,  had a pool table and excellent views all round. The fault was not MBS and they managed it well.  This is a BIG hotel, and from the outside can look quite brutal, but for the volume of people that go through they run a military grade operation, with very courteous staff and professionalism all round. It’s not a cheap place to stay and the pricing…",4,
"The Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is among the most famous hotel in the world thanks to its large ""beach club"" and pools located at its rooftop on the 57th floor. The Club Lounge Room was very large, modern and very comfortable. The Club Lounge was definitely the highlight of our trip and well worth the money with the breakfast buffet, the afternoon tea and the evening buffet being all of top notch quality. The rooftop pool is not to be missed thanks to breathtaking view of Singapore's skyline especially at night (of note, be prepared for the expected crowds). The MBS is directly connected to the Gardens by the Bay as well as the Singapore Metro with a very convenient access to Financial Disctrict, the Merlion and other attractions (Chinatown, Little India, Clarke Quay, etc...).

"i attended a friend's wedding the other day and was really disappointed with Singapore's Iconic MBS. Within my table, there were cups that had Lipstick Marks on them. And my dish having black stains that were removable when i gently wipe them. Furthermore after reporting, they promised to get back to me. And it has been one full month. I received no calls or anything. Service Standard of Singapore is Going down the drain. As even the Representative of Singapore's Icon is providing Such atrocious service.",1,
"The best thing about going to MBS is the fact that they open until midnight, and a lot of car park space. They have everything that you possibly need. A lot of choice for food, and perfect for night strolling and enjoying the view of Marina Bay skyline. ",5,
"Third time in Singapore, and we decided to fork out and stay our last night at Marina Bay Sands.  Price for one night in a club room After doing lots of research we decided to go for a club room, which in addition to the room also gives you a range of perks. For one night we paid around 650 sgd in total with taxes. A big price for one night, but to us it was worth it in the end.  Checking in As we arrived the Tower 1 with an Uber, we ditched the lines in the gigantic main lobby and instead entered the Sands lounge for our check in procedure. It was calm, there was free coffee, tea and water, and they made you sit down in a comfy leather chair while taking your details. We purposely arrived early (11 am) to see if we would get access to the pool or even early access to our room.…",5,
"One of the best hotels I have stayed at in the world . World class service from the airport to our suite . Exceptional staff ; caring, thoughtful , helpful and always smiling !!!!!! Made our business trip that much more amazing",5,
"The infinity pool, view of Singapore, location and amenities were great. Lots of restaurants to choose from. The room is a nice, standard hotel style.  On the downside....if traveling with kids you are surrounded by people who are obsessed by taking selfies by the pool.   If it's a hotel that's child free, I understand the culture. But people by the pool will get annoyed with children splashing around.  There was a section of the pool which was an adult only zone which people did not read about! ",4,
Amazing hotel to stay in! The staff are very friendly and the facilities are amazing! Spent most of my time at the infinity pool! Nice cocktails available and food. A bit expensive but to be expected to sinagpore! A must for any bucket list! ,5,
Nice hotel overall with the pool that is wonderful! Casino and mall connected are awesome. The rooms and bathroom are of nice size but a bit dated. The room services was prompt and well priced. The gym is well appointed but the changes rooms are a bit small. Sauna and Spa are also small for the size of property and number of people attempting to use the facility when i was.,4,
"We stayed at the marina bay for one night during our honeymoon. We paid for an upgrade so we were on a higher floor with a much better view of the marina. The rooms were lovely and clean with a great shower. We ate in the italian restaurant on the top floor called lavo. We had a mixed experience, some staff seemed nonchalant whereas others were more than happy to help and the food was good. We had breakfast in the al la carte restaurant on the ground floor which had an amazing selection available. We spent time in the infinity pool which was amazing. It was very busy though and not somewhere you’d go to relax! The hotel was very pricey but we had budgeted for this as part of our honeymoon experience.",4,
"And what a stop! If you can afford it, do it, simple as. Yes it’s a tourist attraction and yes it’s massive as a hotel but you’ve stayed in one of the worlds most iconic hotels with the most amazing roof top pool.   I read loads of the negative reviews, more for comedy value as the Marina Bay Sands is an experience, not good or bad, just an immersive experience.",5,
"Had an incredible stay with Marina Bay Sands, love the infinity pool and a sip of the sling.  Don’t forgot to go tie the rooftop for the great view of Singapore.  Room is a bit expensive but you got what you paid for, worst spending time and money here ",5,
"Stunning hotel, and of course the rooftop infinity pool. Beautiful views from the pool out over the city of Singapore especially at night. Rooms where spacious, and luxurious. Right in the heart of all the action, great place to stay",5,
"After a long flight it was great to arrive at a hotel with smooth and quick check in. We opted for a city view double room, which was spacious along with a huge bed and blackout blinds, helpful for the jet lag!   The infinity pool can only be accessed by hotel guests but at night it is packed and hard to find room to enjoy the Singapore skyline, luckily we could see it from our room. However, at 6am we had a whole section of the pool to ourselves to watch the sun come up, worth the early start and made our stay worthwhile, we would recommend a stay just for this.   We also made use of the Rise restaurant breakfast which had a huge variety of food, both asian and western hot food along with pastries, fruit, cereal etc, and as Singapore prices go was worth the $45 per person.",4,
"If in Singapore, stop by and tour this unusual hotel.  Heard the rooms are not worth the rates, but experience the view - buy a ticket.",5,
"We had an amazing stay in an enormous family room with an incredible patio balcony overlooking Gardens by The Bay. Huge hotel, infinity pool is amazing & a must see. This was a wonderful treat from our Son & his partner for us all while staying in Singapore & it was an unforgettable experience.",5,
Best in terms of everything. Great hospitality Supportive staff Best quality rooms Amazing infinity pool Huge casino Had best Indian food at Punjab grill Easy access to garden by the bay and cloud forest Nd overall best fun experience If you plan a trip to Singapore must visit this place. ,5,
My partner and I went to the F1 in sept .  We went up the lifts to the bar area to get a drink and ended up in the dinner queue .  It was difficult to communicate what we wanted to do .  In the end they sent us down stairs to buy a ticket for the viewing deck .  This was amazing the views were breath taking .  We found out the next day you can pay £20 use the ticket to go into the bar area and get a drink .  I’m disappointed this wasn’t made clearer as that’s exactly what we would have done . ,3,
"I was only staying here for 2 days but got myself a city view suite and i have to say it was well worth it.  Firstly , the hotel itself is huge and has access to the shopping mall through an underground tunnel.   The Gardens by the bay are just behind it and are a must to see the show in the evening.   The rooftop pool is fantastic and so unusual and wasnt too crowded when we were there.  Staff in the hotel are really good and friendly and helpful and its one thing that i really appreciated while travelling.  The breakfast consisted of a vast selection of various types of food covering almost all ethnicity.   I'd definitely go again.",5,
"It was every thing perfect! The Pool, the hospitality! We enjoyed every day in Marina Bay Sands! The hotel was wonderfull, the pool and room rervices too. I want to come back to Singapor and Marina Bay too ",5,
My daughter and I had High Tea at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It was one of the best we have had . Not only do you get a tea master to marry up the perfect tea for what you are eating but the food is unlimited. The food was amazing and exceptional. The staff were wonderful and very according . A must if you love High Tea like we do.,5,
"While in Singapore, stay only in marina if yiu want to enjoy Singapore. For a complete 360 view of singapore, this is the only place, Swimming pool, infinity pool, on roof top is a achitectural marvel. The restuarant, the jaccuzi, febulous.",5,
"My 2nd time staying here, but this time it is more memorable. i decided since we stayed here for three nights, i should explore the whole aspects of this hotel. What I love about this place is the facilities MBS has to offer. My first time walking the bridge that connects to Gardens by the Bay and enjoying the view from top to see the lobby and facade of the hotels. What lacks the most from this place is a big supermarket, a movie place and bowling alley for non gamblers.",4,
"Expensive but worth the money from the minute you step outside your arriving taxi to the minute you step back in the taxi on departure.  Our suitcases were unloaded from the taxi, we were given a card to present at check in and luggage was whisked away and in our room on arrival.  Check in was very quick all in all about 5 minutes (including queueing). We were given our room key and told about everything we needed to know for our stay.  We were shown to our room and the attendant told us everything we needed to know about operating lights, curtains, air con etc.  We had a premiere room on the 37th floor overlooking the Bay Gardens (as requested). The view was magnificent and we watched the super tree light display from our balcony.  The room was of a really good size, light and…",5,
"My family and I (2A, 2K, 8 & 10yo) stayed at Marina Bay Sands on a stopover from Melbourne to Thailand. After staying at the Marriott Khao Lak innThailand (comfy couch to sit on, welcome drink, personalised service), check in here was a rude shock. Hardly anywhere to sit (some fancy thing in the lobby that you can only sit on part of and a security guard watches over the rest!!), a massive queue to check in and our room was not ready. When we got to the room it was just ok - looks dated and a previous guest has clearly been smoking in the toilet. Access cards didn’t work where they were supposed to and I was underwhelmed with the whole place, especially for the exorbitant price. But I guess we stayed there as it is such an iconic building. The Skypark is fabulous fun and the…",3,
"I recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands over the Formula 1 weekend and several extra nights(9 in total) to look around Singapore. The room I had was a Premier Twin Garden View Room on the 20th Floor in Tower 2. The room was spacious, clean. and well fitted out. The service from check-in to check-out was friendly and efficient by every member of staff in all departments including concierge, restaurants and gift shop. I tried breakfast in Rise Restaurant one day but found it a bit impersonal due to its size. I opted for Spago on the roof of the hotel which I had tried the previous day which had a more cosy and personal feel and also the view. Most evenings I went to Spago as it was a Lounge and Bar. Spago had a fabulous atmosphere, great music, plenty of drinks choice and very…",5,
"visited the Marina Bay sands to enjoy the mall and Casino. The casino is huge and there is lots of action either on the slots or the tables. I would highly recommend the Casino and if you are a visitor to Singapore, don't forget your passport as you will need it for entry.  ",5,
"What can I say that hasnt been said about this hotel, its simply amazing. The rooms, the staff, the amenities, everything is what a 5 star hotel should be. Everytime I visit this place its always amazing, and all the amenities and everything is great but no matter how many times I take a dip in the swimming pool on the top, everytime its breath taking.",5,
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for two days. I was able to book a room with a good view with the kind help of a person named Wangelin Sum. The hotel's view was fantastic and the pool was also great. Thanks to you, I made good memories.",5,
"Had a suite here as a birthday present last year and have never stayed anywhere quite like this in my life. The infinity pool on the roof was incredible and as you'd expect for a hotel at this price, staff & amenities impeccable. Will 100% go again.",5,
* Good to visit at twilight  * Amazing view of skyline  * Laser show with themed music in the fountain is worth waiting for * The ferry ride - Singapore by night - is a memorable experience  * Getting off at Clarke quay and taking in the food options available is a wonderful feeling  ,5,
"I could have given another extra star for the marvel of property and the location, truly phenomenal.  I was here for he Formula One weekend and stayed at tower 2. Hotel was busy so the check in took us time albeit we had booked a night before so we could checkin in the morning. The front desk team were just as courteous as they should be, what really impressed me was the house keeping, room service team who were all so quick to attend to when needed. Eg, on arrival I realised the hair dryer wasn't working and I was a little reluctant to call for it thinking they make take time as the check in was long, to my surprise the replacement came immediately, I loved it.  We did dine around the restaurants and bars in the hotel, I would say it was a mix of good and not so good…",4,
"I didn't t stay at this hotel during my trip to Singapore, but i did visit , after my visit i wish i would have stayed there, The level of attention form the minute you entered till the time you left was spot on. It didn't matter if I stayed there or not, I still received a fantastic level of service form all he hotel staff that I came in contact with. The place is very big and of course a bit confusing, but there were enough staff on hand to direct, ask and smile me to my destination. Much thanks for the warm treatment, I will defiantly choose there to stay on my best trip.",4,
"We recently stayed for 7 nights in Singapore and we spent our final night at Marina Bay Sands hotel. We are a family of 5, two adults and three children and so I booked two adjoining non-smoking rooms for one night. This was a surprise for our children and it turned out to be a huge surprise for us too, as we were upgraded to a suite!  We arrived at the hotel and I liked the way they have various staff in the foyer to greet people and direct you. It's such a popular destination that it's great that someone speaks to you personally and directs you to the correct places.  We queued for a few minutes and then we were helped by a lovely lady- I'm sorry to say that I can't quite recall her name but I believe it was Ai Lee or similar (apologies for not recording this accurately). She…",5,
My colleague and here stayed here for one night after our conference at MBS. It was everything we could imagine and more! The breakfast at Adrift was amazing with a large variety. The infinity pool is beautiful and I loved the fact there was an adult only section. I wish there were more jacuzzis though.,5,
"I stayed here with my wife for 1 night in September 2018. I booked a Queen room originally.  Check in was from 3pm, but we arrived at 1pm, and went to the Sands Lounge, where we took a ticket and drank free tea/coffee until our number was called. The check in clerk offered me an upgrade, and I took it.  It was worth every penny when my wife opened the door to suite 2406.  The suite had two rooms, bay views from both rooms, huge bed and bathroom, as well as a dressing room. In room there was a nespresso machine, kettle and tea / coffee. The staff were helpful and pleasant, snd even though my birthday was 9 days away, they noted the date from my check-in information and sent birthday cake to my room!! The skypark was a nice place to relax and people-watch, although drinks are…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is the most luxurious hotel of Singapore, I believe. But every penny that you spend for it is worth. It's so so so beautiful.   Super famous for it's infinity pool, no doubt you'll have infinite memories of the infinity pool 🤩   POINTS TO NOTE-   1. No mandatory swimming costume in the pool. You can chill in our swimwear or in anything you're comfortable with.  The pool is open from 7am to 11pm.  Chilling in the pool in the evening , watching the skyhigh buildings and the citylights  is a visual treat.  They have drinks by the pool.  And complimentary towels. Also, there are 3 to 4 Jacuzzi.  2. There is an observation deck on 57th floor from where you get the view of Singapore. It's free when you stay in the hotel. Also, you can skip the Singapore flyer if…",5,
"We stayed here on our way to Thailand for 1 night. This hotel is stunning! It’s one of the iconic hotels of the world, a must see for everyone. Right in the heart of it all, shopping, restaurants, gardens by the bay, marina the list goes on. The rooms are massive with big bathrooms. We had a view of the gardens by the bay which are beautiful. There’s so much to see and do here! Only one thing we wasn’t to happy about, that was the beds. Ours was rather hard and not very comfy. But other then that what a hotel! ",4,
"This is hotel is far from being a luxury one and feels more like a classic tourist trap. Off course the building where it is, is one of the most incredible  buildings of the world, great location, etc, etc... But from a hospitality perspective this hotel fails big time. Summary below: 1) It is overcrowded....you need to queue for the breakfast, for the checking, for the lift, etc.... 2) It is 0 classy, it resembles more to a Carnival cruise experience rather than to a luxury exclusive resort. 3) The pool is incredible, but good luck finding a bed, none cleans and takes the towels so its a mess, good luck finding a waitress to take your order, etc... 4) I arrive to my room and the carpet was wet in multiple spots, kind of disgusting, they didnt care on apologizing, and send just…",3,
"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was truly magical. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels around the world before, but MBS was by far the best.  We stayed in a Premium room, in the middle tower, with a beautiful views of the Gardens by the Bay, Domes and Super Trees.   We arrived in Singapore with 3 hours delay, around 9pm and the reception, at that time, was very quiet and our check in went quickly and smoothly. The receptionist was very nice and gave us all the necessary information, so we did not feel lost in this huge complex. After refreshing, in our beautiful bathroom, we went across to the Shoppes, and had a dinner at one of many restaurants.   In the morning our first stop was, of course,  the famous Infinity Pool. It was truly magnificent. As it was still early and rather…",5,
So this a review from someone who normally stays in simple accommodation but for our silver wedding anniversary we splashed out on 2 nights at MBS - best decision we made. We checked in early and our room was ready - a deluxe room on 25th floor of tower 3 with a magnificent view over the gardens at the bay.  We of course got changed and headed straight up to the infinity pool which was as amazing as all the pictures portray. We were fascinated by the extreme measures taken for the perfect pose. We decided to treat ourselves to in room dining as we had such a magnificent view from our balcony. We had prawn and mango salad and smoked duck starter- both tasted fabulous and really big portions. For main we had fillet steak and rack of lamb again cooked to perfection. We had our meal…,5,
"You are looking for sensation. You are looking for Comfort. You want to have the one time life experience. If yes, spend at least one night at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I have stayed recently for 4 nights and have stayed before 1 night and every time it is magic. The design of the place is unbelievable. The view from the rooms is mind blowing. The facilities from the extra donate infinity pool until the shopping mall are amazing. It is just missing a bit of soul to make it as a perfection. Thank ou for the great stay.",4,
Checking in was pretty quick and hassle free on this occasion. We were offered a room on the 17th floor of Tower 1 with a city view. The room was spacious and well lit. Liked the firm mattress and pillows provided. These really helped in ensuring a good night's sleep. The view from the room was awesome. We could see the city skyline and some of the other iconic structures clearly from the room. Really enjoyed this recent staycation.,4,
"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location close to parks, restaurants and high end shopping.  It is a very large hotel with some 2000 rooms and so breakfast is served in any one of 4 restaurant on the property but the pick for me was the roof top restaurant with magnificent views of Singapore.  Whilst on breakfast, it was a full buffet with the addition of custom made eggs by the chefs on hand.  A good variety of fruits, cereal, juices as well as Asian and Western breakfast offerings. For such a large hotel the service was superb but a quick note, if you plan on staying in a club room be aware that the size of the club room is a little disproportionate to the size of the hotel so you need to be there early to get a seat or wait until a table is ready. That said, the food and…",5,
"My (now) fiancé and I stayed here in July 2018. We had planned to stay in a different hotel but he was planning to propose in the Gardens by the Bay and splurged for us to spend a single night at the famous Marina Bay Sands. This hotel is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at in my life and the experience was truly magical.  After waiting in line to check in for about 30 minutes, our room was ready ahead of schedule and was immaculately clean and huge. We had a city view room on the 42nd floor. Our belongings were taken up to our room promptly and we left to explore the property and take a swim in the amazing infinity pool.  The pool is exactly how you imagine it - it is clean and cool and packed with people but the view and the experience is amazing. Our pictures may be…",5,
"This hotel is great for first time travelling to Singapore, because it is close to all the attractions in the Marina Bay area, which include Garden By the Bay (+ Evening light show; it is so close you can come twice to see the garden during night time and day time, which both were great experiences), SkyPark look out deck (already in the hotel ), Merlion (within 20 minutes walk), Singapore Flyer, Casino (connected to the hotel), theaters on the Bay (under 10 minutes), Wonder Full light show, etc.     If you are a first timer or have a short stay in Singapore, you may also want to eat or shop the stores unique to Singapore, and the shopping mall connecting the Marina Bay Sands has it all.   Marina Bay Sands feels very much like a Vegas hotel, the grandiose design with connecting…",4,
"Huge modern hotel with the famous pool on top. My room was premier size. Large light, and airy. Spectacular view of Gardens by the bay and the harbour and I saw the city from the pool. I spent hours at the pool, reading and people watching. Service was good. The service to my room was great. The bathroom was fabulous, but the bath was plastic. Design was excellent. On the hand I constantly felt I was being ripped off. The breakfast was outrageous for what was on offer. They checked my fridge constantly to see if things had been used. I drank at the bars on the 57 floor! They charged for valet service like I have never seen before. The ground floor was constantly full of tourists rather than guests. They ran of newspapers at breakfast. I went out on adventures but it was nice to…",4,
"Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an architectural wonder. The hotel inside from rooms, view, service and location is simply the best. I had a weekend stay during the Singapore Grand Prix and the hotel was a highlight of the weekend.   My room was a city view from a high floor. The room itself was spacious and with a very good layout. Breakfast was included in  my room. Beware there is a long line for the breakfast but it's quick not more than 10 minutes. There is a wide array of food from Asia to Western cusine. Restaurant staff working there will go beyond in customer service. Also all staff were friendly at all parts of the hotel. The bars and restaurants were also a great place to have a meal and drink.  I would recommend this as a place to stay when you are visiting Singapore.",5,
"My sister & I stayed at MBS for New Years- so three nights in total. As a travel agent; I had heard a lot of mixed things about the property. Arriving at the property I was shocked to see the amount of people here. It felt like you were in a shopping centre. Check in took about half an hour. Our room was on level 20- with gardens by the bay views..stunning at night! There are three restaurants where you can go for breakfast- must try them all! I spent an entire day lazing around by the infinity pool. You get views of the entire city. I spent New Years up at the pool. Although it was pouring, it was the best one I’ve ever had. Definitely worth splurging! ",5,
"Spent 3 nights as a present to myself turning sixty. Room on 47th floor was beautifulwith amazing views of garden and harbour but offered long life milk. So requested a glass of fresh milk for my morning cuppa. 10 dollars. Couldnt access room fridge without putting money on it but didnt want to use minibar, just wanted to keep milk and bottled water cold. Had to hire a second bar fridge for 10 dollars. Went up to roof top bar at sunset. One glass of house white cost 33 dollars. Wised up after that and ate elsewhere and bought bottled wine in supermarkets.

Nothing more. 2 star hotels offer a room fridge and free…",3,
The very aura of marina bay sand fills you with joy. The seaside view and food vendors make it the best place to stay and hangout. It is the main attraction of Singapore if you ask me. I would totally recommend staying there.,5,
"We stayed for one night before flying back home from a fantastic holiday. This hotel is out of this world. The staff are so friendly and helpful and as we booked a club room we had to check in at the Sands Lounge which was effortless. We were checked in by a lovely lady who was friendly and interested in our holiday and travels.   Our room was amazing, we were upgraded to a city view and it was a great view from our room. There was everything we needed and wanted. The one complaint I would have if I am being picky is the bath towels were quite small and rough feeling.   The infinity pool speaks for itself. The water was warm, we went up before sunset and stayed until it was dark to see the city come alive. I have heard that weekends are particularly busy, but as it was a weekday…",5,
"We decided to stay here for 4 days on our anniversary before flying off to Bali. What a fantastic hotel, with the best views in singapore. Not the cheapest but for a great experience and a special treat, what a way to live.  We had a huge room that looked over the marina from the 37th floor, with  Floor to ceiling curved windows, great view of the marina and city. And at night a view of the light and water show projected onto the marina. We arrived early at 7am from London. The reception staff told us that they would try and get us a room earlier than three pm. True to their word, they called and we had a room by 11.am. It is a monster hotel with casino, shopping center, connected to the living garden and underground station. The infinity pool on the 57th floor roof was out of…",5,
one of the best hotels of the world it is a life experience an architectonik wonder inside and outside three separate buildings joined on the top with a huge rooftop on the rooftop there are restaurants gardens with trees waters and of course the infinity pool only for the residents you MUST swimm in this pool with the breathtaken view the lobby is fantastic the rooms are huge and nice in the evening they have a light show inside the sea unique the staff is like a very good mashine everybody knows very well what to do yes you have to go there,5,
"This truly is a jaw dropping hotel with the most amazing views, We have just returned to the uk after been in Singapore for 10 days to take in the F1 and we wasn't disappointed. The hotel staff and Singaporeans in general are the kindest friendliest people i have ever encountered, Nothing is too much trouble. Even the locals are amazing, If you look lost they approach you to ask if you need help. We were slightly confused while using the MRT underground transport system and got on the wrong train, When I asked a passenger if i was on the correct train he said no come with me I will show you which one you need, He stepped off and missed his train to show us the right way, We couldn't believe it can you imagine that happening in London.

So lets start from the beginning, i have a broken foot and currently i have to wear a air cast. We arrive at reception to check into our Suite, well we queued for 40 mins mins before someone noticed that i had a broken foot, and ushered us to another area to be checked it. The queues at check in are very bad. It was only on my departure i was told that as i had booked a suite i could have checked in at the Sands Lounge ! The suite was amazing, very high quality to go along with the high price. The roof top pool was interesting, I appreciated it as the weekend but it felt like half of Singapore was in the pool. And why is…",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is a massive project with 3 towers to begin with and has a convention center, casino, a theatre plus huge number of shops all connected together.  Its highlight is the infinity pool on the top floor that offers a majestic view of the Singapore skyline.  The rooms are quite roomy and modern so you either get a city or a garden view (Garden by the Bay).  Probably its because we stayed on a weekend which explains the pool is filled with so many hotel guests that it just feels crowded.  The lobby was likewise filled with people considering the huge floor area  the lobby covers which makes us wonder if the price per night the hotel charges is actually worth it or not.  It just doesn't give you that luxury or exclusive feel to an expensive hotel.",4,
"We loved this hotel! Arriving from Europe after a long haul flight this hotel was an amazing antidote  for jetlag.We arrived at 9am and were able to check into our room immediately. Staff are extremely efficient and accommodating.  We had  a Premier Room which was spacious,luxurious  and ever so comfortable. Great view of the gardens (and lightshow) and the bay. The rooftop pool is an amazing and relaxing experience.",5,
"The building is very beautiful and surprisingly. The room is very beautiful, very big and very modern. The views from the room was amazing, and the experience of being in the highest swimming pool of the world is impressive. See the sunset and how the buildings are being illuminating is very beautiful. The swimming pool is very large and there are some zones. Also, on the top there are some restaurants. The hotel is very well connected with underground, there are a lot of shops. If you go to Singapore, you have to stay at that hotel. We never forget this experience. I recommend you. ",5,
Visited the Skypark in the day and at night. Night time was amazing and not to be missed. Incredible.,5,
Breath taking hotel!!! From arrival with amazing staff despite it being a huge property to the rooms with magnificent view of the Bay and personal attention by the staff!!! Restaurants and bars are multiple and very good from Ce la vie on the roof top to the lobby bar!!!! The infinity pool on the roof is an experience that cants be missed!!!!! ,5,
"This is definitely a unique place, the largest real estate investment ever, an ambitious architecture, THE Singapore landmark. My Deluxe room was really nice, very spacious and confortable. As I was in medium floor (26/F) my balcony was nice, with view on the garden. Amazing sunset !  However what I dislike is the massive scale of this hotel in terms of number of rooms and customers.... indeed it's more exhausting than relaxing giving the long distances to walk through, the queues, the crowd.  Fortunately the staff is kind and really nice. I recommend just as a one-off experience.",4,
I had stayed here for 1 night because it’s located near Marina Bay Cruise. A room is clean and hygiene. A view from my room is Garden by the bays so I can see the night show in my private zone !!! And swimming pool locate on rooftop and look like infinity pool!! ,4,
"Well, I'm still in two minds about it. I mean yes, the pool with that view is amazing. The building is amazing. But, the poolside is crowded. Nowhere to put your things if all the loungers are taken. Too many vain people taking selfies (a couple of pics is acceptable but more than this becomes annoying).  Showers in the rooms are pathetic.  The view from my room was amazing and the bed was comfy.  The check-in was sooo slow. Please do something about that.  Long long walk to the food court. In all, would I stay there again? Yes probably. Not perfect but overall I enjoyed it. ",4,
"The hotel is iconic and you can't help but want to take pictures of it from every angle. But it is big and busy and not very welcoming. The room was big and beautiful, balcony huge with a view over the gardens by the bay. Location is great. Infinity pool looks dirty brown rather than bright blue, is busy and full of posers taking selfies with the view. And actually the view is quite bland as you are on the most iconic building in the skyline. We stayed at The Face Suites in Kuala Lumpur on the same holiday and much preferred the pool there and it was a fraction of the price! Glad we've stayed there but wouldn't go back. It's too expensive for what you get and if you want a pool holiday I'd go elsewhere!",4,
"This hotel is very big very crowdy anf much to expensive for what you get,.We stayed in a beautiful room with great views but the drain in the shower was broken and the infinity pool was very very dirty.also the stuff is not friendly and not very helpfuland we had to wait long time to check in and check out",3,
"I booked this hotel for 1 Night - Honeymoon.  Upon arrival our luggage was taken from us and we went to the queto check-in. This took forever and there was only 4/5 people infant of us. This could have been a lot more better for a world class hotel which charges a lot of money per room. Was expecting better.  The skypark was amazing - great views of the gardens and city skyline. We had breakfast at the hotel the next day. Breakfast was great! loads of foods of choose from.  We didn't get a chance to visit the infinity pool - it was mega busy so if your looking for a quiet hotel, do not come here. If you want the tourist feeling of buzzing - highly recommended.   I book the city skyline view. it was impressive. the room was clean and tidy - very spacious. We had a nice honeymoon…",4,
We had been to Marina Bay Sands hotel Singapore for a conference. The stay was for just 2 nights but had a great time. Excellent view of complete Singapore city from the terrace. The infinity pool was simply great. Its amazingly made architecture. Growing trees on 70th floor itself is a wonder.,5,
"Stayed here for the F1 and The following week for sight seeing. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. We landed at Singapore at 05:30 local time after a 13 hour flight. We arrived at the hotel by 07:00, tired but looking to leave our luggage whilst we looked around waiting for check-in at.15:00. Instead the staff checked the available rooms found one already available and checked us in there and then. Meant we could have a couple of hours sleep, freshen up and then have the rest of the day exploring the beautiful gardens around the hotel  As mentioned in the title, the hotel is iconic. The infinity pool on the top floor is a lot of fun, and the views are amazing, plus where else can you swim out doors on the 57th floor  in a thunder storm looking down on the whole of Singapore.…",4,
"We have just had a trip of a lifetime at the Marina Bay Sands, service was impeccable, staff friendly and helpful. Views from our suite were stupendous. Walked into tower one and it was fabulous. We were taken up to the suite to check in and they came to the suite to check us out, certainly the way to go. Beautiful place to stay and highly recommend it. When it's lit up at night, has to been seen to be believed! We pushed the boat out and had a two bedroom suite for our family, quite expensive but it was a once in a life time experience. The view over the bay was magical, the infinity pool was a lot busier than expected but still a great place to watch the sun go down. If only I'd remembered the Grand Prix I'd have booked it for later in the year but didn't. Which was my only…",5,
Its such a wonderful view of Singapore town at night i.e good views as you walk along the street. There is plenty of eateries and art museum. The Formula one Singapore Grand Prix track is visible and attracts one of the largest crowds.,5,
"Stayed here for 1 night, rave night of the F1 as a treat.  Walked in to Tower 1 and was blown away.  As beautiful inside as it is outside.  No queue at check in so was spoken to by a very friendly member of staff who seemed interested in why we were in Singapore.  “Would you like a free upgrade to a city view room Sir?”  Eh let me think about that. On race weekend, yes please!!  Floor 32 with a view over the city.  Well worth the price I paid.  The room was perfect.  Plenty of room with a floor to ceiling window and a couple of chairs in front of it to watch the world go by.  The bathroom was just amazing.  Massive bath, seperate shower wet room and another similar room for the toilet.  Bed was super comfy and probably the best night sleep I have ever had in a hotel.  Then comes…",5,
"I stayed at MBS a few years ago and loved it, we were upgraded to a suite as we stayed on a Monday night which was a treat and the hotel is so big it has that real wow factor when you walk in.  Sadly, it felt that this time around the size of the hotel is what was bringing it down. It's now so big and knows it will always have clients due to its famous infinity pool that it doesn't bother too much with that 'above and beyond' service you would expect from such a famous (and non-cheap) hotel.  MBS has a lot of mixed reviews for a reason...  Check in was ghastly, it took over 45 minutes and was eating into our pool time which was not cool. There was a big challenge over rooms as my friend was also staying and we were wanting to be on the same floor, long story short I paid more…",3,
"Our journey started with a pre-arranged transport from Changi airport . We been to Singapore before but this time with our two teenage children. On arrival at the hotel we were whisked off straight to our rooms and a superb in-room checkin not taking longer than a few minutes was arranged by two very nice staff. The hotel had upgraded us and we enjoyed fantastic views from the club floor. Absolutely amazing. Visit to the pool, dinner in Spago, drinks in Ce La Vi , every place we went to was amazing. Breakfast was a special delight. Great variety and service Whow. One staff went out of her way to make our stay sensationally fun, Ms Erin from Concierge. She really knows how to organise, delegate and get things done. Kudos to her bosses to have selected such a great staff. We will…",5,
We went to the Marina Bay Sands for the view only we didn't stay. The most cost effective way to get to the top is to buy a ticket to the top floor bar. They are $SD20 each BUT include the cost towards some refreshments. Sure you can just pay the same amount to go to the viewing platform (which is one floor below) but you only get the admission. The bar area at least allows you to linger over a drink at a table (inside or out) and take in the view of Singapore and the rooftop infinity pool. These tickets are available from the LOBBY level and not lower ground floor). The views are extensive and by going to various points around the level you can get near 360 degrees views around this location.It is also quite disabled friendly as well (including disabled toilets).

"It’s expensive but really worth it. This hotel has smoking rooms and smoking areas. It is directly connected to its own shopping mall; has a skyview of almost all of the island; and, has a 100 meter swimming pool at the roofdeck 57th floor. A truly great experience!",5,
"This is an incredible motel that was very high up on our bucket list. The building, the view, the pool and the sky deck are all incredible. However, the service is atrocious. It is extremely expense for food and drinks yet this is not matched with high quality, high class service.  Right from a poor check in experience through to a poor checkout experience we were frustrated by poor communication, a lack of care or even low quality customer service.  We discovered that despite staying for 3 nights you only receive free wifi for 24 hours. Even the cheapest motels offer free wifi now. To get free wifi after this you need to sign up to the rewards program. This was not explained at check in and the log in screen is very confusing. To join the rewards program you join a queue for an…",2,
"It is definitely a must stay hotel in Singapore since it has outstanding views and an amazing swimming pool.  Hotel is huge but sadly reception was not informative enough to let us know the places we should visit upon check-in since they are based in the hotel itself. Being unaware, we were not able to visit the sky view at the hotel since we needed to check out and only find out then. They did not allow us to go back upstairs which was a pity that ruins the experience.  Overall the rooms were very clean had a good size. The swimming pool was amazing but it was almost so difficult to make an order or to receive food too.  I probably won't visit again, but it was once a lifetime experience and I ticked it !. Thank you Marina Bay Sands.",3,
" It has been decades since I have been treated so badly by hotel staff. I turned up at the fitness center ready to use a treadmill. And I was turned away because I didn’t meet their “strict dress code”.  The woman at the counter questioned whether my pants were sufficiently athletic. I was told that my long sleeve shirt was not allowed. And I was barred from entry. The gym was completely typical, except for its view, and it was really quite humiliating, unnecessary and a waste of my time.  If you’re interested, you can check out my inappropriate shirt in the picture.  For me this hotel was a poor value and a bad experience.  I’ll add the good: at about usd 650/night, my 42nd floor premium room had a great view. And the pool on the 57th floor rooftop was even better.  The room…",2,
The overall experience is great. We had met friendly staffs and approachable room attendants. They are very welcoming and pleasant. The infinity pool is quite crowded but it is the best part of our stay.,5,
This is an iconic hotel that commands the status it seems to be asking for in the Singapore skyline.   We booked an upgrade and got a city view room with access to the Club 55 which meant we had afternoon tea and then canapés and drinks between 5pm and 7pm. This upgrade was well worth it as it meant you could dine slightly more exclusively with amazing views of the city or Bay Gardens. The food was simply perfect and was so plentiful it meant that the two days we were there we didn’t need to eat anywhere else.   The only real down side is that hotel Is so big it made the lobby area really busy with tourists and guests but that said the staff are so efficient that check in and check out was really quick.   Be careful as this was the first stop on our honeymoon in the region and…,5,
had to stay 2 nights for business since it is closest to expo in mbs. i arrived 10am and was dropped off by grab in the third tower. i checked in and was greeted by the warm staff and was efficiently sent on my way up. i got a room on the 25th floor of tower 3 and immediately saw the space of the room. the toilet was complete with toiletries and had a luxurious feel. i was hoping that it had a tub and some rainfall type shower but it was functional nonetheless. the bed was equipped with soft pillows and clean sheets that made my sleep great. i particularly liked the balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay. had breakfast at rise and was really happy with the selection. i guess it is hard to have such a great image that sometimes you get compared to that all the time. the hotel…,4,
"Iconic hotel with shopping mall attached right at the front of the bay.  We went for the Grand Prix and a few extra nights and were delighted with this fantastic place.  The alternative food outlets had everything we needed and we didn't need to repeat any venue - though understand that they are expensive.  Our room was great, the staff were helpful, the place feels special, the views are amazing.  Our only complaint: the pool area was a big disappointment - far too crowded with a lot of people just standing in the pool eating and drinking. Poor guest behaviour (could be better managed) but frankly the pools are too small for the size of the hotel when it is full.",5,
"We stayed three nights, and everything went without a hitch.  The room was big, and had a nice balcony and gorgeous bay view of the Singapore Gardens and Ships off shore.  The facilities are very nice, yet it’s a vibrant massive hotel with a Vegas or cruise atmosphere that my wife and I don’t prefer, so we did not use the famous infinity pool on top.  The food at breakfast was great and very varied, room service was outstanding and the fridge for Sin$10 for the whole stay was a classy touch.  The ladies who clean the rooms are always around to give you an extra bar of soap with a smile, Xiao Li seemed like the boss of our floor and although she was Chinese her English was much better than the concierge’s at another luxurious hotel we have stayed recently.  Xiao’s attitude was…",5,
Marina Bay Sands is an expensive property. But if you want absolute luxury you have to pay for it. And it is worth every penny. I would rank it as one of the best hotels in Asia if not the world. Its an experience worth paying 300-400 USD a night even for the basic rooms. Sunrise at the infinity pool when its next to empty more than makes up for what you pay for the room. Everything else is a bonus.  Check In - The smoothest experience I have had in any hotel across the globe. Standard check in time is 3 pm. We reached there around 1. There was a small queue and staff was serving juice to those waiting in line. We expected to be made to wait till the check in time. But even before we said anything the lady at the reception gave us our room keys and said we can't make you when…,5,
"Stayed many times at MBS, mostly for quick getaway, and surprisingly their service is consistently good. Had a bit of problem with the bathroom but got fixed within 15 minutes. The hotel is super crowded as usual.",5,
"Stayed here for 5 nights for the formula 1. Stayed in a deluxe city view room on level 40. Yeh the view is nice , but for the price we paid we did expect a lot more. The shower is big but the shower head and pressure was terrible. The lifts are hot and uncomfortable. The bed is not very comfortable. Seemed to be very tight with the amenities that were sometimes not replenished. It is handy to stay there as trains are close but would definitely stay somewhere else if we ever return for the Grand Prix.",3,
"We booked a night at the MBS, purely because, as everyone does, we wanted to experience this ultra modern and new hotel with infinity pool.    I'd just like to say that if you have the time to read the 25,000+ reviews then that is great, however we all know we are booking the hotel for the pool.  The pool offers some very pretty photo opportunities, but I cannot understand why anyone would want to spend a day at this pool.  I lasted 20 minutes.  The water was luke warm (yuck!) and full of dead skin which you can see floating in the water when the pool is lit up at night.  It is full of selfish and quite frankly annoying tourists absolutely DESPERATE to take that perfect selfie.  Don't get me wrong, I took a few pics, but I tried to be respectful to the people around me.  Anyway,…",4,
"A hotel with a bit of class.  Wanted something a little special for our last couple of days in this beautiful city and that’s exactly what we got.  Beautiful room overlooking a beautiful garden view. Had a relaxing time by the infinity pool and a cool off in the pool and enjoyed a couple of cold drinks. Great buffet breakfast this morning, not included and a little pricey but worth it.",5,
"This hotel really only survives because of the spectacular pool and rooftop. I can't imagine why anyone would stay here otherwise.  The rooms are basic and over-priced. The location is okay, but not great, The ground floor area and lobby is a concrete monstrosity.  Now I have stayed here and enjoyed the pool and roof, there is no way I would stay again - there are much nicer hotels in Singapore.",3,
"A place to sit and relax after your long day. Very pleasant, absolutely clean and good place for taking photos . I recommend this place must visit in Singapore. A place where the upperclassman shop and stay.",5,
Hotel was absolutely beautiful and extremely impressive as far as design and architecture goes. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. If you have a chance check out the infinity pool on top of the hotel. ,5,
"Stayed for 1 night during business trip.  Pluses: - it is just amazing place to be - incredible architecture and structure; - beautiful day and night view from infinity pool; - nice gym; - spacious well equipped rooms; - nice view on Marina and Gardens (have opposite option - but i like night Gardens view with light show); - super convenient around - shopping mall, convention and exhibition center, casino, concert hall and etc; - good breakfast with good selection.  Minuses: - it is just so many people.......  - check-in was long. Have to be optimized; - pool is a bit messy with so many people there day and night; - in general does not worth it i would say.  - very loud in Gardens direction. Sound protection is not best.   In general - maybe for special occasion worth it. But…",3,
Excellent restaurant and excellent friendly staff. Especially Celine who was the number 1 employee!  The cover changes was 48$ but normally it is less and the view is worth every penny. Also you get a free drink with that so if you have a Baileys you probably break even,5,
"This hotel is really something. It is absolutely huge. We stayed here for one night so that we could enjoy the views from the top and of course the iconic pool.  We arrived at around 10am which meant check in was really quick and easy. Our room wasn’t ready but we were given temporary keys so that we could explore the hotel before our room number was allocated. This then meant we could quickly have the keys updated later on with our having to wait in the long check in queues.  The hotel is in a great location with minutes walk to the MRT and gardens by the bay. The shopping mall is well worth a visit even if you aren’t planning on shopping.   The room was large, clean and very comfortable with a fantastic view over the bay so we could see the light show from our room in the…",5,
Stayed for a quick overnight stop F1 Grand Prix grand final night. There were road closures in place but this didn’t really affect us getting to the hotel by cab. We stayed in the Deluxe Garden view room. We had a great view of Gardens by the bay (we were up on the top floors). Room had a small view of pit lane from the balcony. We kept the door open so we could hear the cars racing but you wouldn’t know they were close if your door was closed. The hotel was very busy with racing spectators. Bars & restaurants upstairs were pretty much booked up. The room key system limits where you go in the hotel- aka only hotel guests are able to enter the pool area. This is great as it’s good to have some privileges if you are a guest! Pool gets cleaned at 6pm - swimmers must hop out. Takes…,5,
"We stayed here in December 2017 for my wife's birthday, 5 nights. The room great . The service great. The staff above and beyond . Val and Lawrence in the dinning room ,you guys are the greatest. We so look forwards to coming back",5,
"Went back to Singapore after living there for a short time 40 years ago. The changes were massive. We stayed at Marina Bay and from there we visited lots of places which was fantastic. The view from the top of the hotel was just fantastic, both at night and during the day. We also had dinner in the restaurant on top of the building overlooking the harbour.  Amazing.  So were the prices, but not something we do everyday. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable we had one overlooking the gardens which were quite stunning at night. We loved our time there, brought back some good memories ",5,
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights last week. We really enjoyed our time at this hotel. We felt like we were in Vegas! There was so much to do on or near the hotel grounds that you really didn’t need to leave. Location couldn’t be more perfect. Plenty of places to eat, shop, and sight see near by.  The hotel was also extremely clean (which is personally very important to me). Hotel staff were nice and respectful as well.   Areas for hotel improvement:  1. Check in line was ridiculously long  2. Guest celebrating special occasions should feel special when they choose to spend the occasion with you.   Otherwise we had a pleasant experience and would recommend staying here to other guests. ",4,
"Stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for the Singapore Formula 1 weekend. The obvious comments about the place would be it has a feel of the major hotels in Vegas - very big, slick and efficient. The hotel itself is an imposing structure and is almost iconic in the city (much like the Burj Al Arab in Dubai). My biggest praise I have for the place are to its staff. Always pleasant and smiling and nothing being too much trouble. We had a few issues that had been caused by our travel agents and the hotel staff handled it on our behalf with class and efficiency. They ensured our stay was not affected and went out of their way to rectify the situation even though it was not them that had caused it ... they even sent champagne and chocolates to our room as a gesture once it had been…",5,
"You must stay in the hotel at least one night to try to swim the the roof swimming pool Pool is very big and the view is unbelievable  Room is big with two types of view which are garden or bay Breakfast is not bad Nothing free in this hotel , even water need to pay ",4,
"Spacious and  amazing hotel. Breafast was really great , all sorts of variety and delicios which it should be for what it costs to stay here.. The bars and restaurants are great. The pool is amazing. The downfall is irs always crowded. Would i stay again , probably not , it was a once on a lifetime experience",4,
"MBS, as it is affectionately called by locals is a stunning property with an iconic pool on level 57.  Said to be the largest pool in the southern hemisphere, this infinity pool offers sweeping views of the city.  If the property is out of your budget, do what many guests do, stay elsewhere for the bulk of your trip and finish with a couple of days here to finish your visit.  This is a large hotel with about 3,000 rooms.  The standard rooms are perfectly adequate, modern, stylish and elegantly furnished, but you don't stay here for the rooms, it's all about the pool.   Recommended. ",5,
"Huge, well kept. Easy to get lost. So much going on. Like a hotel in Las Vegas. Well kept. Big. Busy with nice atmosphere. Canal boat ride, casino, coffee shops, restaurants and more. Plus the famous infinity pool only for hotel guests. ",5,
"We stayed here for one night in a deluxe room. This place is amazing. We are not used to staying at luxury hotels, so maybe other people who are used to this will have other opinions.  Location: The hotel has a very good location. There is an MRT station underground. You can walk directly to Gardens by the bay and the shopping mall next to the hotel (there is a walkway that connects these places that goes trough the hotel).  Room: The deluxe room with city view was one of the best rooms we have had in our travels. The curtains open themselves when you walk into the room! The bathroom is spacious (no bathtub).  Pool: I think a lot of people obviously come here for the pool view. We stayed here for 3 hours to watch the sunset and nightlights come to life in the city. This was the…",5,
"Really luxurious, spacious and classy rooms with a very big balcony overlooking the beautiful Gardens by the Bay! As soon we went to the lobby, we were flooded with the a lot of people! However it was overlooked because of the main attraction which was its infinity pool! We had attended the Halloween bash at the rooftop bar with an amazing view! What a great stay!",4,
"As part of a longer trip to Singapore we checked in for the weekend. We had a club room on the 38th floor, tower 2 with stunning views of Singapore. The room itself was large and spacious.   Club room allowed us access to the lounge where we enjoyed an amazing breakfast, afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks. You also have a separate check in area so well worth the upgrade.   Of course the main reason for our stay was to visit the  infinity pool and  it did not disappoint with amazing views of Singapore and a fun atmosphere. ",5,
"Marina Bay Sands Hotel it’s a must visit place when you go to Singapore. Everything is amazing ...the view, the room, the infinity pool, the breakfast...everything. And everything was perfect there, from the beginning to the end. Very comfortable bed, fast elevators, very kind staff, very good breakfast and the experience with the pool- quite special. Only one thing to have in mind:you will spend time at checkin and at checkout,the staff is efficient, but there are a lot of people.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a must-visit location in Singapore. It is famous for many things, but as a visitor to the city, it is fun to experience all that MBS has to offer. It is good for couples, friends, and families. Don’t miss out on one of the most famous hotels in the world while you are in Singapore. ",5,
"I am going to keep this short and sweet, I hated this hotel. The room itself was bland, boring and lacked any style, whatever service their might be, was of a get em in get em out cheap Las Vegas style variety.  Our room allowed us to go to an afternoon tea, which was hideous, with people scrambling for food, taking it with their hands and shovelling it into their mouth before they could make it back to their table.  We went upstairs to the pool area and the view is spectacular. You just have to overlook all the bodies bobbing up and down in the fetid warm water. What finished me off was the parents who allowed their child to pee straight in the pool.  I promptly went downstairs cancelled my second nights booking and got the hell out.  For $600 plus a night I expect a whole lot…",1,
Stayed here for 2 nights with my extended family. The hotel is very big and you can easily spend your whole trip to Singapore on the hotels property. The rooms are big and cozy with an amazing view. Service is excellent and the room are very clean. The rooftop infinity pool is spectacular where you have view of the city while you swim or lay by the pool. You can walk from the hotel to The gardens by the bay and there is a big shopping mall on the property. Top restaurants at the hotel and nearby and nice to walk around the bay.  ,5,
"Treated ourselves to a few nights in a king club room for a big birthday.  On arrival, we were 3 hours before Check in, but our bags were whisked away so that we could get the process underway. We're given passes to begin enjoying the hotel facilities, and told we would receive an email when our room was ready. In less than half an hour we received the email, and were in the room. Fantastic, huge, comfortable, amazing.  Nesprsso Coffee machine with variety of choices, teas and a kettle.  Tea is served in club 55 as part of the room price from 2-4.  Delicious! Every day the food items were different, and delicious.  You can have any soft beverage, not just tea! Then at 5-7 alcohol and soft drinks and canapes are served in club 55.  The food again, amazing.  Cheeses, fruit, hot…",5,
We took a room at 53  floor for me my wife and 17th year old daughter.  We pay for three persons but the third bed was to small for an adult. We got a garden view room  the room was big clean . The view is one of a kind. We are breakfast at business lunch and it was very good. And very luxury.  The pool is the most amazing pool in the world. Every thing was perfect it cost but its worth.  The location is also in best place near every thing and near mt. Don't miss this hotel if you are in Singapore. ,5,
"Beautiful hotel, lots of things to see and do close by. Taxi to and from airport was approx 18singapore dollars. Gorgeous view overlooking the gardens. Worth every cent. Hotel staff sent a beautiful anniversary cake to our room. Felt the love by all staff",5,
Came here for a long weekend getaway with my wife to celebrate her birthday. It was a luxurious stay that was extremely relaxing and received excellent service from all staff. great views from the gym and infinity pool is as brilliant as depicted in photo's.,5,
"This was a must try for us when visiting Singapore, upon arrival the lobby is huge and the  queue for check in was rather large and the lobby busy with mainly non guests. The room was lovely very big and bathroom was great. However, given the level of hotel and costs there are quite a few moans coming! Severe lack of tea and coffee facilities in the room, I know this is minor but you even get this in budget hotels. Water was on a severe shortage! we asked for more and didn't get it.   I do think that they need to separate the paying hotel guests from the general public, it was like a circus most of the time and not relaxing in the general hotel areas. We went to the pool (one of the main attractions!) and yes we expected it to be busy but people trying to sell you photos and…",3,
"Decided to stay here after seeing Crazy Rich Asian movie, the infinity pool was the main reason we want to stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean and we had the view of downtown and the fountain light show. the restaurant specifically the service at spago and the pool area was excellent, very friendly and prompt. ",5,
"Stayed here during our Singapore stay and it's been an overwhelming experience for the family. Situated in the City Centre with it's very own shopping malls, catering up to high end brands. Friendly staff, very busy check in counter (prepare at least 45 minutes to an hour). Make sure you know which tower you have booked into, as there are different check in counters on every tower (you wouldn't want to queue on a wrong counter). The Infinity pool is amazing, you really cannot swim as it's too crowded but enough space to dip in and take a selfie. This is really luxury!",5,
Relax your day Walk 10 kms to make ur pot go down by 1” Have fun around the park with nature and sun Few places to have a snack or a meal 🥘  Take water with you.   Make sure to watch the laser show and to enjoy the night ,4,
"Check in queue far too long - needs to be urgently addressed. As with other guests we were staying to experience the hype of the infinity pool - pool was great if very, very  busy - had to wait for beds near pool. Towels at pool great -.plenty and warm. Room service surprisingly good and efficient. Overall a one off hotel experience that’s a tick box. ",4,
"you see this hotel from all around the city.  its 30$ to get to the top and you can only get to a small part you cannot get to the pool area, thats for guests only.   but its a great picture taking place there is also a restaurant and bar ontop",5,
"We took a family room for a couple of nights.  The room was very big, with two toilets and one shower room.  It also has a mini kitchen area (really only for coffees and other drinks), and a sofa.  It also had a massive balcony, but we didn't use it.  My only criticism of these rooms are that they are on the first couple of levels so if you do want to sit on the balcony you will get a lot of road noise.  Once the sliding doors are shut though, you hear nothing.    Beds were only ok - a little too hard, but that is better than them being too soft I suppose....  But the hotel facilities, and restaurants are fantastic.  The roof top pool is obviously the focal point and whilst its impressive its probably not reason enough to stay here to be honest.  Its almost always crowded, and…",5,
"MBS is a Singapore icon. Very fast and efficient service. But quite pricey. But good for a once/month night out. Excellent roof top bars, and weekends get very busy, so plan ahead. Building is a marvel.",4,
"If you think you saw it all, first visit this hotel, from the moment you enter the hotel you get amazed with the grandiosity of it. From the roof top you get the most beautiful scenery of Singapore, located in the heart of Singapore.",5,
"I don't understand why the ratings of MBS are dropping down. First of all we didnt have to wait a Q, the service was all well arranged so in only 10 minutes after arrival, we were accommodated in our beautiful room. The room was spacious, very clean and had a great view  (especially in the night) of the Shoppes and city. I combined my trip from Bali to Singapore just to go to Marina Bay Sands ( one of the main reasons) as it gave Singapore a symbol to identify with. (At least in my opinion) The infinity pool is just amazing and we visited during day and night and it was never crowded. Except great views to experience on top of 57 floors, we also took some great amazing photos there. From MBS we even didn't have to cross any roads because the shoppes and Gardens by the bay were…",5,
"I can't stress enough how amazing these buildings are. There's a huge ship on the top with a pool overlooking all of Singapore. Don't forget to bring your swimsuit, and remember to order some of the delicious drinks up there.",5,
"After visiting 8 countries in 8 weeks we felt a nice stop to relax in Singapore was a good idea. The visit to Singapore was great but staying at the Marina Bay Sands was not a good choice. It’s mostly ridiculously busy with people coming and going. Not a hotel to choose if you want to just chill out. The 3 restaurants were always full, the music blaring at breakfast 🙄(inappropriate music choice for dining) and would be great if there was a adults only area - just a break from children crying or having a tantrum. Holidayers who pay lots of dollars for a 5 Star Hotel would expect 5 star treatment  which includes, accommodation, meals and general atmosphere.",3,
"Sure, the Marina Bay Sands is spectacular from the outside already, and the pool indeed is a spectacular experience. So it is worth a visit and great fun, but once seen alternatives can be considered.. Check-in is is organized, but due to the sheer size of the place it feels like an airport with mass processing.  Once in the room things get better: Pleasant design and great views. Definitely worth to go for the higher rooms with city view.  Then the roof-top pool: just great, particularly early in the morning before the crowds come in. In a nutshell, a fun and spectacular experience worth to see, however, if you are looking for a calm, refined place with elegance, the Marina is not the place.",5,
Admittedly the building structure and pool area is amazing.  However that’s the only redeeming feature.  We expected a whole lot more for the money we paid. Do yourself a favour and just pay to access the top floor bar and stay elsewhere.  ,2,
"Easy access to shopping mall , restaurant and many interesting places around that area. I luv the scenary there. Winderful place to visit either alone or with family members. Transportation is easy by taxi or using the tube located near the hotel",4,

"I already had accommodation in Singapore but it was my mother's 70th birthday so took her for a swim with my sisters.  But I knew that since my last visit the pool is hot property and accessed now only with a room key.  So I booked a night there and we went for a swim and enjoyed a cocktail by the pool and dinner at CE LA VI before returning to our own hotel.  Yes it's amazing, but the pool is super crowded these days and honestly for me, I questioned whether it was worth it.  Our own hotel also had a rooftop pool which we enjoyed more as there was no one in it!  They sent an ""amenities pack"" to the room for my mother's birthday.  Thanks for the thought, but all of the amenities you sent were already in the bathroom.  So my advice if you are thinking  of splurging for one night…",3,
A friend and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in a premiere twin garden view room on the last leg of our trip on Aug 2-3. Most of the previous reviews are accurate... it’s Marina Bay Sands expect a massive resort (three separate towers combined only at the ground & roof levels) with lux amenities(think your window curtains automatically open when you put your room key in the door) and close proximity to the gardens by the bay and mall. Normally I write pros and cons but I think it’s more helpful to cover the issues I read that concerned me before staying at the resort.  1) lines at checkin - YES there will be a line. But the line moves fairly quickly (unless some thoughtless person leaves their passport inside their luggage and hunts for it while in front of the check-in desk...…,4,
"The breakfast at the rooftop restaurant was delicious! We tasted many different foods authentic to the area. The buffet style was great way to try everything. The breakfast staff was especially helpful and friendly. They were happy to answer our questions, give us recommendations on what to try, and gave us an overall unique and pleasant experience.",5,
"Hotel building, grounds, pool, roof top were all awesome - rooms nothing great,  typical room (we had city view 30th floor-great for water/light show viewing).   The roof top is the place to be, gorgeous pool and awesome views.  The convention center along with shops across the street also A+.  The water and lights show a must see! Train station is attached, Gardens By the Bay & Singapore Flyer all within walking distance.",4,
"There is no question the hotel is striking in design but that’s were it ends. The famous roof top pool is only good for selfies. The price we paid for our room with club access was not worth it at all.   As one can’t really sit and relax by the pool as there are hords of people taking selfies and jumping in and out. Very very crowded. You line up just to get into the pool area. You line up to get into the club lounge, you line up pretty much for everything. There are options for club guests to have breakfast but it goes from bad to worse with the line ups. So no matter we’re you chose to have breakfast please be ready to line up no matter if you are on club level or not. Also line up for a taxi was pretty long. The mall attached to the hotel was very nice. The only staff member…",1,
Great architecture and a bustling place. Roof pool is a must but is very crowded. I think the hotel is a victim of its own success  since my only complaint would be that its is to busy. To be fair its amazing the way the hotel is run to such high standards with the sheer volume of people it caters for.,4,
"Staff here are fantastic, we stayed in a City view king room and it's been superb. It included the Club 55 which is well worth the money, the breakfast is amazing with lots of choice, it's calmer and more relaxing than the other restaurants for breakfast. Special thank you to Vella in Club 55 who always remembered our names and gave it that personal touch. If you play it right with Club 55 you won't need lunch as they then do afternoon tea at 2pm so it's basically half board.  The guest services are also very good, we had a whole range of animals made for us out of towels, they also noticed what we were using most out of tea and coffee and gave us more of what we used.  The skypark is great to be able to use as and when you please as a hotel guest.  The infinity pool is very…",5,
"The hotel is definitely not cheap but the view from the pool is worth the expensive rooms. I have stayed there for my birthday and I got an upgrade. The room looked absolutely excellent, the view was impressive. But nothing compared to the well known infinity pool. Talking a bath in that pool after sunset and watching the breathtaking view of the port and the city is one of the best experiences ever.",5,
"booked a king club room to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. hoped for a nice relaxing long weekend. the hotel trashed that idea from the moment we entered the lobby.  If you want a trip where your senses are assaulted from the moment you arrive, where loud pumping music bursts your eardrums, where the chilly pool is standing room only, where the foreground of you singapore view is a whole load of people spending hours trying to get that perfect facebook selfie........then go ahead - come here. you get the idea.The pool is crowded and full of kids from 6am to 11pm. Yep, the kids are still there at that time - dont they have beds to go to? If you want a relaxing getaway - go somewhere else   Its a very average, busy hotel that happens to have an interesting pool. You have…",1,
"Excellent stay! Completely worth the money! To have the unique chance of using the iconic rooftop infinity pool, you have to stay at the hotel. Beside the pool, there were 2 hot water Jacuzzi which I enjoyed very much! Have the free access to the sky park also. Only drawback was the time taken to check-in. Checking-out process for non mini bar users was fast. Have excellent before check-in and after check-out baggage service also. Don't miss the free of charge light show at 8.00 pm and 9.30 pm near the mall also.",5,
"My friend and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands while on vacation in Singapore and, while the entire hotel is amazing, we have to give special thanks to Earl and all the employees on staff for the rooftop breakfast at Spago! From the hosts to the bartenders and servers alike- They went above and beyond to make us comfortable and ensure we had everything we needed. They answered any questions we had about the local breakfast foods and everyone was so happy and helpful and having a great time- the food was delicious and the environment is so relaxing. We would definitely recommend this experience to anyone and everyone!",5,
"Stayed here for 3 nights. The minute you see this hotel in the distance you’re in awe of the architectural masterpiece that it is. The main reception area is an open atrium leaving you wondering who gets the job of redecorating it! We had a park view room on the 14th floor. It takes a while to navigate your way around the three towers as the lifts don’t go to all floors. If you’ve booked a table, etc, in the hotel then allow yourself some extra time to find it!   Our room was spacious and had a desk and settee. We weren’t particularly able to use the balcony due to the traffic noise.   A trip to the Skydeck (free to guests, as well as a visit to Gardens by the Bay) as well as trying out the infinity pool are a must. I’m not great with heights but I knew if I didn’t see both of…",4,
"When you enter, there was no big wow factor,  but it is nice.  Everyone was friendly, check in was fast.  We stayed here one night, and were upgraded to a superior room, which was pretty amazing.  So big, a comfortable bed, huge bathroom, and fab city views from high up.  Wifi was good from everywhere. The pool is what you pay for - it was stunning, very well kept, plenty of space, and views were out of this world.  Pool service was good, with a good selection of drinks.  We didn't eat in the hotel, preferring to instead, go to the many restaurants in the mall below.  Most of the facilities can be accessed without staying in the hotel, but we did feel a little more important than others, being able to go to the pool, and of course our room.  Sunset and sunrise from the pool are…",4,
"This place doesn’t need any good feedback, but I can’t refrain myself to say something!! We got the club room where it’s included the afternoon tea, aperitif and the breakfast..each of these has been perfect from the quality of food to the staff! Nothing to say about the room and the view that was simply perfect! Infinity pool!?! OMG! We loved Marina Bay Sands and Singapore!!",5,
Had a chance to stay here again after our first stay 2 years back. Amazing complex and you can stay here for a week without leaving the property.  We were very happy to make a new friend Mao Xin this time round who made us the most creative and cutest arrangements using towels and flowers.   It was an awesome stay. A big thank you to Mao Xin and the hotel VP that has done a great job with the hotel. ,5,
"We had a good stay, the front desk tried their best to get us two rooms together as we had requested and we ended up close. Its huge, busy and impersonal, pretty much like being in Vegas. I can't say there's anything that really wowed me, but nothing that disappointed either. The view is spectacular and the rooftop infinity pool is just what you were imagining. Given the number of people around and going through the pools they do a good job of keeping it clean and sane. Can't say I'd rush back, but its worth experiencing and if you're in Singapore you have to have the Infinity Pool photo.",4,
Me and my girlfriend visited marina bay sands in August 2018 just for 1 night stay. From the moment you arrive it just has that WOW factor from the architecture to the service. The room was amazing as well as the view from the balcony overlooking 'Gardens by the Bay'. It's obviously extremely expensive but if you're only looking to go Singapore a couple of times in your life then you have to try atleast 1 night here. Thank you for everything! Adam and Christina x,5,
"What to say, among the best 3 hotels I ever visited with its infinity pool at 57th floor which is breathtaking even if always crowded. Only bad experience at Italian restaurant where the hostess told us that there were no seats available so to stay at the lounge, after 5 minutes waiting we decided to leave as it was extremely uncomfortable seating and at that point a colleague told us there that were a table at main restaurant (actually more than one)....",5,
"what a view. form the outside, it is a magnificent structure. from the top, a fantastic view of the island. a must go to spot in Singapore.  stayed a night here to experience the hotel and was very impressed. definitely a world class hotel.",5,
we didn't stay at the hotel (too expensive) so we only pay to go up to the top to the viewing deck.  it is worth the money and the trip.  We have a drink at the lounge and too could experience the magical view of the whole harbour. definitely worth the money to get up to the top of this building. Highly recommended. ,5,
"A now famous landmark in singapore. Due to the size of the hotel, don’t expect luxurious personal service. The rooms are ok and obviously have good views. Hence the rates are expensive. The infinity pool is also an instagram favourite but usually crowded. The rooftop restaurant ce la vi has the view but ok food and service",4,
"Absolutely wonderful stay, staff at check in was wonderful and very helpful. The hotel rooms are big and comfortable with nice view. Pool is unique and great ever view and is big enough too. Very near to center area  and also clean room housekeeping doing great job.. We will be back to stay in this hotel again.",5,
"This is our third stay at Marina Bay Sands. As usual the spaciousness meant that our family of 4 felt very comfortable. It was great to have balcony space to enjoy the beautiful scenery.   Our boys especially love the infinity pool - “their favourite swimming pool”.   On this visit, we were disappointed that the pool staff did not seem to be vigilant in monitoring and releasing sun beds which were occupied / reserved by guests who were not even by the pool.   We were at the pool for abt 3 hours. When we arrived, we saw 4 men getting dressed but left their towels on the sun beds. 1.5 hours later, I enquired with staff why were beds reserved by towels despite no one being there. I was told that staff checked every 45 minutes but they hadn’t. In the end, I had to insist that…",4,
"We have visited the Marina Bay Sands a couple of times, but never stayed here.    The building itself is simply stunning and is a must see & iconic part of Singapore.  The terrace on the roof has an infinity edged pool, restaurants and bars.  One of the sections, on the western end is open to the public (for a fee) while the pool and majority of the deck area is for hotel guests only.  This hotel is always so very busy that I actually don’t want to stay here.  It’s also well away from Chinatown, Little India, the main shopping and dining areas.  Yes, it’s close for Gardens by the Bay and part of the new financial downtown area, but for tourists, not a great spot to stay.  But visit and enjoy one of the worlds great modern buildings.",4,
"Very pleased we stayed here. Comfortable room and fantastic service however the hotel is always busy 24/7. The infinity pool on the roof was awesome but always crowded and was very difficult to get a sun bed. As it was so busy it was hard to relax and too many people for them to provide the personal touch. Glad we stayed though, everyone should experience this hotel once.",4,
"Yes, a big thank you to Marina Bay Sands. We left our cash behind upon check-out. Within half an hour, we received an e-mail alerting us. We made the phone call and return to claim it. After verification we got our cash back. Very grateful indeed. The matter was professionally handled.   Great Singaporean honesty and integrity.   Nevertheless, we did not quite enjoy our stay there, marred by very poor reception.   We have to queue almost 40 minutes to get checked-in. The hotel lobby didn’t have the ambience we expected. We felt like walking into a transport terminal, because of the public access. No one smile, no one care. We just thought we were in a bus terminal somewhere, waiting in line to board. No warm welcome gesture.   The much talked-about infinity pool : when we went…",3,
Me and my husband stayed at MBS for a business trip in August and it was a great experience. We got a really nice room on the 32nd floor with garden view. The best of all was really the infinity pool on the 57th floor but it is interesting so many people are more interested in taking selfies instead of enjoying the view. ,5,
Yes it’s expensive but thoroughly worth it. I visited as a guest and headed up to the Bar on the top floor. The view was spectacular and just a must do. I visited on a Friday night so it was super busy but everyone was friendly.,5,
"a super nice hotel, from lobby to luxury big rooms with breathtaking view to nice big bathrooms.i stay there one night with my family and my kids love it and wish they go there every year. the infinity pool on 57 floor feel like you swim in the sky the best pool in the world.",5,
This is the iconic building in Singapore. We were there for our anniversary and the hotel staff treated us very good. Booked the junior-suite and the views were amazing.  Don't forget to visit the famous pool on the roof for some selfies.,5,
Had the wonderful privilege to stay in the Orchid Suite for my sister's birthday. Check in was easy and they were very accommodating with our ice sculpture that we had for the birthday girl. Huge bath tub and bed. Not to mention the incredible night view and rooftop infinity pool. We had free access to the club too but did not end up going. Highly recommended!,4,
"This mall is located next to Marina bay Sands Hotel. It has many branded outlets and restaurants. There is a casino,too. There is a canal passing through it.Exclusive place for shopping. A theatre is located there too.",4,
"Amazing in every respect. The building is spectacular and the staff are incredible. It just makes you go ‘Wow’. The best hotel we’ve ever stayed in and we have travelled widely, but only within Europe and N.America up until this stay. It is 5 star and at a 5 star price but you certainly get what you pay for. There are not enough superlatives to describe the experience here. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who are uniformly friendly, polite and very helpful. They all seem to make a point of remembering your name, wherever you are in the hotel and this adds to the personal touch, which is a difficult ask in such a huge place with so many guests. The food is phenomenal and I have never seen such a huge array of food on offer at breakfast. Would love to return here. ",5,
The view from the hotel and the rooftop pool are second to none. I was just speechless seeing such beauty.,5,
"...it is expensive but we got plenty of extras coming with it so it was worth it, the views from the pool and the oservation terrace is a need to see in singapore and from our balcony at night we could see the garden tree light shows....wow",4,
Stayed here with my wife for 2 nites during our first time visit to Singapore. Picked to stay here because of the famous pool and it did not disappoint! Absolutely stunning and just as surreal when seen in person!! The service by the pool was great and the food and drinks were good and reasonably priced. The room was very nice as well. A must visit when coming to Singapore just for the pool and views alone!,5,
"This place is amazing- I’m not sure I can even write and describe how good this hotel is. We stayed here for three nights and would never stay anywhere else again. When we arrived staff took our luggage for us to the room, we were not due to check in until 3pm however we landed early and the hotel accommodated this and managed to get us an early check in to get some rest! The staff were all very friends throughout the stay and were helpful with whatever we needed. We had a room overlooking gardens by the bay and the views from here was amazing, not to mention to rooms were spotless and huge.  Even if you are not staying here I would recommend going to the top floor where the infinity pool is - the views from here are superb.. even more so at night!!  100% somewhere everyone…",5,
Just returned last night from Singapore and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands.  I could not have been happier.  We stayed in an Orchid Suite which had a private check in lounge.  We arrived pretty early from Los Angeles.  Around 9AM and somehow found us a room and let us check-in early.  That in itself was amazing.  Go for the amazing pool. It's worth it.  Restaurants were good and shopping was like being in Vegas. Did some gambling as well. The hotel has an MRT stop so you can get anywhere in the city with ease.  Give this place a try. We will back.,5,
"Excellent, a big hotel but the service is very personal. fab location and most iconic hotel to stay at.     You are looked after as soon as you step into the hotel.  During check in there is a man walking the queue welcoming you to MBS with ice cream and water.  Saniya @ check in was excellent as was all staff we met.    The infinity pool is major pull to this hotel. the quietest time at the pool is between 11am to 3pm when ppl have checked out and new guests yet to check in.    Food is pricey but that is expected.  We had all our meals at the Raspura food court a 5 mins walk.  Seriously if you want to feel like a somebody check into this hotel.    The spa is amazing and the tea lounge nice place to visit but the treatments very pricey.    We stayed there three night and spent…",5,
"It’s a nice place and integrated, mall, park, and museum.. for the restaurant they have Lavo at 57 floor, it’s Italian restaurant.. i brunch in this restaurant.. in this floor we can found a pool and another day i go to Club 55 for breakfast, this place have a awesome view Garden by The Bay..",5,
"really is the best for a long stay at this luxury hotel, all facilities are available. Very easy access and excellent service. then if you want to shop the number one is marina bay sands. Best view arround singapore",5,
"In reality if it wasn't for the dramatic swimming pool perched on the roofs of the three towers that comprise this hotel, there is no need to stay here. It's expensive and is located by itself on the opposite side of the lake where everything else of the city is situated.   There is a mall full of expensive designer stores underneath and across the road. More importantly a massive food court full of various Asian stands. Which you should eat at considering the extortionate prices within the hotel for sometimes terrible food. There are also expensive restaurants.  The three towers of the hotel join at their bases to create a huge cathedral like space where you'll find reception desks, concierge, shops; the hotel has it own gift shop, bakery and restaurants. It's all reminiscent…",4,
"Definitely recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Singapore for the first time just for the experience!  Travelled with my boyfriend and we decided to stop at Marina Bay Sands for our last night in Singapore (we spent the previous 2 nights elsewhere just due to price).   Check in: Super quick and easy.  Rooms: Much bigger than I thought, very clean and modern. We had a city view room and it was fantastic with views right over the bay and the buildings/skyline. We could even watch the light show from our own room on the evening. Glad we chose this view.  Pool: Must say we chose to stay in this hotel so we could use the pool! It did not disappoint. Although it was always busy, we always managed to get a lounger and the views and experience generally was incredible.  …",5,
"I am blown away by the service provided by the staff of this hotel. Usually the typical minded will be that the staffs at a hotel this big will provide the mediocre service, but after my ‘staycation’ here, it has changed my perception.  Everyone here from the front desk, to the room service team helped make this stay great. (I unfortunately did not get any names from the room service team, but you were absolutely outstanding for helping bring the cake that I arranged to be sent at midnight!) (25th June midnight team) all of you are stars!  At the desk, Vemal, a very professional individual handle my request very promptly. He assisted me despite me already checked in with another tower. And while assisting he showed great character and portrayed himself very well as an ambassador…",5,
"I really debated staying because of the price tag, but I'm so glad I did! The hotel room is big, elegant and with a spectacular room. Customer service is outstanding! And of course, the infinity pool is one of a kind. DO NOT DEBATE IT: stay here!!",5,
"When visiting Singapore, staying in MBS is a must. I stayed at the Club Room. Although it's a little bit more expensive than the common one, I definitely recomend it. The infinity pool is also incredible.",4,
"A very lovely place to stay and enjoy roof top swimming pool with amazing views. Centrally located with a few attractions just walking distance away.garden by bay,museum,flyer,merlion park just to name a few.worth paying a few hundred extra compared to other hotels in singapore.",5,
"Celebrating my anniversary and my son's birthday in Marina Bay was so spectacular with the best view and dining experience at rooftop! Big room and big bathroom. The most important that me and my family can see city view, shopping mall, botanic garden, merlion, harbour, river, fireworks at night, just in one window from my room! Will be back soon in the world class hotel with professional staff!",5,
"This hotel is truly a masterpiece! I stayed on the 23 rd floor - facing the light show, and although high up, i had a free show every night !  :)  Pool on roof is on the top 5 list in the world..... dining in was pricing, but that's Singapore!  There are so many places to eat just outside the hotel, it is not hard to find something.  MRT (SUBWAY) is right under the hotel, and so, getting out and about is a dream. Also has a large mall built right in to it.",5,
What an amazing view they have. My partner and I loved visiting Marina Bay Sands as part of our honeymoon around Asia and enjoyed some cocktails and bar food there. The views were breathtaking and the food and drinks were delicious. It was a little bit pricey but expected due to the location of the bar. ,5,
"We stayed here two nights at then end our holiday. We had a garden view room which was spacious, the rooms are expensive but was we stayed for the experience. Marina bay has so much around it, we saw lion king at the theatre. Walked to the Merlion, art science centre. The infinity pool was amazing.  Loved it",5,
"This is, of course, a casino hotel and everything is built around this key preoccupation. If you have ever been to Las Vegas or Macau this Sands Hotel will seem very familiar. Yet there are also other attractions. The hotel is part of a mega mall with designer stores and restaurants to please the heart of any shopper. In the evening there is often a live show and it is best to get tickets at the hotel otherwise it will mean a trip into Macau's city centre. Also at night there is a light show that is very pleasant to watch. Outside the hotel but very close are the Gardens by the Bay - a number of cooled conservatories that not only offer respite from the Singapore heat but also some extraordinary plant life. The  pièce de résistance, however, is the roof top swimming pool. Not…",4,
"They’ve now introduced a ticketing scheme for access to the top floor, it’s costs $20 each and you can ‘spend it on a drink’! The cheapest drink is around $20++! I paid $47 for a 330ml beer and a ‘cheap’ house white wine. Yes, the view is great, on a clear day, but they’ve also now restricted where visitors are allowed to stand/sit. No, I won’t visit again........",4,
"For the price I paid for my room I felt was way too expensive. There was nothing flash about the room. The best thing was the view, out to sea, looking over the world famous Gardens by the Bay. That was amazing.  Of all the staff in the hotel, I found only two people who offered exceptional service, They were both at the check in/check out desk near tower 3.",4,
" “It was an amazing experience and they were lovely for the final night of our honeymoon, and wow were the beds comfy!! Worth the price. Don't forget to take advantage of the lifestyle rewards!!” Thanks you marina bay sand",5,
"A must stop if you visit Singapore...  Best hotel experience we've had in a very long time... Service - Tops, Location - Tops, F&B - Tops  Facilities - absolutely fantastic.  Pool visit obviously great, right next to the Gardens, a short walk away.  Hotel F&B prices reasonable around poolside etc. although restaurants fairly pricey. Booking and Check in/out much better than the norm.  Our luggage was misplaced en route, the concierge dis a fantastic job assisting us to have it delivered.  We could only book two nights of or trip and had to move along to another hotel.  Immediately missed the spacious rooms, Proximity to other facilities and the service we got accustomed to. Will definitely return.",5,
We stayed in the hotel on our way back from Bali (to Amsterdam). It is an amazing building. The staff is wonderful. Service is great. It has 2500 rooms but only at the amazing swimmingpool one experiences the number of people. It was very crowdy in and around the pool. But still one needs to go up there to experience the infinity pool on the 57th floor with a view over Singapore. We were very lucky because we got an upgrade to a 330 sq/m suite.,5,
Stayed for two nights on a business trip. Hotel is huge but doesn't lose the personal touch. Common areas very (perhaps too) busy. Rooms are first class with stunning views either side. The infinity pool on the top floor is simply stunning - didn't get a chance to use it but the view from the top is breathtaking.,5,
"This hotel is truly massive. Once inside it takes 10 minutes to walk to the other end. The decor in the rooms is neutral and good quality and staff are fairly efficient  The pool is amazing and has to be visited, they police access very carefully so remember your card Adults and family pools is a good touch so you don’t need to put up with annoying little ones if you don’t have yours with you! Drinks etc at pool fair prices given the location.  Marina views amazing, watch the light shows in the bay from up here The restaurants in the hotel were very overpriced with poor quality food and service was generally very poor We were very disappointed with the food and service especially given a basic meal with one drink was over £200 for the two of us Go somewhere else, just grab an…",4,
"Check in was easy and they keep you entertained with juice and ice cream while you wait. Communication was very bad for a big hotel like this. After my booking online, I asked questions which were never replied to. Breakfast is something I look forward to it was nothing exciting at all. Maybe my expectations were high for the money I paid. Infinity pool is an experience and that about it. ",3,
"Spending 2 nights in Singapore recently meant that I had to try Marina Bay Sands.Good and easy online booking system and direct contact via emails regarding arrival times and check in made me feel comfortable. On arrival I was surprised to find such a HUGE lobby and literally hundreds of people milling around (in hindsight, I don't know why I was surprised as MBS has 2500 rooms!)  Our cases were whisked away and there was a long snaking line to check in. Luckily we had booked  the club lounge package and spied a door to the club lounge check in on the far right. Upon entering you take a paper number from a little machine (yes, like at the deli counter) and sit on a couch while waiting for 1 of 4 desks to become free and your number on the tv screen to be displayed. We waited…",3,
"Rooms were amazing and so were the views and bathrooms, however in this hotel you're more of a number than a guest. The pool is spectacular but it is ridiculously busy, not a relaxing atmosphere. To be able to relax by the pool or have a quiet breakfast, you'd need to be up at the crack of dawn!",4,
As we landed in chinese new year they charge 30krs per night but they dont provided basic room service n room were okok not all worth staying there. Food has indian menu almost all resturant in singapore has indian menu.,3,
"The staff is very helpful, kind & friendly. Rooms' quality is in line with the fares to be paid. Cleaning & refilling complimentary items more than once a day, each kind of comfort, but the real excellence is the panoramic pool on the rooftop. Simply unmissable! The view over the bay and the city is astonishing! Restaurants inside the hotel can offer a varying and tasty menu every time/ every day. The hotel is just 5 minutes walking from the metro station ""Bayfront"", il You arrive there by using public transports. Strongly recommended for vacations or business trips!!! 🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝",5,
"A mediocre hotel in a spectacular building, that’s it!! More than in a luxurious resort, you have the feeling to be in an amusement park: giant towers, rooftop infinity pool, but way too many restriction, controls, rules to go by, pass needing to go here and there. basically a stressful experience, way far from the kind of treatment that a paying customer (and te bill is not certainly cheap) is expecting from an exclusive resort. Here nothing is exclusive, as a matter of fact: every place is crowded, loud and basically you have to pass thru a line for everything (our first breakfast took us 20 min just to be seated), not to mention the pool experience, which is truly breathtaking for the view, but overcrowded, noisy and almost impossible to find a deckchair after 8.30 am.…",1,
"There is nothing special about this hotel, it like staying in an airport, the lobby area is crazy you have to line up for everything and wait. Staff are all friendly, rooms are basis and service is standard nothing more. ",3,
"It had been a dream of mine to stay at Marina Bay Sands....and it lived up to every expectation I had! Beautiful rooms, helpful staff, you really wouldn't have to leave the place for anything! Terrific restaurants, shopping, facilities. Definitely shall stay here again!!!",5,
I have never been in any place where everybody I mean all people you meet were so nice helpful and very honest. I should spend more time in Singapore than Vegas . Room is at tower 3  54th floor Sky View (cost S$7500 a week) so we were exited to see the room but It was  just a big  plain room nothing colorful (no WOW from my wife) it was big with a very nice view of the city (priceless) and of course the pool (on the 57th floor) the reason why we went to Singapore to have our pictures  taken at the pool.  But we did not go in the poll till the 4th day  Monday about noon less people you can do laps without bumping to anybody.  Casino has  the best security going in and going out.,5,
"Room was awesome, room was on 39 floor, sea & garden view from room simply great, view from infinity pool was great, receptionist on check in was very friendly, just have 1 complaint during check out, all formalities, luggage moving tooks more than 1 hour, but overall I'm satisfied.",5,
"Amazing hotel great rooms but this hotel is a commercial beast as it has lots of people just visiting the place who are not residents. The pool on the roof is again fantastic with views like no other but is so busy you can hardly move up there.... Service is not great whilst having breakfast and whilst eating off my plate at the time all the waiting was interested in was shoving the bill under my nose to get it signed which was very rude. Overall great place, very busy and staff need to realise it is a 5 star hotel and respect their customers.",3,
"Beautiful scene, I still love this place although I have come here many times. wide area and fresh air, so we could enjoy and relax. It is also very convenient to visit many places around Marina Bay by many links.",4,
We decided to splurge and stay at the Marina Bay Sands on a whim. It did not disappoint. The view was spectacular as we stayed on the Ship Channel side. The room was large and had a small balcony that over looked the ocean and the lighted gardens. It was a great place to catch the light show in the gardens at night. The pool was amazing and is a must do! The observation deck on the other side was worth a trip to see that side of the city and the Ferris Wheel. And finally the mall and food choices were amazing!,5,
Singapore trip was for a reunion with old friends. It has been 6 years since my last visit. MBS was selected since it was in the center of the newest attractions. For hotel goers amenable to large crowds and with a budget to spend.  PROS: 1. VERY big and grand hotel with complete amenities. 2. Roofdeck pool was worth all the hype. Magnificent views both day and night. 3. Breakfast buffet available in 3 dining outlets which was convenient. RISE on the GF was the best. 4. We got the suite room so...the works. It even had a 20 sqm balcony fronting the Giant Trees.  COULD BE IMPROVED: 1. Lobby was crowded and check-in even from the VIP lounge took 30 minutes. People were sitting on the floor. 2. Club lounge was full on all the days we were there. Always a queue to get in so we never…,5,
"A few days in a Sands Suite.  There is very little else I can add to the Marina Bay Sands. The place is iconic, outside, inside and on its top.  Despite its size, the attention to details is very high, not easy to keep a full 5 stars standard when dealing with so many guests and rooms. We enjoyed the additional luxury of a butler assigned to our suite, something that adds a particular touch and helps you in getting the best from the place and the city.  The pool area on the top is obviously unmissable but also the surrounding area offers many attractions.  Money very well spent, if you go to Singapore only once, this is the place to go. ",5,
Marina Bay Sands Shopping is very big and nice.  Here you can find all kinds of luxury name brand stores.  The basement level have food court and restaurants. There is a spectacular light/laser fountain show at 8p and 9p at the promenade that is free.  Easy to get to using MRT.,5,
"Nice room, nice view, especially the 57th floor infinity pool where you can see singapore best view 😍! They have celebrity chef's restaurants in the lobby and in the mall. Wanna comeback for the restaurants and entertainment 👍. ",5,
"This is a building which I had become aware of through being an architect and having been to a lecture by the designer, Moshe Safdie, an architect I had long admired. We were due to pass through Singapore on our way home from a fabulous holiday in Indonesia and so we duly booked four nights. First impressions, arriving late at night, did not disappoint. The reception space is spectacular. Our room on the 19th floor of tower 3 was spacious, well appointed and comfortable. We had a large balcony overlooking the gardens which are particularly attractive at night. The next day we explored the rooftop terrace and infinity pool along with the multitude of shops and restaurants on the lower levels. All very glitzy and upmarket. However, what becomes apparent is that the building is…",4,
"Travel to any part of Singapore, one thing that you can surely see from any place is this majestic hotel. Gorgeous, beautiful and modern. Gardens by the bay is nearby and on the other side of river is Merlion.  It is expensive hotel but definitely can be tried for 1 night.",5,
"We were greeted by Ms Joanne after our check in Sands Lounge. She escorted us to our room which were upgraded. Very impressed with the property knowledge of Joanne during the escort to our room. Love the pool very much, will definitely be back again. A big thank you to Joanne for the upgrades and assistance.",5,
We went to Singapore in second time and went to Marina Bay Sand Sky Park at 56 floor. It very amazing view from bird eyes view and We can shopping around in this area.We love here it very amazing.,5,
Location of the hotel is perfect overlooking the lovely city of Singapore. Various selections of high end restaurants are also provided as great options when staying in the hotel with several Michelin star chefs restaurants.  The infinity pool at the top of the building is the highlight of the hotel overlooking the city in different angles.   A must place to stay and experience whilst in SG!,5,
"I felt Marina Bay Sands was very over-rated - however, I was only visiting, I was not staying there. In saying this, a visit is a must-do whilst staying in Singapore even if it is just a visit to the huge plaza with its opulent canal through the centre or a trip up the super fast lift to the bar that looks over the infinity pool (only for guests use). It costs to do this but the cost can be redeemed for a drink at the bar - a nice touch whilst taking in the incredible views of Singapore, the Super Grove and the Flower & Cloud Domes.",4,
"Took a 3-night stay in Marina Bay. Since there's a Downtown Line for the MRT station, the Bayfront Station connect many routes to explore easily (also North South Line). Their view was very nice, I got the Garden of the Bays view through the balcony (With automated curtains).   Excellent service, they create an animal towel as a welcoming gift (or after makeup room). They're all polite and patient so if you need anything, don't hesitate to call them.  Their bed was amazing, I had an excellent sleep there. Inside the room, there were several tables with charging ports so you could charge many devices. The internet also available but you have to pay 20 SGD for hi-speed internet (Or otherwise, you'll use the free internet). The other way to connect the hi-speed internet for free is…",5,
Clean. Spacious. Connected to the Convention Center and a shopping mall. Close to the Science Museum. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Good first impression of Singapore. Lots of uniquely designed buildings. One of the first countries I've visited in a while that actively encourages people to drink the tap water. There is a notice at the hotel check-in counter that tells you that everything you say is recorded.,3,
"Very classy and beautiful room.  The buffet is among the best. The dinner buffet is SG$ 66 so it is expensive but there are so many choices to eat and the desserts are so tasty. The train downstairs makes it convenient to travel to other parts of the city.  The bathroom door does not have a lock and I wish they had a place to dry our swim clothes. The bathroom is beautiful, too bad I missed taking a photo of it.",5,
"Absolut perfect. Room, people, view, swiming pool, restaurants, all was perfect. The hotel services, locations and staff are awesome. Rooms very well... The wonderful thing is that you have direct access to Marina Garden by the Bay! MUST SEE / MUST VISIT!",5,
"I recently had 4 nights here (Premier Garden View room) and cannot think of a better hotel I’ve stayed at. One disclaimer: if you cannot tolerate large hotels, crowds, or queues (sometimes) then this probably is not the hotel for you.  Otherwise the hotel is amazing. The room was large and came with a balcony and great view of Gardens by the Bay. The bathroom itself was larger than some hotel rooms I’ve had and beautifully fitted out with plenty of marble surfaces. Soundproofing in the room is flawless: I am a light sleeper and never heard any noise from the corridor or neighbouring rooms the entire time. The infinity pool needs no additional mention (the photos speak for themselves).  Every staff member I dealt with was friendly, polite, helpful and caring. A number of staff I…",5,
"Having spent two weeks in Bali at some wonderful hotels, my wife and I stayed in Singapore for four nights and decided to treat ourselves to a one night stay at Marina Bay Sands, before moving on to Park Royal on Beach Road.  I would not seek to dissuade anyone from staying at Marina Bay Sands because it is probably a once in a lifetime experience for a lot of people at the exorbitant costs it charges. However, my wife and I left feeling somewhat disappointed by our experience of the entire place because it is not value for money. We had upgraded to a King Club Room. Without doubt, the views from the 49th floor are spectacular. The infinity pool and the views from the 57th floor are amazing. That is what you are paying for and the hotel owners know this. You certainly are not…",3,
"Stayed here for two nights before we continue our journey to Europe. The hotel services, locations and staff are awesome. Rooms very well appointed and clean.It’s a must to upgrade your bookings to the club room. The breakfast buffet is quite extensive. I will personally like to thank the staff at club55 so friendly and professional. I was amazed how they remembered my name considering my first time to stay at this hotel and only stayed for two nights. The only thing, I was a little bit disappointed is the infinity pool so crowded. I didn’t get the chance to relax and sunbathe as it’s always full. Though it has a spectacular photo-taking.  ",4,
"this hotel stay was worth every penny. we decided to splurge and get a room here after learning that the sky infinity pool was only accessible for hotel guests. but we truly enjoyed every minute spent at the marina bay sands. all the staff were so friendly and accommodating. there is so much to do around the hotel and so conveniently close to the gardens by the bay and the botanical gardens. the hotel has a mall, casino, museum and sky bar. it was a wonderful stay and highly recommend.",5,
"A very iconic building and great views of the sea. The staffs are very well trained and friendly. However, compare to the imposing building the lobby is more of a busy street bazar then an inviting place to relax; with too many restaurants and shops crowding the lobby and no decent place to sit.",3,
感謝 金沙酒店  帶給我爸媽這麼難忘的回憶❤️ 貼心準備了蛋糕還有床鋪的擺 以及頂樓的無邊際游泳池搭配夜景 一定會再回來 Thank you marinabaysands for giving my parents a memorable night on their birthday MarinaBaySands Singapore Taiwan #couple #parents #dad #mom #memorable #cake #birthday #mbs #infinitypool #thankful #love #family  ,5,
We could not recommend a better way to spend a day in Singapore 😍😍 @wandering_gizmo on instagram for all my pics xx The view from our balcony was amazing 😍  A bit expensive but well worth every penny ,5,
"We went for drinks, while visiting my brother in law who lives in Singapore, They made us feel welcome, I was slight undressed but they a made a plan, you feel like you on top of the world. I would love to experience the infinity pools they look amazing.",5,
"I have stayed many 5 star hotels all over the world and Marina Bay Sands is the worst among them.  I stayed one night with my girlfriend at Grand Club King room. We disappointed as following:  - Porters didn’t do their job: left one of our suitcases in the taxi we took, no baggage taking to reception.  - Early check in was not available even when we had arrived 30min to 3pm the check in time.  - VIP check in counter was not suitable for VIP: check in guests had to wait in line because only 3 receptionists available, kept us standing more than 15min because only 4 waiting sofas which were all occupied by other guests. Many Marina Bay Sands’ water pet bottles abandoned on the counter.  - Staff was not managed and trained, not only the porters I mentioned. One of staff members was…",1,
Nice place  Super staff  Super food quality  Class management  Extraordinary infinity swimming pool .. Rooms are awesome.. Stunning views Nice hospitality.. Mind blowing casino  Very big n many games in casino  ,5,
Manager got us an upgrade for the honeymoon~ suite was extremely nice. Honeymoon service was nice. Great experience~ the infinity pool was super nice~Everything was so nice~! I definitely recommend Marina Bay Sands,5,
"A short staycation with my family. Overall the stay are good, cleanliness and location are good. I stay on the 30 floor facing the sea view, is awesome especially for the sun rise and set set. As for the foods, is you prefer a more budget food, I will suggest to you take a trip down to Marina Square to have Your meal as it is more affordable.    If for tourist,  Mbs is a central location ,for all places of interest I.e orchard, suntec city, fort canning, Clark quay, boat quay etc.   Is my 2nd staycation over there. Looking forward for my next stay.",4,
"Beautiful hotel we stayed in an orchid suite which included breakfast at a number of restaurants as well as use of the club lounge. Veiws were stunning pool area was amazing and the club lounge provided an abundance of choice for the inclusive breakfast, afternoon tea & cocktail hour ( drinks provided and service was very generous). In general the resort was excellent however because the general public are permitted in the pool area (at a cost) it was always extremely busy therefore it was difficult to get a sun lounge and at times quite chaotic. Overall it was a very memorable stay definitely one for the bucket list.",5,
We recently stayed for 2 nights in an orchid suite with our 16 month old and had the absolute best stay! From the moment we arrived we were welcomed and made to feel so special. Not quite sure how others feel it’s not personal service - we found everyone knew our names and remembered us. It’s a huge hotel but lifts really don’t take long and for the most part I didn’t notice that it was a big hotel. Suite had a beautiful view and was huge. We loved the club lounge and particularly enjoyed breakfast there as well  as evening cocktails. I loved MBS and would love to go back! ,5,
"1N stay at the deluxe suite. Impeccable! The balcony is huge enough for a 10 pax celebration. The big bathroom is designed in such a way when one is showering, others can dip at the jacuzzi, shave, or take a dump all at the same time. The amenities provided are branded. The bedroom is ergonomically designed and comfortable. The living area is well-sized for a 20 pax movie. The sofa can also be converted into a bed, good for 2 children.  Minor issues though. 1. The coffee machine isn’t straightforward user-friendly one so a manual will be good. 2. The dining area is as big as the living. A larger dining table with more chairs will be great. 3. I doubt it’s the soundproofing because barely any noise coming from the expressway beside the hotel. Somehow I can hear ‘Canon In D’ being…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a wonderful place to stay in Singapore .The rooms are large , modern very comfortable and clean .Harbour view rooms have a fantastic view .The towers are connected by a pool on the 57 floor , pool is always busy we enjoyed s lots although expensive .",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands hotel looks impressive from a distance but to really get a sense of both the scale and magnificence of the property, you really need to get up close and personal. It's absolutely huge and quite unlike any other hotel in the world. An attraction in its own right!",5,
"If you go to Singapore you couldn't miss the Marina Bay Sands. It's impressive. We had a reservation  for the suite that was amazing, with a lot of services. The swimming pool at the top is a mix of dream and film. There are also a lot of good restaurant in the last floor.",5,
"Hotel staff were very accommodating.  We checked in particularly early, but they managed to provide us with one of our rooms.  We were able to use the pool late morning, which was a real advantage as it was much quieter then. It seemed to get busier as the day went on.  Clean towels are provided and there is waiter service at the poolside for drinks and snacks. We chose to relax in the adults area, which was a little quieter.   Observation area is well worth a visit.  I think the city looks particularly amazing at night, when the buildings are lit up.  The outdoor light show was a nice bonus too and worth a visit.  Our rooms were generous in size and the roll top bath was an unexpected surprise. Beds were amazing – I slept like a baby. Little touches like rose petals on the bed…",4,
"This is an expensive hotel. The single reason to stay here is the pool, if you don’t intend to use it there are better hotels.  The staff are very friendly and helpful; however; queues to check in rubbish, need more desks, even VIP queue appalling.  Room air con poor, we were on floor 43 so views spectacular.  Pool amazing , fabulous views but so much pouting for photos- look on and laugh.  We really enjoyed our short stay, however in pool until 11pm and back there at 6am.",4,
"This hotel is absolutely massive. Don't expect personal service or a warm welcome - there are just too many people checking in/ checking out/ attending events/ having a gawk. The roof top bars and pool are as amazing as the brochure, but BUSY. Everything is busy all the time - you queue for the elevator, for coffee, to check in or out, but somehow it all works. It's probably the best combination hotel for business, family, friends and honeymooners in Singapore - there is something for everyone, and a room type to suit everyone's needs though probably not everyone's pocket. It's a pricey place to stay, play and eat. Most, if not all, rooms have pretty spectacular views over the city or the ocean's edge or the botanical gardens and it's absolutely worth the money and effort to…",4,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay for 3 nights and had the Orchid suite on level 5 tower 2 facing the road. I would insist on a bay facing room. Even with special glazing, the road is busy and noisy at night. As we had booked a suite, and it was a lovely large bedroom, sitting area, dining room and one separate toilet as well as a full bathroom. With the suite you get the perk of afternoon tea which is a buffet and complimentary drinks every afternoon, including champagne & JD!  That was nice as you can watch the sun go down over the bay/city.  My only gripe was that the hotel is so vast. If we wanted to go to the pool, from our room, we would have to take a lift down to ground level, walk to other side of the tower and then get another lift to floor 55, then get out again and go up…",4,
"We stayed here for 1 night last 29th July for both leisure and business. Although it's a very short stay, this is not our first time visit and they always meet your expectations if not exceed it. I'm not sure if it's to all rooms but we are always welcomed with a cute puppy made of towels placed on the bed. Hotel associates are courteous from check-in, concierge, bellman, F&B and housekeeping. The hotel is always busy but their associates never forget to smile. Even security in the hotel is top notch. The telephone operators are helpful and very informative but for every call, they will ask for a survey/feedback that tends to get awkward and prolongs the conversation which could cause negatively especially if you're in a hurry. Their rooms are well kept even after being opened…",5,
"Marina Bay Sand provides one of the best city view in Singapore. However due to the hotel is so popular their famous eternity pool is always filled with people. The hotel rooms are spacious, with either the city or garden by the bay view. The down side of the hotel is that not all the lift can go directly to the viewing deck, as the hotel also sell tickets for people to go up to the viewing deck, it is difficult to find a good spot to take photo.",4,
"We arrived early in the morning and were able to check in to our room.  We had booked a family style room on the third floor.  It was a superb room for a family.  The arrangement of beds, furniture, bar, bathroom and television was well-thoughtout.  The outdoor patio was large and had a pretty very of the gardens.  It was very loud and close to the street.  So you wouldn't want to have your morning coffee on the patio.  The buffet line in very long and awkward.  So dining is not easy or comfortable.  The food is fine though expensive. The restaurant is situated in the center on the atrium.  This is a very loud area with hard surfaces.  There is not a good option for families with children.     They most important feature of the hotel is the world famous pool.  And that is a…",3,
"Beautiful hotel, in a beautiful location. It’s architecture is truly astounding three towers holding up the infinity pool, WOW.  Check in and out was fast and efficient with very polite staff. Rooms were beautiful and our dedicated staff member quick and polite when we called to have something sent to our room. Water bottles were left for us everyday al very nice touch because in Singapore you need to stay hydrated. Our room in tower three overlooked the Bay of Gardens and out to sea, breathtaking.  We were also very surprised to find a gift from the hotel in our room, hand towels with our surname embroidered on them,one for each guest,  that was a beautiful gesture from the hotel, so thank you.  We didnt take a breakfast package but did have breakfast in the restaurant one…",5,
"The hotel is very expensive but worth every penny. The views are spectacular and one can spend the entire day there, just hanging out. I would highly recommend it if one is in Singapore for the first time.",5,
"Seen this place on TV,so as we were in Singapore we would visit.Asked inside if we were able to go to the pool on the top and he said we could go up for free. So we did . We were not able to swim[not being guests of the hotel. So we had a drink and small snack which was quite expensive but it was worth it for the view and the setting. Worth a visit ",5,
"Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands started out poorly, but the management did a good job of providing a solution, so we ended up satisfied. I'm going to organize this review a little differentlly from most: what we liked, what we didn't, and lessons learned about MBS.  What we liked: 1. The views from the infinity pool and skypark are amazing.   2. The premier room was worth the upgrade. One of the problems we had was that we reserved and paid for a premier room, but we were given a deluxe room initially. So I experienced the difference - premier was a nicer room by far.  3. The room is made up daily with water and towel animals and other small touches.  4. The lifeguards enforce the adult-only pool and area. I appreciated this tremendously since so many places do not enforce…",4,
"not too much to say, the views at day and night over the town are simple fabulous, and so is the architecture. The large swimming pool is very busy, but you there is always a place for yourself.  We got an upgrade to a 330sqm Straits Suite at floor 53 from some very friendly japanese women at the reception and this was pure luxury",5,
"Room was good, food options are very expensive in the hotel and the drinks are a crazy price. The hotel was packed with tourists and clearly Marina Bay is a destination for leisure travellers. I wouldn't stay here for business purposes unless you are attending the adjacent convention centre (as i was) as it is not close to the business district, is expensive and is more geared to high end tourists. Cool pool though.",3,
"After a long flight we arrived at marina bay sands just after 4.30pm  no que at check in so was seen to straight away, only to be told our room needed paying for,  we told check it was already paid for in full on our package holiday we had booked, check in let us use there phone to contact the travel company who we booked with, our travel company tried to pay 3weeks before we went on holiday but marina bay sands would not process the payment until the day we arrived so travel company left there credit card on marina bay sands file for them to process upon our arrival, so as you can imagine this was very upsetting to arrive and  be told the room needed paying again, I paid again for our first night stay  just so we could sort ourselves out after a long flight after a while it got…",3,
"We checked in today and our experience has been totally subpar - we had to carry our bags from the taxi to our room ourselves, check-in took half an hour, we were ""upgraded"" to a city view room despite intentionally booking garden view to see the light show, and the pool was teeming with screaming children in the adults-only section. Not impressed, especially for this kind of money.",2,
"Spectacular in so many ways, the best infinity pool I've seen by far, the views of the city from the roof are something ill never forget. Amazing restaurants, staff and bars. Spent a night in the casino and i could have been back in Las Vegas but much more classy. all in all its expensive but that's Singapore for you regardless.",5,
"Still not really sure if it was worth the money. Room was a standard 5* - we had a family room which was nice and had a terrace, but I’ve stayed in better in Dubai. Breakfast was nice - but I’ve had better in KL. Pool was probably the only stunning thing that is unique... so was £450 for a night worth that pool? Probably not - probably better staying at the Sofitel or swishotel and getting something very similar for less money. Check in queue was horrendous - I complained and they gave us free breakfast which was really appreciated. Management was very kind and good.",4,
"We booked a room with breakfast at the 48th floor with city view. The room was big, luxurious, and clean. The infinity pool is great, and if you do't like the nuisance of children there is a special adults section. There is a lack of chairs at the pool. They serve lovely cocktails. For breakfast you have to be very early if you want to avoid the cue. We dined at a restaurant in the huge mall under the hotel. Don't miss the show Gardens by the Bay and the show Wonder Full at Marina Bay Sands.",4,
"This is the second time I've stayed here - infinity pool is still amazing as always. Try to head up early morning to avoid the crowds. Breakfast on roof top has a wide selection, reception service was great and rooms were up to standard. Very much enjoyed our stay.",4,
"You have to see it. The towers are connected by a pool on the 57 floor. And the pool is always busy, even at 6am! The rooms are very nice and it’s the only place in Singapore with a casino. Nothing compared to Vegas but I would give 5 Star for the ambience and the rooms. Quite expensive though. ",5,
"We were staying with a friend in Singapore, but he had family staying for the first couple of nights of our trip, so we needed to find a hotel.  We decided to book a couple of nights at Marina Bay Sands in a city view room so we could get to swim in the infinity pool.  Check in was straight forward and the room itself was spacious, very clean and a very comfortable bed.  The view over the city / marina from the room was great, but from the Skypark (Ce La Vi bar and Infinity Pool) are spectacular, especially at night.  There was easy access to the Gardens By the Bay (absolutely stunning) and transportation (buses & MTR), and plenty to see in the attached shopping mall.  We really enjoyed our stay, but given the cost for the rooms I would likely prefer to stay elsewhere on future…",4,
"What can one say about Marina Bay Sands? Such an impressive hotel in many ways. The infinity pool, wow! We were lucky enough to be there on the night of the 53rd birthday of Singapore so the view of the fireworks was great. The nightly sound and laser show, spectacular! The lobby and the shops alone are an amazing sight to see. Most shops were above our budget but surprisingly the gift shop had quality items for a very reasonable price, staff here were also very helpful and accommodating. The Sweetspot deli on the ground floor have tasty and affordable sandwiches and the array of sweets is to die for. Of course, location wise, couldn't ask for anything more. We were on the 7th floor of Tower 3 and looked straight at the Gardens of the Bay, no higher floor was needed to…",4,
"My family of 4 booked 2 club rooms facing the marina. The view from the 40th floor was amazing and we're able to catch the laser shows in the evening from the comfort of our room. The bed was firm and comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious, especially the shower. One of the biggest perks of staying at this hotel is the access to its famous infinity pool. Best time to get a picture with less people is to go early in the morning! Paying extra for the club room or suite is totally worth it: you have access to Club 55 almost all day, from breakfast to tea time (2-5 p.m.) and happy hours (5-7 p.m.). You get views of the marina and the gardens. Breakfast choices are good in Club 55, but if you prefer a larger variety of food selection, go to Rise restaurant on the first floor for…",5,
"Aside from the queue to check in the Hotel is great and certainly feels like 5 star, the staff are friendly enough but seem poorly trained. My wife has family who live in Singapore but have never visited the hotel and on check in tower 1 in we asked if her family could visit the pool and was told up to 3 guests are permitted in but  need to get guest passes at reception, later when they arrived we queues at Tower 3 reception for guest passes and was told they weren’t nessessary just go up, we took them up and were told yet another story at the entry gate that non hotel guests are not permitted at all, so we got 3 different responses from three members of staff. One more point, the room fridge stank of Durain.",4,
"Amazing view from the level 40 Club Room.  We saw the National Day fireworks, as well as enjoyed very efficient check in and customer care.  Food was great at Spago and we will definitely return next opportunity we get in Singapore!",5,
"You might have seen photos from this famous pool everywhere – it reigns pinterest and makes it to instagram’s popular page often. :Look at the view Oh my god, the view. Skyscrapers for miles and miles, with a pristine clear infinity pool in the foreground that stretched for hundreds of meters. It was incredible.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a great place to stay in Singapore. Right on Marina Bay is close to everything the city has to offer. The rooms are large, modern very comfortable and clean. Harbour view rooms have a fantastic view. Be warned thought the hotel is very crowded everyday. Check in can need a packed lunch. Register for VIP and the check in is much faster",4,
"In all honesty, we stayed in this hotel for the 'glam' pool-factor. However, we were surprised by the added bonuses. The hotel room was wonderfully generous in size and quality, with city views that were jaw-dropping. The greatest surprise was the volume of specialty shops attached to the hotel. The proximity to Marina Bay attractions was the 'icing on the cake'. A subway station is only a very short walk from the hotel lobby, facilitating connection with the bustle of Singapore. I will be back to stay; and not just for the pool!",5,
"This is our second trip to Singapore and we decided that staying in the Marina Bay Sands was a must this time.  We only booked one night, with regret I wished we had have stayed longer to get the full experience.  Check in is at 3pm, we had to wait until 4pm as our room was not available :( but they did let us use the Club Lounge as this was a part of the perk of our room.  The staff were so professional, they remembered our names and had that extra level of professionalism that you just don't see in many places. The view, well that's what your there for.  The beauty of the city from the highest building in that area is breath taking.  The lounge was very busy.  We eventually got into our room and were blown away, 31st floor with a fantastic view of the gardens by the bay. …",5,
"We arrived late at night to a super speedy check in....in fact I's say it was rushed. Room on the 10th floor was nice....what we'd expected really. Immediately went the top floor to see people everywhere. These are hotel guests and people who've paid to go to the viewing deck. The pool was really busy. We went to the restaurant but were told we would have to queue for 15 minutes until we could get in for a drink. Went to a really crowded bar, eventually got a drink and couldn't get a seat. The next day after looking around this amazing city we went back to a very crowded pool.  The following evening we went into the packed pool again. It is fabulous but always far too busy. Breakfast buffet had a good choice but again really busy, you have to queue outside for at least 10…",4,
"I booked a room in Marina Bay Sands as a surprise gift for my girlfriend just before we go back to our normal lives in Germany.  I also invited my sister to tag along with us.  We arrived around noon time and the check-in was supposed to start at 3pm. The front desk personnel, however, was very accomodating and kind enough to prepare our room for us and we were able to check in two hours earlier and went directly to the room(no extra charge). The luggages were delivered safely to our room as well as the extra bed for my sister. We decided to spend the time resting our tired feet. The view from our room was really breathtaking! (see attached image).   Another major advantage is the access to the Infinity Pool. We went swimming by sunset. There were a lot of people at first but…",5,
"We have been there with friends visiting Singapore many times, expensive drinks, no staff, no where to sit. Don’t go after 4pm, crowded and only 2 toilets!!!! Better places to spend your afternoon. Poor bar staff are run off their feet. Sack the F&B manager I say/",2,
"If we Talk about rooms, they were clean with nice frangrance. Hotel was nice and comfortable. Infinity pool is the best part in the hotel. Can enjoy your drinks and snacks besides pool. View was awesome from there. In the morning, breakfast buffet had too much variety of food to enjoy. Price wise, a little expensive. Otherwise all was good.",4,
"Our brilliant stay at Marina Bay Sands started with the fast and courteous service of Marcus. He obviously could see our party needed advice, and he was of immense help. We immediately felt at ease despite the huge crowds surrounding us. We arrived very early for check in, but Geraldine provided fast and efficient early check in service, as we wanted every millisecond in that amazing infinity pool. Avan also should be commended on his amazing service. He helped with our every enquiry re our luggage. I was very hesitant on staying here due to the negative reviews, but the 6 in our party recommend this resort as above par. We loved every minute spent here and eagerly await our return in the near future.",5,
"My partner and I recently visited for a 2 night stay. Firstly, I cannot fault the Hotel for check in procedure, cleanliness, amenities, sky deck etc.  However there were 2 instances where I have drawn issue. Firstly, we paid an awful lot of money for the club room experience. The room itself was wonderful but on the first night we returned to find the content of our toilet (and everything that had been in it) continuously over flowing into our bathroom. The smell was horndous! The issue was sorted quickly by the maintenance team. The following morning however the flusher broke resulting in us having to use the sky deck  toilets instead. This is not what I would expect from such an expensive room rate. When I emailed my feedback to the consierge it was ignored.  Next, the check…",2,
"For the cost of a room here I was expecting way more than I got. What I ended up with was an average room that had zero character. Apart from the view it could have been any hotel anywhere. Given the hype around this hotel my expectations where a lot higher, and there was nothing about the room that made me think it was money well spent. Avoid this hotel, there are way better options in Singapore with much more interesting decor that have way more character. It's not a hotel I would recommend to anyone and one I would never stay in again, as a luxury hotel it failed to capture and encapsulate the word ""luxury"". It is simply an overpriced average hotel and you are paying for the view and the location.",1,
"The lifts for each towers are often packed and on average takes about 6mins before you can actually reach your desired floor if you stay on the 40th storey and above, absolutely stifling in terms of air circulation or if someone is suffering from claustrophobia.  Too many rooms but too few amenities to really allow hotel guests to lounge around or spend their time over. MBS is just banging on the nearby GBTB and Shoppes to distract the crowd, but guests wants to do something that is really belonging to the hotel...  Magnificent architecture piece of work. View is stunning on both sides though. Definitely worth it.",3,
My family and my 3 kids stay for 1 night we want 2 nights but can't afford bcoz this hotel is expensive... The room is big but not as you expected for a luxury hotel its just average... But infinity is awesome... Panoramic view is priceless!!!,4,
"Just arrived back to England , spent 4 days at this amazing hotel, had a suite up on the 51st floor.

"飯店一切的設施，都令人讚嘆。但服務仍需加強。We lived in club room and use the afternoon tea service in club at 24/Jul. However, we feel we are neglected when we order wine service. We call waiter multiple times for wine, but the waiter are enjoying to chat with other guests by English and totally neglect us. Our official language is not English in my country (We come from Taiwan), is it the reason of neglect? If so, we will remember to speak English to the waiter to get better service. 雖然不是住高樓層，但我們在無邊際泳池度過一個快樂的下午，晚上去看了水舞秀及令人回味的濱海花園燈光秀，都是不錯的體驗。",4,
"The whole location, although very beautiful, seems like a rush job to create a massive landmark without the slightest thought toward organisation. Which is surprising of Singapore. Access is very restrictive from and to the MRT, where pedestrians get bottlenecked during busy times. There are not enough ways to cross the street safely, only a single overhead pass tunnel which again becomes overloaded at busy times. An accident waiting to happen!! ",3,
"We knew we had chosen a special hotel when we opened our room door, inserted the key into the slot and the curtains magically parted to reveal a view to die for.  Such a beautiful room,  such a perfect view, such lovely staff. Off up to the roof top infinity pool and again we were blown away. The wonderful staff were on hand to serve us with cocktails and snacks and helped us find 6 loungers so we could all sit together. Watching the light display from the Garden ""trees"" was lovely from our room. We were meeting friends for dinner so sadly didn't have an opportunity to eat in the hotel though we enjoyed taking tea the following morning in The Rise. Again the charming staff were delightful...always discretely checking we were fine. Would we go back...absolutely and we will. Can I…",5,
"Stayed here just one night in July. This is a really mighty building, and you can not stop looking at it from the ground, and you can not stop looking at the view from the top. We checked in early and had access to the Pool area even though our room wasn´t ready. Brilliant service! This hotel is so unique that you have to experience it. The room was really good with a small balcony facing Gardens by the Bay. The only bad thing i can imagine is, if the weather is really bad and you can´t use the pool area. Is it really the same experience?",5,
"We stayed on the 44th floor with great views of the gardens by the bay. Although busy check in was smooth.  Pros Great views. Attentive and polite staff. Great pool with more great views. Comfortable bed and pillows. Lovely smelling toilatries in room. Spacious bathroom. Convenient location with lots of food choices from world class restaurants to food courts.   Cons (With no fault of the hotel) Too many people at the Skypark. Lots of loud and rude mainland chinese tourist at the pool. They push you, kick you  with no apologies. My wife spent more time watching our pool lounges then soaking in the pool. They would sneak up to your chair, sit on it, remove your things and try to claim the spot. All under the watchful eyes of staff who were more concerned with kids dropping food…",5,
"We booked our Family room with breakfast for group of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids (14 yrs) for about USD$1,000 per night but were told the package only comes with 2 adults breakfast and does not cover the children, why (children don’t need to eat)?    I asked to purchase children breakfast to be included in our stay and then I was told since the children are 14yrs the hotel will charge them as adult rate about USD$50+taxes per adult for breakfast buffet.  Since children needs to eat so I accepted the charges.   I also asked if we can have our room on the higher floors for better view and then I was told all family rooms are located only on the lower levels (2&3 floors only) which was fine but then I soon find out our room was located on top of their Adrift restaurant with very loud…",1,
"My wife and I had spent two weeks prior to our stay moving through Thailand so to finish our trip we had a one night stay at Marina Bay Sands. As a hospitality major in college this hotel ticks all the boxes of what it means to run a hotel, resort, mall, club, pool, spa and the list goes on!   The whole place is HUGE and it runs like a well-oiled machine, not a thing was out of place. My wife and I loved it so much we extended another night and the front desk made it happen without moving rooms.   If you aren't staying here at least make it to the pool, WHAT A VIEW! Thank you for the great experience and we will be back!",5,
"This hotel was on my list of to do's.  It is very majestic.  The comfort, the attention, the view.  Make sure you know that the environment is very pricy.  This was a special treat at the end of a trip.  Worth it, but will not be going back.  Would like to see other aspect of Singapore.",4,
First: the rooftop is outstanding and the view spectacular!  The hotel services are far away from a 5 star level - from check in to check out very poor! You dont need to book a room for the pool... you would feel like a koi in an overfilled pond.  Worst experience: after 5 days and two emails later still no check out bill of the « very fast » express check out and something like 400 USD still blocked! A very american experience... for the same money you can get a real 5 star palace experience in Sungapore.,2,
"This is something you want to tick the box on your bucket list, because it is such a landmark in Singapore. But to be honest, I have had much better experiences where it comes to service and customer friendliness and obsession. It is all very commercial, very crowded and once you checked out, all access is blocked to any floor including the pool. There is no space at all to sit to wait for when you have to leave. In our case, we had the KLM flight just after midnight, we couldnt get or buy a late check-out, so had to levae the room at 1pm, and nowhere to sit or stay in the meantime. We could store our Luggage, and briefly use the gym to change into our travel clothes. The family room is very big, and we stayed there with our 2 sons of 14 and 17, which fits easily. A huge room,…",3,
"Everything about Marina Bay Sands is huge,  starting with the queue at check In and continuing through all aspects of the monster lobby, three towers comprising a total of more than 2500 rooms,  the unique SkyPark and the extensive retail mall.   The hotel is impressive,  but more in terms of quantity rather than quality.  So many restaurants,  so many shops and so so so many people.  And so many $ when it comes to paying the bill.   Staying in a hotel of this size and complexity is an experience of a lifetime and given the scale of the place it would be less than reasonable to expect five star quality throughout.  It doesn’t deliver five star quality,  although failures are largely of the minor irritation variety eg the room safe shouldn’t need batteries and one of the two…",4,
"Good experience had - nice property, well architected, spacious rooms, good amenities, relatively current fixtures, good WiFi (though $20 per night for high speed?), nice buffet breakfast but pricey. Felt roomy, but perhaps a little soul-less (could be because it's next to a casino). The upstairs pool and bar is world class nice.",4,
"Plus: Beautiful hotel, world-class. Magnificent view from the infinity pool over-looking the Singapore skyline. Easy access to shopping centers and the Gardens by the Bay. Negatives: Too pricy, overrated accommodation. Much chlorinated water in infinity pool due to overcrowding. It’s a standing pool, and not a swimming pool. During thunderstorms, pool closes so you will lose pool access. Expensive restaurants.",4,
"First class service, suite, food, leisure, location, worth every star!! Marina Bay Sands was by far the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. I love traveling but always dread the aweful beds at some hotels, either the pillows kill your neck or the beds your back, this bed was a dream. Luxuary all round. I could not fault this hotel on ANYTHING. Beautiful pool side over looking the city, large enough to not get over crowded, the bars are great and so are the restaurants, breakfast selection was FANTASTIC and everything you need in close proximity. OH of course I just had to have the body pamper, it had the best spa, pure decadence, a full body massage here is A MUST if that’s your thing, I just simply Loved, loved, loved this place!",5,
"Located perfectly at Marina Bay, full of restaurants. Also well connected to train station, makes entire journey so easy! Love their concept which everything under one roof. You can get everything here, as they have shopping center, restaurants, Garden by the Bay and so much more. Don’t forget he rooftop infinite pool, which is world famous!",5,
"A pleasure of mind and body. Marina Bay Sands is the extreme pleasure you can get while on a beautiful city like Singapore. An infinity pool unique and magnificent. I spent there just one night with my family but I enjoyed every little moment inside the hotel, room where big and clean. The service helpful and ready to give the best treatment. Personally I think that you should just try it, also with a low budget, it's a remarkable experience that you will never forget.",5,
"The hotel is in itself an icon of Singapore. The panoramic view from the infinity pool is reallu unique, although the pool area turns too crowded at specific hours. Rooms are very confortable. Decoration and common spaces confirm the 5 star rating. Variety of restaurants and bars is impressive. ",5,
"If you want look on Singapore from bird perspective you vcan use Sands SkyPark Observatory deck on 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands hotel, really good view - unfortunately restaurant is available only for hotel guests.. :(",4,
"Stayed for 3 nights on 37th floor with a garden view. Large spacious room with a nice large bathroom and walk in shower. Nice firm king size bed. Certainly didn’t hear any traffic noise on this side of the building as others mentioned.  It is a big hotel with 3 towers and large public/reception areas. Many locals and tourists come to visit and go up to the 57th floor for the spectacular views so the hotel is always crowded and busy. This includes bars, restaurants, pool area. This does spoil the whole ambience. ",4,
What a wonderful  hotel.  The design come from the future. The infinite pool at the top of the roof must be tried. You have to swim seeing the skyscrapers.    The restaurant in the hotel are more beautiful but more expensive.,5,
"Recently returned from 4 night, 5 day family trip to Singapore.  MBS hotel was my home for short while.  I was lucky enough to experience VIP check-in and premium room stay in this fine establishment. On this level, check in was pleasant breeze with offered refreshments.  I must mention that I have seen rather long lines on main check-in desk.  Our room was located on level 11 overlooking gardens and stuffed with amenities. Shower/bath tub area is neat solution. Water pressure and temperature all worked great.  Plenty of activities, shops, restaurants all within walking distance from main lobby. Notably, there is easy walking access to Gardens that have so much to offer.  Rooftop pool was expectantly busy with people walking in pool carrying their PEDs.. I have personally found…",5,
"We stayed in an orchid suite with club 55 access.  Club 55 breakfast food and view was amazing!  Gym is small but well-equipped. View from room was great.  Orchid suite layout was good for accommodating the 3 of us who were recovering differently from  jet lag.  It's a huge property but it almost never felt crowded to us.  The room was very clean and our helper must have been very excited to fashion animals out of towels to entertain our daughter.  To improve: Adrift restaurant at dinner - too loud. We had to abandon our reserved table and go eat at a random place in the shopping center so we could have a conversation.  Rise restaurant at breakfast - super crowded, felt more like a Vegas buffet.  Check-in - we walked into the lobby for suite check-in and were told to sit and…",5,
"We celebrated our stay in Singapore with a touch of luxury’s by staying at Marina Bay Sands. We enjoyed the club bonus which gave us the privilege of breakfast, snacks and drinks during the day and evening. Close to the gardens. Spacious room. As for the pool simply amazing. Definitely should be on your must do list.",5,
"This hotel is pretty famous for its’ rooftop facility, infinity pool, but the hotel room is consider normal. I would assume the hotel want their hotel guess to enjoy their facility such as swimming pool, shopping center, museum, and casino other than staying at the room for the most time. So if anyone plan on staying at the hotel, be sure to check out their membership reward card (mostly for dinning and shopping). The membership reward card can also be used for discounted ticket price for the ArtScience Museum.",4,
I can now reaasure that this hotel s now tick in bucket list. The infinity pool was the draw card of why we choose Marina. The place is an iconic of Singapore and the view from the hotel is breathtaking. The morning buffet both upstairs and the ground floor is a must to try. The housekeeping service was excellent. The room itself was great and spacious and to top it off is the view to the city. Highly reccomends this hotel to anyone travelling to Singapore.,5,
"We stayed here in July with 2 children and they loved the view and the pool. This hotel is in a great location. lovely coffee shop in the lobby and Starbucks in the mall across the road. I would use these rather than having the breakfast which I thought was too expensive for what it was.  only other comment I would make is that on check in our room wasn't ready but a more expensive one was...we decided to wait and somebody said they would call us when it was...but this call never came and we had to go back a few times to reception. not ideal qdtwr a 13 hour flight with small children. I wouldn't have mentioned it had we not heard numerous people saying they had been told the same thing. Is it just to get people to upgrade?? if so, don't worry about the view from your room, just…",5,
"Beautiful to look at and rooms were excellent. We only took breakfast as we wanted to try local cuisine. Breakfast was mainly buffet but you could order as well. Service was top class both quick and friendly. The only con was this hotel is open to non staying guests, so for a small fee you could access all the restaurants and amenities so breakfast was very crowed and the pool at the top was standing room only! If we were to return we would stay elsewhere.",4,
The hotel itself is very beautiful with outstanding views of the city or alternatively of the Gardens. I had the Garden view and each night the light show at 8:00PM was a real treat to watch. The 57th floor infinity pool is something to see although it was jam packed with kids. They need to designate one of the sections as adult only. The lobby is active 24/7 and a little to big to feel very comfortable for me.  Great fitness facilites.,4,
Such an incredible wonderful place . So clean . Beyond expectations. Close to many area around . But as much as place is beating around u wouldn’t stay less than a week . Staff very helpful and polite . Just amazing,5,
"Everything was perfect. The view to the Gardens by the bay, service, breakfast, facilities, the pool. Nothing to mention as negative. So grateful for the memories! Kids loved it as well. Would love to be back. ",5,
Stayed there for 2 nights and felt very ignored. The hotel is too big to have anyone recognise you. Very crowded and busy. We asked for towels and it took more than 45 mins to deliver. Well granted the busy days but still lack of attentiveness. Can be better...,3,
"Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands was really pleasant and would definitely recommend the club lounge. The breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and canapés were exceptional.  The room was spacious, clean and very well appointed.  Small criticism was that even in the 46th floor, you could hear the  traffic from the road below.  Amazing views, comfortable bed and loved the USB ports along side all power outlets which were great for charging everything.  The only negative is just how busy the hotel is.  Check in was a very long process and a little frustrating.  The staff were under pressure and really there should have been more staff on during peak times (especially on the weekends)  The pool does look beautiful but again, it's just too busy to really relax or find any…",4,
"Beautiful views either City or Garden.  Look totally different in day or night. Stays was simply fantastic. Friendly and helpful staff all time round without any issue at all. Shopping is so easy without even using google if you are a tourist.  Fantastic SKYline view without any doubts. Not a casino fan so never bother to step in.  If you are feeling rich, it is a MUST to stay and enjoy yourself to the fullest....",4,
"I’m attending a conference at the Marina Bay Sands convention center and checked in at their hotel. The view is amazing. The room was big and nice. Very spacious. Location is perfect, there’s an MRT station right under.",5,
"We stayed MBS when we've been to Singapore on business. We are overwhelmed by very big and peculiar this building. The famous pool on the roof is very cool. The view from the rooftop makes us very excited. Breakfast is so good, and we can enjoy the casino nearby.   我們被這座非常大而奇特的建築所震撼。屋頂上著名的游泳池非常涼爽。早餐很好。  仕事でシンガポールに行った時に泊まりました。建物が大きく特徴的なので圧倒されます。話題の屋上プールは最高で、景色も感動します。朝食もおいしいし、近くにカジノがあって楽しめます。",5,
"We stayed here for 2 nights after a long flight from the UK. The hotel's air conditioning was a welcome break from the humidity! The complex itself is very large, split into 3 towers with lots of shops/restaurants/food courts in the wider shopping area. Upon arrival, the check in for our tower was shut, so had to go to the tower 1 reception. Check in was easy and you can have people help with luggage if required. Rooms seem to always have either a great view of the city or the gardens, so no worries there!  The pool area is also lovely and you can access it with your card. Towels are provided to you upon entry, and you can spend as much time as you want here, with drinks being brought to your lounger. It's noticeably quieter in the morning, so advise coming then for a more…",5,
"4 days for work.  Fantastic room, good aircon, clean and four towels! (Not two).  The infinity pool in the most instagrammed location on the planet!  And so it should be, cool space.  Like a lot of large hotels, it’s busy and perhaps lacks a little soul.  Is also expensive.  Happy to return.  No complaints and issues.",5,
"We stayed two nights in Singapore, thought we would treat ourselves to a night in this plush hotel.  We arrived and it was like the arrival terminal at the international airport, you don’t get any personal service in a place that you pay moon beams for.  The rooms were average to say the least, the hotel staff were average also.  The so called infinity pool was like bathing in a spa with 1000 others.  The hotel lacks a lot of maintenance it’s noticeable all around, if they used the money they charge on up keep then you can get value for money..  not worth a return visit me thinks...",2,
"For sure it’s a place to visit. Fantastic swimming pool area and beautiful sky park ! We really enjoyed the visit of all Marina Bay Area. About the rooms I should say are not up to expectations,details are not cured as should be in an hotel with such prices ",4,
"Looking to relax? This hotel would be too crowded and can give one a headache unless you hibernate in the room. The lobby is not the private lobbies you tend to experience as with other hotels. It's like getting to a tourist class hotel, crowded and intermingled totally with the public. Rooms are nice and nice befitting the stars but once you get out of the room to the lobby, all hell breaks loose. Accessibility to the convention centre and casino is easy, albeit bit of a walk as it's a large complex. Apart from the much touted infinity pool, the hotel is pretty much businesslike atmosphere, definitely not for those looking to unwind. Infinity pool is usually crowded and if you are looking for a swimming workout, forget it. It is teemed with 'swimmers' posing for that selfie…",2,
"My husband, two teenagers and I spent one night in Club Grand Rooms (between moving from another hotel and before heading to Sentosa). These luxurious rooms have the feel of a suite. They are situated at the end of the floor (the corner) so you get a remarkable view over the Marina Bay on one side and direct view of Gardens By the Bay from the bathroom. They are amazingly positioned for both the Marina light show and then the Super Tree light show a short while later. They only have one of these rooms on each floor so my family were split between two floors but that was no issue. The rooms were incredibly comfortable with every item you could ever need. Nothing quite prepares you for the impact of seeing the swimming pool for the first time - its really breathtaking. Our…",5,
"It was an amazing treat to be able to stay at this Singaporean landmark for a whole week while accompanying my husband on a business trip.   We got upgraded and had a huge room on the 54th floor with fantastic views. Unfortunately, it smelled badly of cigarette smoke, and we were able to get a new room on the 50th floor; smaller but not stinky.  The bathroom and products were great. We had bathrobes and slippers, plus got free water bottles every day; which matters when everything has Las Vegas pricing.  The top of the hotel has the famous infinity pool which is an experience, for sure. The views are incredible. There was a light breeze up there, palm trees that one can find shade under, and hot tubs.  During the day, it was quite busy in the pool. I've seen pictures that show…",4,
"Stayed at MBS 6 nights for business and conference.  Pros: super convenient for convention center, transit stop, shopping mall and casino.  Hotel itself was crowded, but considering 2,500 rooms most of our experience went smoothly. Room was standard fare: clean, comfortable, timely service, etc.  garden view was nice, especially at night.  Helpful staff throughout.   Cons: Check-in was slow.  Everything was just more expensive, so venturing away for food/drink at times was needed to feel satisfied.   The rooftop park experience was amazing.  Winning at the casino allowed us to splurge on a lavish dinner up there at LAVO, which is a pricey Italian restaurant that delivers quality for a price.  We will definitely consider staying here next time due to the convenience and…",4,
"Stayed with my family in July, Great hotel with good location.  Taxis were easily available outside the hotel which was helpful. The room was amazing, large beds, bright and very modern with city view and all the amenities and a beautiful view of gardens by the bay.  Club 55 was fantastic and staff was lovely. Kids had a lovely time at the breath taking infinity the pool.  It was a lovely experience to stay at Marina Bay Sands. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Shopping complex attached to the hotel is a huge plus point. The light shows and garden shows were simply superb!!                             Thanks Marina Bay Sands for an amazing stay.",5,
"Although the hotel has a fantastic view and a friendly staff it did´t meet our expectations. You had to wait in line for breakfast, the infinity pool was so crowded (all opening ours) that you never had the infinity-feeling and on top of that somebody had been smoking in our room. Even though the staff efficiently helped out on this issue it did´t change our overall impression of a hotel that is oversold.",3,
In one word: awesome!! For sure it’s an huge hotel with a tons of people in there as well as at the infinity pool but it’s worth to be there at least for one night and you will not regret it! Not cheap but service was good and we enjoyed a drink at night at the poolbar on which they serve excellent cocktails!  ,5,
"The architecture of the hotel is what is most appealing. The skypool at the terrace is the most beautiful place of this hotel. You can have some very nice views of Singapore from this place. Once a visit is enough, nothing much special here.",3,
"For the price, the room wasn’t spectacular. I think one is paying for the access to the infinity pool. Pool is nice but quite crowded with ppl. Night time at the pool is better. Staff was efficient and friendly. Room was fairly comfy and we had a view of the gardens by the bay so that was nice.",3,
"The hotel is spectacular, of course. But we think it's a bit over rated despite the stunning views and spectacular design. It's in fact far to big. We booked a club room for one night and the room was great, big and clean with a beautiful view. The staff in the reception was very helpful and we got an early check in with any extra charge.The club room also gave you access to the club lounge, which we expected to ba calm and quiet. On the opposite, it was crowded and noisy with long lines even to get in there! The pool deck on the roof were amazing, and even so it was crowded, there were sun beds for everyone. The staff were very observant, helpful and worked hard for all guests! We believe one night was a must to see and experience this spectacular hotel, but one night was…",4,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 4 nights in a suite. The suite was quite large for a couple. We had our own living room and the bedroom had a fantastic view to the city of Singapore. The bathroom was big and clean. Everything in our room was perfect for a luxury-feeling and I loved my room with the view.  The breakfast and the including lunch-time was really good and the staff was lovely and service-minded.   But other else than this, I did not quite like that the feeling to ""go through a shopping mall"" to get to your room. The elevator was crowded with many people and unfortunately I do not have the patient to wait for an elevator to get to my room with many people...",4,
Great great great location. Our specious room has a view of the bay. Very modernization property with superior services. Great high end shopping and attractions within walking distance. The 57th floor infinity pool with amazing city view is a must to visit. The breakfast restaurant on 57th floor is also our favorite.,5,
Best hotel ever! We got a free upgrade just because it was our first time in Singapore. We won ton of money at the casino that it re-paid the whole week of stay. Worth every penny to get to bathe in their pool and enjoy the view. ,5,
Of course I just visited it because I can’t book such magnificent but very expensive hotel. 3 huge tour buildings of super designed architecture. The three tours r top connected by a boat like roof with a huge infinity pool u can ever see.,5,
"Stayed here for one night as a stopover between India and Malaysia. Definitely one of my favourite hotels. I arrived early (9am) and was just looking to leave my bags till check-in. Luckily they were able to check me in and give me a room right away. This was much appreciated as I had flown all night and could definitely use a shower. The room itself was incredible and washroom facilities were perfect. Everything was clean and well taken care of, and the perks of staying here was the access to the infinity pool which had spectacular views of the city. Will definitely be back in the future.",5,
"Nothing i can say but excellent  For the past few years, everytime i go to Singapore, this is the place i stay. It likes second home for me. The room is huge, super clean, and all the sfaff all the workers are very friendly and ready to help you anytime you need. The location is also convenient, very close to MRT, and lots of stores inside the building hotel. Dont forget to dine inside the casino The best 👍 with reasonable price ",5,
"Nothing to fault. Check in experience was simply great. rooms, beds were comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Bell team was efficient with great smiles, do not know if I got his name correctly, John. Thank you for a wonderful stay..",5,
"Well, you can't be in Singapore and miss this hotel! I think it is the most photographed hotel in the world. The experience is splendid and even is pretty expensive it its worth it. The roof pool offers a splendid view over the city and you can find here probably the best tasting cocktails you ever dreamed of. Watch out for the room refrigerator! If you move any bottle it will be marked on the desk as consumed and will appear on your bill - you have some minutes to put it back, so read quickly the label of the ultra-expensive champagne and avoid to be charged :))",5,
"We arrived at the Marina Bay Sands around 7:30am.  The bell staff was quick to help with our luggage.  There was a line for check-in, which took about 20 minutes.  The beginning was slow, but as time progressed, additional staff showed up to work and toward the end, the line sped up.  The person who checked me in was friendly and courteous.  We were in our room by 8:00am on the 47th Floor in tower one, over looking the city.   The room was a good size, with a king bed and a pull out sofa, which they offered to help us open up. The amenities provided are good, complimentary waters every day, universal outlets - so converters are not needed, multiple usb outlets are provided in the rooms. The fridge in the room is for the minibar only, there is a charge if you want a fridge. …",4,
"Really great experience- go for it (with full pockets) haha. The pool was the drawing point for us and it did exceed our expectations. So many great bars,  restaurants and shopping but expect to pay alot for everything (like $18-$20 for a beer). Went to lavo for dinner which was lovely Italian with a great view on the 57th floor.  They do need to have more staff to help with bags and check in/ out ect. You do expect the little things when you are paying such a premium.  It would be nice to be greeted better on arrival.  ",5,
"Even though the hotel is huge - it comprises 3 towers - the attention to detail and the level of service is a cut above all other hotels in Singapore.  The staff are well trained and deal with all hotel guests in a pleasant, courteous and warm manner.  The only other place where I have encountered such great service and attention to details in on Singapore Airlines First Class and Business Class. The suite that we stayed in was well appointed and very tastefully furnished. The view of the Singapore Straits and Gardens by the Bay was stunning especially at night. The infinity pool was ..... out of the world.",5,
"If you're doubting staying at this hotel because of the price....DONT...worth every penny. The hotel is beautiful, surrounded by shops/restaurants, near a hawcker center, walking distance to Gardens by the Bay, and the customer service is OUTSTANDING! oh and the pool.........",5,
"We stayed here for two nights as a start for our Bali trip. There are several check-ins at the ground floor, but we were not aware of that and therefore we just qued to check-in at the main entrance. Better to look if the other desks are qiucker. The rooms are nice and spacious. Of course the swimming pool is stunning. We had dinner at the roof top and at the reservation I had mentioned that we were there for a special occasion; my wifes birthday. Unfortunately I had to remember them at the desert. Than they came with a nice gesture.  Please be aware that if you pay by creditcard they take the amount and on top of that they reserve the same amount on your card for another two weeks. We therefore started our Bali trip with one creditcard blocked for about $ 3000,-. Conclusion:…",4,
"I'll try to make it simple and fast...I arrived at 11am and dropped my luggage with them and went for a city tour since our room wasn't ready till 3pm. When I came back and went to pick my luggage the guy just gave my luggage without offering any help!!! I had to walk from tower 1 all way down to tower 3 passing thru a number of hotel employees carrying 2 big luggages plus 2 bags and no one bothered to ask me if I needed help!!! The room is just a regular room but with an amazing view and that what makes it interesting many reviews are about the view,the swimming pool or the sky park so they only got 5 stars because of their location/facilities? For me the shower water wasn't hot enough and the pressure was off but that is just me. I guess the hotel is just too big for them to…",2,
"Stayed here with my family for 5 for five nights. This is an unbelievable property - offered excellent service. Its a huge hotel with 1500 rooms, that are mostly occupied. You could imagine how busy this lobby is, pretty much all the time. We loved it.  Tried various breakfast buffets and we liked RISE the best. Needless to say, the top floor pool is the best of the best. This is a very safe hotel for all.  We would love to go back to stay here... and strongly recommend you to try. Of course, its costly, but its definitely worth your money.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most visited for the Casino, Skypark and the building itself. It is an expensive hotel however you can visit the hotel, the casino and the grounds. its a really beautiful place and you will find yourself here before you go to the Gardens by the bay.",5,
The place is really fantastic. You can view whole Singapore and it's beauty. I was there on a family visit and they enjoyed a lot in Singapore. The sight from Marina Bay Sands should not be missed by any one who visits Singapore.,5,
"The reason for choosing this hotel is the pool and the pool is super.They could have had thick mattresses on the sunbeds and it would be even better. Also really nice/smart to have a adults only part of the pool. They could have had the pool open even longer in the evening. A few things that was a drawback at this hotel. It was big and feel like a machine and you always feel they want to charge for every little thing. They give you complementary water, but they don't have any space for you to cool your water in the mini bar without changing you. Nice room with a nice balcony. But for the price you pay other hotels have nicer rooms. But the pool is only at this hotel.",4,
"While there are more luxurious hotels in the area that provide better service, this hotel has the best views and is otherwise a tourist destination for its SkyPark and other areas. I only give it 4 stars as a hotel, as it is more of a tourist destination than a quality hotel. They also have potentially long waits, as the check in/check out staff is incredibly helpful, but that makes them slow, if there is no one available, and they do not call for more support.",4,
"Marina Bay Sands, 5 Star Hotel . The hotel ambiance feels like it. Sky Observation is deck is free when you checked in this hotel. Access to Infinity pool as well as Banyan Gym. I didn’t bother going to the gym for we spent 4 hours at the infinity pool. The food at the pool side is on the high end, slightly bigger size cheese burger with a lot of French Fries on the side . It was a week day so we were not able to experience other free shows but we were able to see Spectra ( light and  water fountain show) shown at 8 and 9 pm respectively. The Mall connected to this hotel is humongous. A day might not be enough if you are a shopper. Our room was Garden view overlooking the Gardens by the bay.

"The hotel is indisputable the biggest attraction of Singapore, which can become dull quite quickly. The hotel is enormous, in every way. The lobby feels like the main station of New York, its constantly full of people and quite loud. The check-in took forever, at least 40 minutes which was really not pleasant. But the staff is very friendly and helpful.  We had a very nice large room on the 43rd floor, very clean and generous with a lovely few on the harbor. The room maid was a total towel wizard! Every day we found a new animal on our bed :-) Really charming. There is very little cupboard space and it had a weird smell, probably because of the humidity.   The spa is lovely, my husband booked several massages in the Banyon Tree Spa, and he was very happy with it! Ok the pool -…",4,
This hotel is pretty much a high-end Vegas hotel in the middle of Singapore.  Too big and bustling for my taste but I was impressed by the room.  It was large and very comfortable with all the amenities.  I think the main reason to stay here is the views.  Not sure if that alone is worth the price of the room - but the hotel aims to please.  The staff was professional and courteous (even if I was awakened at 3am by a phone call from the reception telling me a document that I had sent to print earlier in the evening was ready?!).,4,
The best rooms are the Club rooms with City Views - watch the day turn to night - a great experience. The infinity pool and the Club Bar - great and good value! The booking in with te club rooms is a VIP booking service and much faster than the normal,5,
All I can say is wow! It would take you days to explore the entire thing and we only had one night but it was amazing! Stayed for our 10 year wedding anniversary while visiting family in Singapore. The food was spectacular (we ate at Ce La Vie) and the view from the pool/Restaurant are some of the best ever. The pool! Best pool I’ve ever been in hands down. The only way to swim in it is if you stay here. Stay on the certain floors to enjoy club 55. You get free breakfast with this option and it’s so good! Also free wine and tea at certain times. This place is truly something to be seen!,5,
"We had trouble finding the entrance for the observation deck but had a good laugh while doing so, walking though the shopping mall, a lady from the hotel got a shock when she got out of the lift on the wrong floor in her swimwear oops. Anyway when we got to the entrance to take us to the observation deck the views were spectacular and the light show in the bay was fabulous. Well worth the money.",4,
"In my first trip to Singapore I asked friends where to stay and this was one of top recommendations so gave it a try. Yes it’s pricey - but worth the experience at least once. The deluxe room was nice enough, though while you’re at it you might want to splurge for premium and club access. I got a garden view and asked for a higher floor - ended up on 17th floor and enjoyed the view of the super grove and bay. Garden view room had a huge balcony which was great for morning coffee, evening views. Room comes with tea kettle and tea/coffee, two complimentary bottles of water.   Other notes on hotel: - it is great having free access to the pool and Skypark. Skypark views at night are phenomenal. Go up, enjoy a super expensive, yet super delicious drink (Spago bartender was great) and…",4,
"My Mrs and me were celebrating our anniversary recently at Marina Bay Sands and had a great night as usual at your establishments..When we decided to head home,an unfortunate incident occured while we were taking the lift down,an intoxicated man happened to be in the lift down with us as well and was mumbering complains to why we had to take the same lift with him..I  beckoned to him to keep quiet  and leave us alone and a scruffle broke out as he tried to assault me .Thankfully there were other guest in the lift down who lend a helping hand to stop him as I am much smaller size.On alighting from the lift,I was so angry but thankfully the MBS security had noticed and came to my assisitance..The security staff was very nice and kind enough to tell me to just not bother about him…",5,
"We stayed 7 nights in this beautiful hotel.The staff is very polite and attentive .The service is very good.The infinity pool is amazing on the top and the view is spectacular but the security in the evening can be a bit heavy handed and not so polite ( ie crossing from the skydeck to the restaurant ).Also,considering it is a 5 star hotel , we had a towel in the bathroom with big holes in it and dusty shelves. I don't think it is acceptable.The air con in the room is noisy .Overall , it is a well located hotel with a lots to do within walking distance .",4,
"We visited Marina Bay Sands hotel in September 2017 and loved it. The rooms are beautiful, the staff is friendly and the rooftop infinity pool is amazing !! The pool service was also good! The pool was a bit crowded though. The Wolfgang Puck restaurant by the rooftop pool was incredible. Highly recommend this hotel !!",5,
"The hotel is great, and the club rooms have their own sitting area. The access to Club55 was great, and moreover the service was incredible, with housekeeping cleaning the rooms atleast thrice a day. However, the hotel is a little crowded, and it seems like an airport with people walking in crowds. Moreover, the security at the Inifinity Pool is a little too much and guests require to scan their key card each time they enter or leave. The Shoppes are also great, and the hotel offers a wide range of luxury brands. The hotel also has its own MRT station (Bayfront), and all the public transport is very well connected to the hotel.",4,
"An architectural iconic building, with infinity swimming pool on the top (57th floor). The view is magnificent, either side, river front facing the city skyline and or harbour front.The hotel has nearby access to the Garden by the Bay,a must sea collection of orchids .It is also having a big shopping mall,with a casino and the underground Metro station",5,
The hotel is stunning! Great views from the top infinity pool or restaurant.   The staff is very well trained and very attentive.   Is nice to experience all that at least once in a while!   We did enjoyed ourselves! ,5,
"One of the worst hotel experience. Due to access of outsiders it creates a problem for the hotel guests. Not worth it, im never coming back here. Im probably gonna try a more professional hotel, where they do care about their guests. Its better if they would start paying attention to their own hotel guests rather the ones from outside. Im really embarrassed, came with my wife.😕😕 They couldnt arrange a table for us, were sent rudely back. ",1,
"Stayed 1 night with family in a Premier twin room Garden view. Our balcony had the view of Gardens by the Bay and could watch the show of lights from there. The view was captivating. Service was good despite the fact that we had to wait in line during check in and check out. They offered water upon check in. Considering the price of all rooms in this hotel, we expected juice or cocktails at least (even for non-suite guests). We paid S $610 for a night. Check out was not easy.  We had to wait long but was later accommodated in the lounge. No express check out like most hotels in Europe.   The beds were comfortable. Twin rooms (with 2 beds) had small single beds only. Unlike other twin rooms in other asian countries like Philippines for example, a twin room would have 2 large…",5,
Let me start off by saying I’m glad we stayed here but for us once was enough. We have now seen this hotel. Swam in the pool been there done that and we wouldn’t come back. Nothing against the hotel. The hotel is lovely but it is just far too busy. In saying that the hotel does have great systems in place if you look at the staff and they way they work managing the crowds of not only guests but people who just come to the hotel for a look.  Check in was overwhelming with swarms of people arriving at the same time. There are three towers and so there are different check In locations. If you are in tower 3 for example I recommend getting your driver to pull in to the tower three entrance for example to save you the walk between. It’s not huge but it is long and when doing it…,4,
"This hotel is huge and exclusive. Our room was big and clean with amazing view to the city. Nothing to complain.   The infinity pool is a must see, though it’s crowded and therefore quite dirty. They have towels at the pool and you can change them for free when needed. There are also hot tubes at the rooftop where you can watch the light show of Gardens by the Bay.",5,
"It's worth if you stay there! enjoy the city at night from their infinity pool gives you more experiences. Singapore city i thought it's humid and lit bit hot all day, not windy so don't worry if swim at night lol",3,
"If you choose to stay in this resort, you make sure to bring some u forgettable memories home. Yes, I'm talking about the infinity pool. We got the Orchid suite on 52nd floor with breathtaking views over the bay. The pool is on the 57th. Even if well overcrowded mostly a definitive must if you can afford it.",5,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights. Had a Executive room on the 49th Floor over looking the city. Size is everything when it comes to this hotel. Our room was beautifully appointed, bed was fantastic and the view was incredible especially at night. The pool experience is a must, though very busy. The executive lounge was well catered but again very busy. The shopping centre which is part of the complex is again a must to see.  Very few hotels blow us away but this amazing hotel is one for the bucket list  Highly recommend",5,
"I have no chance to stay in this hotel because it's full booked. I have 2 days conference there. I booked a tour for my family and go there together because the easiest pick up is from MBS Basement 1. It's a huge place and I get confused. I am with my old parents and small children and my wife. It's so hectic.   I arrived at Tower 1. The security came to us, and politely asked what they can do for us.   I told him that I don't stay there, I've a conference only, and my family will be picked up in their hotel basement.  The security then escorted us to show all these venues. He valued us very much and my son was so happy. The Security also told us what we can do and enjoy in MBS even if we don't stay there.  The best thing is he sincerely suggested me to go to the conference so I…",5,
"There is a very good reason why any review of Singapore features the infinity pool on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore. There is only thing more quintessential than a Singapore Sling at the bar beside the infinity pool, and that is the same drink at the world famous Aggie Greys Raffles hotel. Unfortunately it is closed for renovations and we were delighted to venture to this hotel. Service was invented in this city and it should be mandatory for any American Hotel management training to spend some time here understanding the art of service, that isn't tip driven. My sling may have been on the strong side (I know, can you ever believe someone actually admitting that??) for 3pm, but flavour, presentation, and mix was perfect. Thank you for day 1 perfection.",5,
"We had been here in June 2018, it was a nice experience,the hotel is big & has got the longest elevated infinity pool in the world.We stayed on the 47th floor city facing room,which had really good view. The size of the rooms is big & it’s really very well maintained. The main attraction was the Infinity pool,its best to be visited in early hours or late evening as its very hot for the rest of the day.The view from the top was mesmerising,you get a panoramic view of the city,Singapore-Malaysian border is also visible from here. Its also connected to The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands Mall,which has all the big brands in it. It’s also connected to Gardens by The Bay by a bridge directly from the hotel. It’s a once in a lifetime experience staying in this hotel.",5,
"We have seen all the cool pictures of the infinity pool and views of the city skyline and wanted to experience it ourselves.  It certainly didn't disappoint.  This place is expensive, but we did go out of our way to stay a night here on a recent stay and couldn't be happier we did this.  First, this hotel is the only one in that stretch of land between the gardens by the bay and the city.  this gives it an incredible vantage point to visit the gardens.  The light show at the gardens was worth it to see.  I didn't feel the lightshow by the lake/bay area was worth it.   A couple of high lights 1.  Rooms - I stayed in tower 1.  This is by the checkin area.  We were on the 26th floor.  City view.  It was a premium city view room.  The room was very clean, well furnished and stylish.…",5,
"Well, where shall I begin to write? Do you want to hear about the beauty of the building? Or rather of the details in the rooms? Or the maybe the world's most exclusive infinity pool on the rooftop? Honestly speaking, Marina Bay Sands hotel is probably the most exclusive hotel I have stayed at.    Check-in Let me begin with the check-in desk and the high level of professionalism of the staff. Although our room check-in time was set for 2pm, the friendly lady at the front desk asked how our flight was and how long it was. It was a no-brainer to understand that with two little kids it might be helpful to arrange an early check-in. And yes, we got a room pretty early in the morning. We thank her for this exceptional service.   Room Our Deluxe Twin Room was facing the bay with the…",5,
"Amazing hotel and property, although due to the size its over run with people, if your looking for a quiet getaway, this is'nt for you..... Although the pool on level 57 must be seen to be believed.....!",5,
"I stayed in a club room. Highly reccommended and well worth the extra. Check in was comfortable in the lounge next to the regular room check in, where queing as in an airport security check line.  Room, spotless, in the high floor with great wiews. Access to Club55 is the best part. Good place to be during sunset, enjoying some drinks. Breakfast in Club55 was also good, with lots of choises, although there are 4-5 restaurants to choose from for breakfast.  All staffs I interacted with were proffessional and very friendly.  Ill be back.  Ill be back ",5,
The hotel is always very busy being an iconic place.. We stayed here for 2 nights was a bit expensive but the room view of the bay and guest entrance to the infinity pool was worth it.. The main attraction is the pool and it is worth the swim in it.. The evening swims are just magical and the opposite side of the building overlooks and you can see the gardens by the bay man made sculptured  trees light up in spectacular colour.. Definitely worth a night stay just for the 3 things mentioned..,5,
"Had one night in this fantastic hotel and wished it had been more.  From check in to check out couldn't fault the place.  The room was fabulous, bathroom amazing with huge bath, two separate wash hand basins, walk in shower, curtains open when entering the room and close when leaving, huge room with all the usually stuff from slippers, robe, tea & coffee iron etc., wish we could have spent more time in the room but its all about the infinity pool.  Absolutely amazing, the views are amazing, spent the whole day at the pool and later when the sun starting to set the pool was still warm.  Huge shopping centre in the hotel and loads of restaurants.  Staff very friendly everywhere.  Checked out in the morning and left our bags till the evening.  Best part was able to use the…",5,
"This Hotel has everything, definitely hits you a bit harder on the pockets, but it’s worth it. Every person once in a lifetime should stay here & swim at that magnificent Infinity pool.  We stayed at the Premier room which came with a balcony and gorgeous view of the Gardens by the Bays.  You will be spoilt for choices regarding the choices you will have, from food to shopping, everything is just underneath at the Shoppes.  Don’t miss out on SweetSpot (Tower 3) & High Society B2 for some dreamy looking desserts, which tasted just as amazing as it looked.",5,
I surprised my partner with a one night stay at the Marina Bay Sands. When we arrived we were taken to the VIP check in area despite not being VIP. The view from our hotel room looked out on to the gardens by the bay. Both day and night views were spectacular. We had a huge king size bed and bath and spent a few hours relaxing in the infinity pool. Would highly recommended a night here for a special occasion. ,5,
"Wow wow wow!!! We booked a family room at MBS for 4 nights in luxury in Singapore as we wanted to do a city break before we went on to Thailand and we were not disappointed.   It was the first time we had flown such a distance with our two children aged 3 and 6 and we wanted to make sure we had enough space for us all to relax and rest and this room was perfect!  The check in process was a little longer than we'd have liked, but once we were checked in it was easy enough. We were in tower 1 right above reception, which was perfect for us as it meant we could get to the mall and taxis easily, as well as the infinity pool.   The Family room was huge! There was a smaller toilet room as you walked in and then a kitchen area with (prefilled) fridge, sink, coffee machine and lots of…",5,
"I came here with some friends. We had a good vacation. We were attracting by convenience of the hotel. We likes the pool of this place. Otherwise, whole night scene of Singapore city was very spectacular when we saw from the roof of Marina Bay Sand hotel.",5,
We were at Marina Bay Sands for our Staycation. It was an unforgettable experience for the family.   Staff were polite and ready to meet our needs.  Facilities were clean and well maintained The Infinity Swimming Pool was the best highlight for my kids. We were thrill by the wonderful view from the pool. A good bird view of the city in the pool.   Food is rather pricey at the hotel but a good short walk to Marina Square you can find a variety of food at a reasonable price.,5,
"Recently stayed 2 nights in a suite on the 21st floor. We had water to city views which were wonderful. The room was large and comfortable but the couch was hard and not good for relaxing.  We especially enjoyed night time views of the super trees and city views from the large bathroom.  Suggest requesting a room above the 22nd floor to avoid having to transfer elevators to access the pool. It is very busy and can take a while if you need to use 2 elevators.  The suite included access to club 55 for breakfast, tea and canapes. Breakfast was wonderful but only got to the afternoon tea one time which was very nice. Staff eager to help and very efficient .  The pool was the main attraction for me however I was disappointed . The view was amazing, but the overall pool experience…",4,
"Loved our delux room! So cute - they brought us chocolate and welcomed us on our honeymoon. It was so clean and exceptionally high level service, as we expected with this establishment! It definitely lived up to expectations. The pool is phenomenal, and we came during fireworks for practice for their Independence Day of Singapore in August, so coming up! Very amazing show. Would love to come back and visit!! ",5,
"As you must be a guest at the hotel to use the famous rooftop infinity pool, it definitely has to be done at least once. We were lucky enough to skip the queue for check in as someone took us to another check in desk, but I do see we could have waited a long time to check in. It is a busy place.  Our room was ready 2 hours early so we could fully check in. We found a spot by the pool easily, perhaps because it was lunch time, as we saw it started to fill up quite quickly and by 3/4pm, spaces were limited on loungers. Yes, the pool is a little crowded but it is to be expected of course. Everyone is taking photos and selfies all afternoon and evening long. But again, what else to expect. We had complimentary tea and evening canapés at club 55. Tea was nice and easy to get a table…",5,
Love love love this place!! Our room was fabulous! All restaurants and bars on site although expensive are definitely worth paying the price for!! The infinity pool is something else. Some of the best views in Singapore. The only place to be!!!,5,
"My wife and I stayed in the Premier King Sky View for 1 night during our honeymoon vacation. The views from the hotel are breathtaking, especially at night. The rooftop infinity pool is gorgeous. The hotel is located next to the mall, gardens, and subway. The room was large and comfortable and the bathroom had both a bath and separate shower.      With that said, Marina Bay Sands is a very large hotel; much bigger than we expected, and there didn't seem like there were enough staff or facilities to handle the amount of guests. We arrived early morning on an overnight flight and the first thing we wanted to do was change clothes in the lobby bathroom, since our room was not ready. Both men's and women's washroom stalls had lines of 2-3 people and were a bit dirty.  There were…",3,
"Check in was supposed to commence after 3 pm, we were early and they obliged accommodation by noon, the size of the Suite was huge, more or less an apartment, with a stupendous view of the city from the 52nd floor. The service was prompt, the lounge had great variety but limited choice for vegetarians. The breakfast at the four venues was great, but yet in the other 3 restaurants vegetarian variety was limited. The view during the night from the restaurants and Singapore lights not to be missed.  A stay with good memories.",5,
"We had a garden view room in tower 1 on the 29th floor. Room was massive and had a balcony.   Staff were helpful, yea it’s expensive but for us it was a nice way to end the trip  The minibar is weighted so don’t touch anything haha $7 for a bottle of cold water.   There is honestly so much to do in this place, you will not be board. ",5,
"The MBS is quite an experience and a landmark of Singapore but not a great hotel to stay in. Far better to visit and stay elsewhere.  The building is stunning and the skypark a must see, but both of these things can be accessed without staying here (the latter with a day pass) so there's no need to fork out for a room. Furthermore, the skypark fills up very quickly so even if you are staying here, you are unlikely to get space unless you get up at the crack of dawn. By the time you factor in the hidden costs (17% extra in city tax and service charge and a four hundred dollar deposit which they will hold on to for up to three weeks with no explanation!) you are paying the price of a suite in St Pancras Renaissance Hotel, London. There are a number of other hotels on the bay which…",3,
We had booked a Premier King Garden view room but upon arriving we requested for an upgrade to the Harbor view room and voila we were given the upgrade to the Premier King Harbor View room without any charges. That was really a very good gesture by the hotel staff. The room was very comfortable and similar to other luxurious properties. The view was simply stunning. The staff and the service was up to the mark. But I feel the hotel is somewhat used for commercial purposes and lacks the nostalgia of a very luxurious hotel as there are always a lot of people and it is very crowded. The hotel needs to provide atleast free shuttle service to the airport. I am sure they can afford that and the same will make the people who stay with them merrier. You can surely spend a night or two…,4,
"I have now stayed 3 times at the MBS and feel the same way each time.  It’s a very nice hotel, no doubt about that.  Striking views, comfortable rooms, great gym(with more great views) and of course the roof pool and bars. The only drawback is that it’s a victim of its own popularity.   It is a very crowded place. Don’t come here for a romantic getaway. Excellent hotel but might be too busy for some.  ",4,
"To whom it may concern, Hotel itself is of a high standard. Despite I and my VIP guest booking king's lounge room were treatead v. unusually. Once I got back from the breakfast at the top, my keycard was blocked 9AM. This is still the beginning. I was approached by the security guys who asked for my passport and 'escorted me' in the North Korean Style to a 'room'. I was asked many details, despite I spent circa USD 1.5K for one night. Their excuse was quote unquote - that the card might had been copied... Were was the security, since I spent all the time at the hotel. I asked only for 50% refund, despite all the 'trouble'. I don't have to mention that all the things I did't pack in a hurry, were never mentioned by the hotel's manager on duty - monited. Jewelery, medication. I…",1,
"My wife and I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands a few times now. On a previous visit with our children, we stayed in a Garden View double room, with two of the kids sharing one bed, and the third on a rollaway. It was cosy, but worth it in order for the whole family to access the full experience the hotel offers.  On our most recent visit on check in, we were invited to upgrade to a family room.  For anyone staying at Marina Bay Sands for more than one night with two or more children, upgrade to the family room without hesitation. It will be the best value couple of hundred dollars (per night) you'll ever spend.  The hotel otherwise is as you'd expect - majestic. We've always been stunned by the impeccable attention to detail in the service offering. There were some renovations…",5,
A must see and stay if your heading to Singapore. The accommodation was very clean and comfortable. Twice daily service that ensured we always had a refreshed suite. The views are spectacular level 57 infinity pool a must see attraction and also the sky park worth walking around to gain a full perspective of this grand complex. Club access provided many benefits to enjoy from level 55 club lounge for breakfast to afternoon tea and then pre dinner drinks for a couple of hours. The choice of restaurants is plentiful and the shopping mall covers all of the high end brands and some. Lots to see and lots to do in a perfect positioned complex. Tip ask for a high floor city views they are awesome. ,5,

"Marina Bay Sands at Singapore is an iconic place and a truly world class luxurious casino hotel. This should be on every traveler's list of places to stay at least once in lifetime. This hotel has 3 tall towers forming pillars on which a boat shaped roof-top infinity pool & restaurants are placed. The shape in itself is so unique and is an engineering and architectural marvel. The hotel boasts of a 3 restaurants to cater to the needs of travelers and also quick access to few more dining options in adjacent Skypark mall. The main attraction is the large Infinity Pool on the rooftop, which provides a breathtaking view of the Singapore city including view of the another Singapore icon, The Merlion.

"I stayed here one night in between visiting Bali and going onto Fiji. I did ask for a room facing the gardens but because of how busy they were, I got a room facing the city but I didn’t mind because that view was incredible as well!! The room was fantastic, easy access to the gardens which were also incredible. My flight was at 9pm the next evening so they allowed me to use the pool & gym facilities until I left for my flight which I really appreciated. It meant I could chill at the pool, workout and freshen up before my flight. My only suggestion would be to maybe offer a shuttle service to the airport as so many people in the taxi queue were going to the airport but we all had to wait for separate taxis. The hotel is also connected to the shopping centre, I found this very…",5,
"We stayed for two nights in July and certainly don’t regret our stay but I fear we fall into a large category of people who say “pleased I have seen it for myself but I wouldn’t go again..”.  The first thing to say is that this hotel is one of a kind and simply can’t be compared to previous stays in any other hotel on the planet. You go here to see the architecture for yourself and to be part of the infinity pool selfie club, not because it is offering amazing service.    They have made a rod for their own back somewhat promoting that they are 5 star luxury hotel when it is clearly only 5 star based on its amenities (impressive infinity pool, spa, restaurants and shops) but please don’t be naive and think you will get 5 star service. We heard lots of people complaining in the…",3,
"Spent 2 nights in Grand Club Room(2623) , Got a corner room, which has balcony facing to Gardens and the bathroom with a view to city. It was superb. The room itself was very huge, with shower, and bathtub. We had access to Club55 lounge, it was good, but you must wait for table every time. The view from pool is incredible, there is a lot of people, but not so crowded despite of this. The prices at pool bar are reasonable. The breakfast worth every penny. Very good hotel at a perfect location.",4,
Stayed at MBS more for the infinity pool than anything else. Had to avoid the crowd and unsupervised children most of the time. Hassle-free checking in and out but then again had to deal with crowds. Buffet breakfast was good at Adrift but not Spago- again had to avoid unsupervised children.,4,
Dining at Marina Bay Sands Rise restaurant was great. Food and beverage serve was of great standard. Was attended by a lady waitress by the name of Shiao wei in the morning for breakfast. She was attentive and make a good effort to make sure everything we needed are care for. ,5,
"The hotel is amazing, staff extremely polite and food at Spago was great. The swimming pool is 29-30C, perfect temperature conversely to what I read on other comments were people complained was too cold. I got a room on the top floor, that is 49 in tower one with city view, it was spectacular . The hotel was super busy and fully booked, crowd made people fight for sunbeds, thee aren't enough for anyone although I got one for all day without issues. Also the staff at the check in desk must be doubled in number to reduce the queue, same for the guys that carry the bag, when I arrived Noone helped me with the luggage out of the taxi, someone came only 20 minutes later while I i was queueing for check-in.

Tourist trap.  Overpriced everything.  The pool thing has jumped the shark.  Only tourists that still want to be here are from lesser developed areas that are still a couple of years behind.   There's construction everywhere. The food court at the mall has been halved. Resulting in 30 minute lines for mediocre food. Elevators are constantly non-operating leading to packed elevators that stop on every floor.  Even the bell staff have to use the guest elevators essentially occupying the entire cab with their luggage carts.   Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere far from here. It's a short cab ride if you feel the inexcusable need to be here.  We stayed in an Orchid suite for the 3rd time and this is supposed to be a premier suite.  Room was tiny.  There is zero consistency in…,1,
"In my opinion, the hotel itself is nothing really exceptional - it’s huge and the building looks awesome. What expects you on the inside is simply mass processing, but in a very friendly and effective manner. Our room was nice but somehow felt a little uninspired, the wow-effect that I often have when entering a 5* hotel room was missing. However, the towel-dog that greeted us was a nice surprise - I’m not sure if this is a standard or a special touch because we were on our honeymoon. But the Marina Bay Sands Hotel has one unique selling point - and I think for many of its guest this is the main reason for choosing it: the amazing infinity pool on the roof. It was not a surprise to us that it was always really crowded, but it is definitely a cool experience to watch the sunset…",4,
The hotel is so nice and convenient to stay. The are lots of shops just next to the hotel and lots of restaurants open 24/7 as well.  The accommodation is a bit expensive compare to other hotels but it’s worth it when it comes to the hotel facilities. As they have the best infinity pool and there bar Spago is really nice as well.  The infinity pool is the best pool with the best view the only problem is it’s too crowded. Most of the time there’s no place to sit as all the pool chair are occupied.   When we checked in we had a bad experienced as the receptionist who checked us in is not helpful and tried to make us feel uncomfortable when we asked information about the shops around the areas and we’ve been promised as well that we’ll have a cake in the room by the one of the…,4,
"Stayed on a staycation for one night, mostly to see what the fuss was about and to use the pool as the only way in is to be a guest.  The view is simply stunning, the bars and restaurants look to have had a lot of effort put in, and the rooms are above average though not spectacular. Keep in mind it is highly targeted at Chinese mainland gaming tourists.",4,
"The pool, the good-sized room and the location made this hotel stay a worthwhile experience. We stayed on the 15th floor of the third tower, overlooking the city and it was a lovely view. Staying a bit higher would allow you to see the light show, probably. It was my husband's birthday and a complimentary  platter of chocolates was sent up to the room, which was a nice touch. We didn't have the breakfast (having read about the queues) but the food court and the deli on the ground floor was great. It was a little busy on the pool deck but not enough that you couldn't enjoy the atmosphere. Checking in took a bit of time but if you're prepared, the process will go a bit faster. As  the hotel is a tourist attraction, you have to expect that there are a few more people around than in…",5,
"The hotel is fantastic, but compare with my stay 2 years ago, this time the standard is being let down by overcrowding.   We need to queue a hour just to be seated for afternoon tea at the executive lounge. And the food is of a less quality .  It reached the point that I would stay somewhere else next time when i am in Singapore.",3,
"Having seen a documentary on this hotel prior to arrii=ving I thoiught I was prepared.  However, the view of this hotel coming over the causeway from the airport is jaw drpping.   The hotel is comprised of three 57 story towers and what looks like a space ship sitting on top.  It is so big that there are two separate checkin lobbies depending on what room you re staying in.  On the roof is an infinity pool which spans all three towers, three full service restauarnts and a multitude of bars.  The infinity pool on the roof and view are not to be missed.  The rooms were nice and clean.  We stayed in rooms facing the garden; however, I would recommend rooms that face downtown in the city.  The hotel has a Banyan Tree Spa where I had one of the best massages that I have ever…",4,
"Luxury at its best overlooking Marina Bay and Singapore herself. The infinity pool on the roof was the main attraction for us, including the rooftop drinks and views. You're in the best location for the evening light show displays and city night life. This hotel is beautiful, unique and part of the Singapore experience.",5,
"Had the best 2 nights ever in this fabulous hotel.  We are a family of 5 so booked 2 x Club rooms which includes breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapes. I was a bit worried with some of the reviews saying it wasn't worth the money, but I have to disagree, it was worth every penny to experience the comfort and views of this iconic hotel. We were extremely fortunate to be given a free upgrade to a Straits Suite which was absolutely amazing we had views of the city and a balcony with views of the Gardens by the bay.  I would say that it is well worth booking the club room to benefit from the food and drink on offer as it was plentiful and staff were very welcoming and pleasant. The pool is amazing, not over crowded at all, on both days we were able to access a sun…",5,
"MBS is an amazing hotel in the newish part of Singapore.  It does not have the charm of the older City Center (where i normally stay while in Singapore) but it is well worth a try. I stayed in Tower 3.  Very busy and always full of tourists who go to the top floor to enjoy the infinity pool and the amazing views.  Go there in the evening to see the light show - not quite of the caliber of the ""son et lumiere"" shows you find in Europe but enjoyable. The shopping center attached to MBS is somewhat boring unless you want to see the largest concentration of watch stores outside of Geneva, but it has some very nice restaurants worth the visit.",5,
"My wife and I with our kids, we loved this place. It is very clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful. You can easily find a transportation around the hotel. You can enjoy the pool at the 57 floor. The only problem is the hotel is very big and very crowded. ",4,
"Enjoyed a couple of nights stay here in a family room. Not long enough, I didn't want to leave.   Our room was very spacious, clean and ultra modern. Very high end. Everything about our stay was extremely positive. The view from the pool is amazing especially at night time. The hotel service, the restaurants, the shopping, what more could you want. Can't wait to stay here again on our next visit to Singapore. ",5,
"The infinity pool on 57th floor alone was worth the stay!! Breathtaking view with the friendliest staff one could hope for.   The Grand Club Room was beyond fantastic, such a comfortable bed with a magnificent view to Gardens by the Bay. ",5,
"Stayed here for a couple of nights and had the best time. Myself and my friend had a beautiful twin room overlooking the gardens by the bay which was spacious and very well decorated. Spent one evening at the Ce La Vi club at the Skypark and thoroughly enjoyed it. Spent hours at the infinity pool as the view is absolutely stunning and the music adds a nice vibe to the atmosphere. Loved that the pool had an adults only section as there were no noisy kids splashing around beside us which meant we were able to relax. Cant rate the staff highly enough either, so helpful and polite. Long story short this hotel is worth every penny you spend on staying there. I highly recommend it.",5,
"We expected so much from the hotel. First encounter with a staff wasn’t pleasant. Excellent customer service wasn’t present at all. We signed up for Sands rewards since we booked from their website, but she didn’t even give us great information where to go for our rewards and the gist of the membership. I didn’t feel the service it should have as a renowned hotel in Asia.   Room is small, like an inn but most of their equipment in the room are hi-tech and accessible. We were put in 8th floor facing the Garden bay. According to the receptionist, we were only allowed until 9th floor in Tower 3.  Infinity pool is huge but crowded. It’s a tourist area, everyone’s taking photos. Tower 3 doesn’t have a formal lobby. It is connected to the mall, easy access.   Hotel doesn’t provide…",3,
The marvel exhibition was superb. The exhibition combined art and lighting. A place where children and adults can enjoy.,4,
"It may look like you are entering a shopping mall when you first land at MBS but once you are done with the check-in formalities which is smooth & may take 8-10 minutes (they have almost 8 -10 desks for check-in), you need to find your way to the room on your own with a little help as everyone here seems to be lost in such a humungous property. The person at the checkin counter upgraded us to a Suite without any request from our side looking at our kid & gave us a beautiful room with a huge balcony. Hotel offers one of the best view of entire Singapore, offers good food of any cuisine, service is prompt, staff here is very helpful & greets & provides service with a smile. Infinity Pool @ 57th Floor gives you a magical view of entire city, it will take you a while to immerse…",5,
We booked for one night at the end of our holiday in Singapore. It was an amazing experience and I would do it again in a heart beat.  We arrived at 2pm and walked straight up to check in and were able to be checked in to our room immediately. We were in tower 3 so that may have reduced some of the cues. From there it was straight to the pool (which is just incredible) which wasn't too busy and we got pool side seats. The pool did start to get busy about 4pm.   We had in room dining which was expensive but the service and the meals were excellent. We really couldn't fault our stay and would have loved to stay another night.   Worth every dollar! We will (hopefully) be back!,5,
"Check in: slow check in even after completing online check in. Did not get the rooms requested took over 1/2 hour of insisting on a room with a view. We had to comprise on room set ups. Foyer: Crowded and busy.  Location: Good for the gardens but not much else. Has its own MRT station in its shopping mall. We like to walk places and found it a little difficult from Marina Bay. Facilities: Infinity pool should be renamed selfie pool. Crowded, noisy, shallow not relaxing at all. Rooms: Rooms were comfortable and good size and views of gardens stunning. Overall: You stay at Marina Bay Sands to say you’ve stayed there. We won’t be gong back. Save yourself some money and stay at a boutique hotel downtown. ",2,
"The pool was amazing but very crowded. The staff are professional. The rooms are ok. Went to yoga class in the morning but dis organised. Spent 20min just waiting to start and another 35min waiting to sign off. With the busy schedule with family, it was too much of wasting time. Not a good start of the day. Dissapointing.",2,
I Had Visited SINGAPORE IN AUG end 2017 IT WAS A RAINY Weather During This time of the year STAYED IN THIS HOTEL FOR One night reached hotel  AT 12.30 PM EXCEPT FOR THE CHECKIN PERIOD everything went on really Good from hotels lobby to view of the room.  Than we planned to go to the pool which is there on the top floor of this hotel in the shape of ship ....Lot of TOURISTS comes here but they are not allowed to use the pool charm of the hotel . THEY HAVE CASINO ALSO IN THE HOTEL WHICH WORKS FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT ... I WOULD SAY ONE SHOULD REALLY STAY FOR TWO NIGHTS HERE TO NJOY BEST OF SINGAPORE,5,
"Hotel building is impressive, with the infinity pool being the main attraction. However, the pool is more of a photoshoot location than a functioning pool. Check in and check out are overcrowded with long queues, although an express check out can be availed of. Rooms were comfortable and wifi was fast. Good location with nice views, particularly for Gardens by the Bay.",4,
"Outstanding hotel with the pool that never sleeps. It’s packed at 11 pm or 6 am :). Absolutely indescribable views of Singapore at night . Full bar service by the pool, enjoy your cocktails ! Variety of restaurants and fresh bakeries for every spoiled soul :)!",5,
"One of the most iconic hotels in singapore was sadly dissapointing. The iconic infinity pool really is the only thing that differs from other hotels in singapore. Surely the rooms look great and the overall design is impressive and surely the location is great but....  Great rooms, designs and locations are available everywhere in singapore. At much cheaper rates.  The pricing really is over the top and almost disturbing the holliday feeling. You really just pay for the infinity pool (which is really impressive)  During our stay the room smelled like someone had smoked sigarettes in it and the toilet was not flushing. The hotel did not give any compensation.   The breakfast and check in where waaay to busy and not at all what you would expect for this price.   Conclusion:…",2,
Marina Bay Sands hotel is Singapore's famous iconic hotel. Located next to garden by the bay and Singapore Flyer.,4,
"You can’t go wrong with this hotel. The hotel staff is very attentive & does not fail to acknowledge your presence. Their hotel and grounds are immaculately clean. The restaurant selection is delicious and their bar at Adrift serves the best drinks! I love the way they ask your first name, and acknowledge you at every turn.  Their hotel rooms are roomy & extremely well maintained. I loved the city view that overlooks the merlion & esplanade.   The Infinity Pool on the 57th floor is amazingly gorgeous. Be warned it gets crowded. There are tourists who pretend to not understand that the Adult area should not have kids there — they keep trying, but the lifeguards are good about policing them and courteously telling them to move.  Food at all the restaurants are awesome!  The resort…",5,
"We stayed in 47th floor with city views and that was absolutely amazing. The room was huge and clean, service was excellent and food in hotel restaurants delicious. I'll write a longer review to my blog later this year but so far I can tell you that this hotel definitely is worth it!",5,
"Marina Bay Sands was a wonderful place to stay. Centrally located in Downtown Singapore we were able to walk to Gardens by The Bay, attend the Lion King performance within the Sands Theatre, access numerous restaurants and shopping facilities without going too far from home base.   Our room was wonderful. It was spacious, well appointed and professionally serviced. Our housekeeper was delightful, offering to help or give us water every time we happened by. To be honest, we were pretty much won over when we put the keycard into the power socket and the curtains opened automatically, offering a view of the Gardens by the Bay and Singapore Straits.   To enhance our relaxing stay we took advantage of the Room Service offerings. The breakfast was to die for. Simple eggs benedict with…",5,
"Surprised my partner by staying here for our last night in Singapore and was not disappointed. The service was fantastic, the rooms spacious and clean. The view from the pool was incredible and our view from our room was awesome. The infinity pool was crowded and cold but made up for it with the spectacular view. ",5,
"This hotel is top class....offering excellent service from start to finish. Rooms are immaculate, hotel staff are extremely polite and helpful and everything you need is in there (it is very big!). The views from the infinity pool are amazing and there are plenty of great photo opportunities but it does get very busy so you need to get down early or stay later into the evening if you want the golden photo opportunity and a lounger near the pool edge. Overall I couldn’t fault the service or the room. Used room service several times for breakfast and it was delicious. I had a garden view room which looks over the marina bay gardens and these are so beautiful. Much better than the city view!",5,
"We had booked three rooms during a busy weekend. Valet parking was $12 per 24hrs with multiple reentry. The view from the rooms were definitely incredible though we preferred the Garden view to the City view. BUT, the infinity swimming pool was crowded and small, world famous views yes. The children's pool was filthy, shame. The staff lost two plastic bags of ours during porterage(slung onto our luggages), and they only found it the next day. They did extend one room by a few hours out of goodwill but we were told two had been extended, leading to us getting stranded. The staff were generally pleasant, but it was these little things which really which put us off.",3,
"Amazing hotel well worth the money. Upgrade to a club room and make the most of all the benefits like afternoon tea, evening canapé and access to club 55 with great views.  However the swimming pool is always so crowded.  Overall great experience. Will definitely come back.",5,
"My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for 3 days and two nights. Prior we stayed elsewhere which was a nice contrast. At Marina bay sands, our room was a city view  and the view was fantastic! The infinity pool had an amazing view! The staff was welcoming and provided you with immediate assistance. It is a very large hotel with many people, yet the facility is very secured for guests safety. Breakfast is not included but you can get breakafast at an extra cost in the hotel (it's expensive). If you are looking for a reasonable price for breakfast in front of the hotel is a mall they have a food court and other options. The weather in July was very humid, hot, sunny, and cloudy.",4,
"Fantastic room with an unbelievable view, especially at night. Outstanding service. Breakfast at Spago on the skypark for tremendous views with a great buffet. I don't think I need to say anything about the pool. It may be cheaper to book directly with the hotel.",5,
"We can't get enough of its architecture, the vibe, different activities, malls and the performances that this place brings together. A must visit for anyone in Singapore even for a short while. Take a full circular walk around this place to truly experience the surroundings!",5,
"Stayed here for one night, only wish we had more time.  Our room was excellent with a garden view which was mesmerising.  The balcony was huge.  We used all the facilities on the rooftop including bars, pool (of course) and restaurant.  I cannot fault this hotel.  Hope I can visit again some time.",5,
"Sands SkyPark is on top of three hotel towers at Marina Bay Sands, one of the best panoramic views of Singapore.  Visitors to the skypark can also access to KUDETA which offers drinks and dining.  Hotel guests also can access to the 150 meter infinity swimming pool, amazing city view !  let’s experience one of the world’s most amazing hotel rooftop pools !!",5,
"we as a family stayed in the month of April 2018. The staff was courteous and check in was smooth . We stayed in Presidential suite which was like pampering one to the extreme especially my kid who would not get out of the mini theater inside our room. My wife loved playing the baby piano and I loved the gym . Coming outside all of us thoroughly enjoyed the infinity pool and sky deck so much that we cancelled all our remaining outings in Singapore!!. We went to the deck for light show at 8pm, but were dissapointed  as the lazer show was too below and the main lighting was coming from the hotel itself!!!.   The next breakfast was sumptuous but I was totally dissapointed as the waitress was insisting on billing for my 6yr old for breakfast also which I felt was not right. The…",4,
"I have been drooling over the infamous architecture and rooftop infinity pool at this property via instagram for years now and I finally got to stay here! However, I gotta say I was sorely disappointed. Was the city scape pool breathtaking? Yes. Was staying in such a famous location cool as heck? Yes. But the buck stopped there. At $600/night I expected the service to impeccable and it was so lackluster. NOTHING is included in that price. Pretty much a mini water bottle is given to you at check in and that’s the last thing you’ll get. I guess I just expect more from a 5 star property. It was overrun with non guests-I understand much of the hotel is public space, but there are seemingly no privileges. When paying such large amounts you can’t just let your famous pool do the…",2,
"This is a must-visit within the concrete jungle that is Singapore. The shopping complex is endless with upscale luxury brands all around, so be prepared to walk a lot. There are plenty of F&B outlets as well, from Michelin Star restaurants to a food court that remains open even around 11pm.",5,
I've been there for a 2 day seminar and it is a great place with verity of foods and good service. Location also nice and the view is superb. easy to reach there too. Recommend this place if anyone is visiting Singapore.,5,
"Hotel and Services are top notch....even waiting for check in, we were offered mineral water. The staff was friendly and efficient. The room was extremely clean and so comfortable and the bathroom is spacious. The infinity pool is a must visit even one doesn’t swim.... the view is spectacular!! Don’t miss the water show, Spectra, such a fantastic display and was so entertaining. The hotel is walking distance to food, restaurants, shopping, entertaining and casino!! Waiting to visit again....",5,
Huge complex with everything you can expect inside. Breakfast is rich and tasty. Rooms very well maintained and outstanding cooperative stsff. Ofcourse the sky swimming pool is enormous. One thing to comment is the chack in and chack out process that is very slow. Takes half an hour to wsit in the line. Besides this - great placr to return to.  BRAVO !,5,
Having a few nights with my husband we had been told about Marina Bay Sands.  The word that comes to mind is AMAZING! We checked in with such wonderful service. We took the lift to our suite and as soon as we opened the door my husband and I were blown away. It was the biggest most lavish suite we have ever seen. The view was incredible.  Our luggage arrived within 10 minutes. Our package included free drinks and canapés from 5pm - 7pm. That was any alcohol beverage and as many as you could consume. The canapés just keep coming.  I highly recommend anyone to stay here!  Oh and the infinity pool was incredible.   Will definitely go back!,5,
"Each time we go through Singapore we always stay in Marina Bay Sands for a night. The hotel rooms are lovely and so much bigger compared to other hotels. But it’s the location and the facilities and services that blow your mind. Obviously, the infinity pool is fantastic! The gym is fabulous too. And the hotel service from the check in through to the check out is super fast and great quality . We will be back again!",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands has in short time become an indispensable icon on the Singapore skyline. The hotel itself is very much like Las Vegas by the Bay. It is huge (2560 rooms), inhabited by massive crowds and runs at a fast pace. It has excellent rooms with spaceous bathrooms, and the hotel facilities are in proportion to its overall size - the Arift Bar, the celavi and Spago restaurants are all great, and then of course there is the infinity swimming pool literally hanging high over the Bay.  It is wonderful for a couple of days, especially with kids, but then it is time to move to quieter, less hectic surroundings - the novelty has worn out.",4,
"The hotel architecturally is stunning. 3 towers with we hat looks like a boat on top of them. And the view from the top is breathtaking.  The rooms are l as the, well appointed, well serviced and... expensive.  And lots and lots of people going in and out and around.  It is good but too busy.",4,
"Enjoyed my 2 day stay here.  From check in to check out (Thank You, Mark Anthony) the process was smooth and the customer service was excellent.  In room dining for breakfast was prompt.  In the room, we were greeting with a cute towel bunny surprise on the bed.  City View was gorgeous especially at night.  In addition, you can see the Sprectra show but without the music and full effect from the room.  Housekeeping personnel are a real gem...super warm and friendly - Thank you Xiao Li!",5,
"Spent 2 nights at this property and really didn’t rate it. Because the only reason worth staying here is to get access to the famous rooftop-infinity pool which you only get access to if you’re a hotel guest. The lobby of the hotel was extremely busy, like a busy busy mall, and as reception stated upon checkin that the hotel was at full capacity, we were advised a bell-hop service could take up to an hour for luggage to get sent to our room. I think there was a shortage of housekeeping too as there was a woman’s hair on the glass shelving in our room, picture attached.  The hotel location is good and ironically there is a direct access to the mall and metro station, but so many people are in the lobby or on the bridge (to the gardens by the bay) that I would really not recommend…",3,
"Clean, friendly and a must stay. The cocktails at the roof top bar are a must. The infinity pool is bliss. The shopping is a definite must if you are shopping for the high end labels. Close to the future gardens. ",5,
"View at the infinity pool is obviously remarkable and that is the main reason why I chose to stay in the Marina Bay Sands hotel and it really worth the price. The pool area can get a bit crowded and you should expect that from this renowned pool. Despite the crowd, there's always enough space for you to enjoy and click some selfies. You must watch the sunrise which is a remarkable sight especially when you are in a hot jacuzzi. Also, I got amazed by seeing the giant trees in the garden on the deck. Room was spacious, comfortable and clean. However, I felt that the reception area is ordinary in this extraordinary hotel and I believe the appearance should be improved.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful modern hotel. Amazing structure makes it a place to visit and far more a place to stay. Everything met my expectations as you would hope staying on a hotel this famous. Its a money well spent of £599 per night including breakfasts... if you're really just after the infinity pool.  The check in process was awfully long and waiting for few hours. We were welcomed and greeted by the VIP host with a cool strawberry mango and ice cream while waiting to check in.    The infinity pool was absolutely amazing and  breath taking. The service by the pool was wonderful and stunningly sorrounded by a vibrant atmosphere. Do not go to the pool area during peak hours. Its very crowded, good luck in getting good selfie lol with people wearing thongs out there 😂. …",5,
This a must if visiting Singapore. A truly iconic hotel and an architectural masterpiece.  Facilities excellent as is location - as a tourist or business traveller.   Be warned that its massive and so a quick walk to a restaurant for breakfast or to the bar can take some time (and exercise)  Wear comfy shoes!   The pool of course is incredible and views to die for.   Pool service can be a little slow.   All room amenities are 5*,5,
"The hotel has the most extraordinary views and a very nice pool. But that’s it really.   Over the course of three days I found myself endlessly wueining and waiting. Everything I’m this hotel is done extremely slowly. Check in took one hour. The queue for the breakfast rooms are 30-40 people deep. The wait to check out was 45 minutes. Taxi rank is crazy. Service in the restaurants is arduous and slow slow slow, painfully slow. They clearly cannot accommodate the hotels large capacity.   This is not a peaceful or relaxing place, rather it has the chaotic and intense atmosphere of something like Disneyland. It’s just too much. I’d rather stay in a small, quiet hotel. Next time I will.",2,
Room spacious and views tremendous. However with 2500 rooms to full capacity with a minimum of two per room the hotel felt crowded. This wasn't helped by two levels of shopping malls below the main promenade plus a metro station plus a conference centre (3500 people) made for an uncomfortable experience. Restaurants expensive and breakfast was buffet style which for a 5 star hotel charging the prices they do was most disappointing. Staff were very accommodating though and went out of their way to help,3,
"Stayed for one night as a treat in way home from Malaysia.  Service is second to none at checkin.  Room nice but the view is amazing.  We went to the roof infinity pool, this was one of the main reasons we wanted to stay, they were cleaning one of the pools during an obviously busy time making us all squeeze into one pool.  Our tv stopped working and the hairdryer was broken.  Not what you would expect when staying in a place like this.  It’s a very large hotel with ALOT of people - it can take a while to walk from one place to another.  I would definitely stay in one of the hotels on the other side of the bay next time so we could look at the building.",4,
"If you plan on travelling to Singapore splurge for a night or two at the Marina Bay Sands.  The Skypark pool is truly an experience to remember!!  The views of Singapore are amazing!! There is also the viewing deck which is amazing as well.  The hotel itself, is pretty much chaotic.  People everywhere.  The rooms are nice but nothing extraordinary.  We stayed for 2 nights purely for the Skypark pool and then headed off to another hotel.",5,
"One of landmark of Singapore. Definitely very interesting for visit and for the views, but it is horrific expensive. Very close to city center and Gardens of the Bay. Also in the lobby, there are channels, that remind Venice!!! And near the channels- big ice skating pool!!!  ",4,
"I decided on a memorable stay in Singapore with my daughters for my 50th instead of a party at home.  And of course you just have to stay a night here, even just for the bucket list.  Yes it is pricey, but wow...what a fantastic place.  I recommend a late check out to 6pm, as the whole place was a bit quieter in the late morn.  The staff were fantastic, from the greeting when you step out the taxi, front reception, room service staff......everybody.  The hotel even organised for a cake to be delivered to my room to celebrate my birthday.  Was a very nice touch...and a very nice cake.!! I have been watching the reviews since booking a stay and was a little worried that it wouldn't meet expectation, but it certainly did.  We didn't find the king bed too small, had a wonderful…",5,
"This hotel is just BEAUTIFUL to look at during the day or evening, and to be able to stay there is JUST WONDERFUL! our fam of 5 stayed in a Jr suite and it was a great space for us. we had a m. bdrm, a living space w/ a sofa bed and a HUGE bathroom, that we all shared. Yes, it is nice to have 2 baths, w/ a fam of 5, but this bathroom was spacious and also had a tub, so the littlest one could use it while the orders could shower. (we have 3 girls) When you book a jr suite,  you also get bfast buffet included w/ your stay for anyone 13yr+. Children are additional cost and you may eat at 3 diff rest at the hotel.

A nice view from 32nd floor facing the Garden by the Bay. A good panaromic view with ships on the sea as back drop. Night view is spectacular with changing colour of the lights on the Super Trees. Up on 57 floor is the Infinity Pools with majestic views of Singapore. Choice if restaursnts for breakfast and breakfast is nice af the Rise located at Tower 1. A comfortable stay and had a good night sleep. Bravo.,4,
"This hotel is just AWESOME. We booked this hotel online through their website and everything ran smoothly from start to finish. At check in we asked if they had a connecting room as we could only book seperate rooms online, so they abligingly  changed our room to connecting on the 43rd floor overlooking the city, and how stunning it was at night. The room had 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with both bedrooms having lounges; very spacious rooms with floor to ceiling windows.   The Infinity pool on the top is MAGNIFICENT.... .AWESOME  Wish i was still there. 10+ stars from me. ",5,
"Huge check in lines, staff at the counters stressed out... room small for the price and a double bed sold as King size... tv not working (cheap remote control) technician comes and ""fix"" it, next day I can't make it work again... Pool was great, staff helpful but croissant at breakfast in the pool tasted old, not good. Great location and shops, restaurants over priced as well",3,
"Awesome experience..myself and wife stayed 2 days . Best place to relax.infinity pool is amazing..staffs r friendly. Transportation facilities are very good like metro ,buses, and taxi facilities are very near to the hotel.",5,
"Very much enjoyed a birthday lunch at the Ce La Vi Restaurant.  Service by the wait staff was good, but felt a little rushed. Outstanding Maitre d' called John was knowledgable on the wines and provided great service.",4,
"Found this hotel over priced,and overrated,check in was like a airport or bus terminal (people everywhere) had a /ever in the bar on the roof $25 for one drink,really,  room was bland, will not be returning",2,
"It's nice to stroll through the gardens beside the hotel then grab some lunch at the rooftop.  There is a restaurant as well a café overlooking the infinity pool.  Keep in mind they don't open until lunch.  If dining beside the pool, there is an entrance fee for non-hotel guests.  The fee is credited towards your bill.  If you prefer the restaurant, reservations are strongly suggested.  There is a large indoor mall at the lower level of the hotel.  Wide variety of shopping offered.",5,
"I stayed here when I was part of a conference and for a few days before and after for holiday.  Rooms were great, service was excellent, staff attentive.  Breakfasts were a treat.  But it is so big- I got lost getting to my room the first day.  With the conference facility so near it was an excellent location both for business and pleasure especially with the MRT so near.  The restaurants in the hotel are excellent and the pool at the top great for taking a selfie - don't bother about trying to swim though!  To be honest I'd probably look to stay in a smaller hotel if I was just going for holiday - it really did feel like an extension of the conference and shopping centre.",4,
"The hotel is every bit as spectacular as it is made out to be. The views from the 57th floor are iconic and mesmerising. I don't think we've ever taken so many selfies and I'm amazed that more people don't drop their phones in the pool.  The room allowed us views of both the gardens as well as the city from the bathroom, best bath I've ever had.  Service was friendly and efficient, as you would expect in Singapore.  Can't wait to return!",5,
"Could see light show from room, favorite food was the burger.  Going back just for the burger.  Hotel is like a complete town.  Ice skating, groceries, food court, casino, pool, restaurants, access to train for airport.  All inside hotel.",5,
"We treated ourselves to a night here and it was worth the price!! Paid a bit extra to ensure we had a room higher up and a view of the marina and gardens. Would definitely recommend doing this - you'd be gutted if you paid the money and ended up being at the bottom of the hotel!  Incredible views from our room, the pool was amazing - they have 3 and one of those is adult only which makes a big difference. Great for a swim and open from 6am-11pm! Would definitely recommend even if it's just to get the pool pictures!  Service was great and check in and check out we're both smooth processes (would recommend the speedy check out option as the queues for checking out in the morning are crazy long)! We also had a lovely meal at CELAVI restaurant on the roof which was one of the best…",5,
"Everything we had hoped for and more, stayed in the King Club Room and had beautiful views of the city. The wait staff at Club 55 were friendly, professional and personal and were very fun and attentive to my young son. Reception/door staff were also very professional and well mannered. Room was enormous and the travel size Robert Cavalli amenities were a nice treat. We went as a once in a lifetime bucket list trip in March 2018, and we've rebooked for November this year. An experience not to be missed.",5,
"The room: Really spacious with a good view of the Gardens by the Bay  The pool: The best! That infinity pool with a breathtaking view of the SG skyline.  The buffet: This is where we really, really enjoyed the food. It was a Saturday and they served Singapore’s best so we were able to have our fill of chili crabs until we were so full. The japanese selections were superb, really good sushi and the dessert were also good. Overall, I will recommend eating here. We also availed of their breakfast which was also so good.   ",5,
"We arrived at the hotel at 7am due to an early flight, and to our great relief the hotel allowed us to check in early. This was an excellent touch, and made our stay feel special!  We had a garden view room which was superb - very similar size to ones in Vegas. Obviously the main draw is the magnificent infinity pool on the top of the hotel, and I have to say this is definitely a bucket list when it comes to swimming pools! The views are simply stunning!   There are a lot of positives about this hotel as many have already mentioned but for us it felt a bit characterless, impersonal and “not the real” Singapore. We only spent 1 day /night here which is plenty, we ticked off what we wanted to see and then moved on to the Fullerton for the rest of our stay which allowed us to…",4,
A beautiful and attractive convention centre. Excellent facilities too. If only there.were more seats at common areas for those in between meetings to rest.  Lots to see and do between conventions and meetings... from Michelin starred restaurants to cheap and cheerful local fare at 1983 Taste of Nanyang. 2 thumbs up. ,5,
"If you choose to stay in marina bay , stay at 54th floor , and choose orchid club room , the infinity pool is awesome, one incident that hurt me during my stay, I was taking a selfie below the building, the security came to me and asked why did you take pictures, I told him I am staying here , then his reaction changed , it completely hurt me . And to be very honest the club dine is not at al fine , then I ordered from the room , the dinner also was not good , so there is more things to develop under this.  ",3,
"The view is insane, the hotel is insane! I loved every part of it! If you are thinking about coming to Singapore don’t doubt in staying at this hotel! I know people are going to say this is not the best hotel in service... I think my stay was pleasant and the pool and the services that the hotel gives you are worth it! ",5,
"This hotel is simply one of the most amazing places around. Needless to say the skypark on top of the hotel, with the largest infinity pool in world, is probably the biggest highlight of them all. Other than that you will find all the restaurants you could ask for, a shopping complex, a world class gym and more. We checked into a family room which was amazing in terms of size and style. Two large beds for the kids, a king size bed, two bathrooms and a big terrace. Mind the long cue for check in and that our room was not ready until 2pm (we arrived at 7am), this was an absolute fantastic stay. Try the walkway from the hotel directly to the botanical garden at night - you will not regret it! ",5,
A visit to Marina Bay Sands is a must if you‘re a tourist in Singapore. It‘s huge! We arrived a bit early knowing that check in could take long. Signs showed that check in was at Tower 1 (there are 3). Very long queues. It was nice that they gave free juices while waiting. They checked our booking confirmation while lining up and sent us to Tower 3. There was a shorter queue. Lots of questions and explanations then we finally got our Deluxe King City View on the 37th floor. Spectacular city view especially at night. The room was very spacious like a suite. The famous Infinity pool is a real tourist attraction. Entry only using the hotel room key card. Check in is at 3 pm and Check out at 11:00 am. They charge half a day room rate until 6 pm (late Check out) or whole night rate…,5,
"Great location, amazing views, sublime architecture, visionary concept.... but all this attracts a lot of people and as a hotel guest your privacy is compromised unless you don’t mind trodding along in your swim robe through “public” areas... if that does not bother you then this place is lively round the clock and fun can be had!",3,
"If you want to see the Infinity pool for free of charge, just visit the Spago rooftop bar in Tower 2. Of course you can’t swim in the pool, but you can sit very close (see pic). The prices aren’t extremely high. To come there you’ll need to change the elevator on the 55th floor. Just head to the gym and the next elevator will take you to the sky bars without hotel keycard. The room is nothing special, you can get the same quality in a 4-star hotel already. However, the city panorama is amazing and it is recommended to book the skyview ones, which are located on the upper floors.",3,
"This wonderful hotel sets a new standard for our holiday experiences.  Architecturally amazing inside and out with breathtaking beauty and thoughtfulness at every turn.  Cafes, restaurants, bars, casino, gardens and that unbelievable rooftop pool - wow.  Certainly plan & budget to spend at least a few nights in this modern wonder while holidaying in Singapore.  Only a 20 minute taxi ride from Changi Airport, 10 minutes to wonderful shopping on Orchard Road and the excitement of Sentosa Island.  We absolutely loved our holiday here 💕",5,
"That was our first time in Singapore, and of corse there is no any place more iconic than this hotel to stay. Maybe for this reason there are so many people and unfortunately the service is left behind, specially at the Skypark. Just to give you an idea how bad we were treated at the skypark, we stayed 3 days at the hotel and we went there only in first day, and stayed only for two hours. It is amazing, but just to go once.",4,
Came here for business and found rooms spacious and staff very helpful. I went to the rooftop pool and it didn’t disappoint. Spago is also really nice to cool down at night with a cold drink. There is a great breeze and great atmosphere,5,
"Stayed for one night to finish up our Singapore trip, we arrived at 11am. Our two rooms were not ready however we were given Sky/Pool passes to allow us to go up to the viewing platform and pool early and would be sent an email when the rooms were ready.   We paid for late checkout until 6pm, this is not cheap and expect to pay nearly the cost of the night. However we were willing to pay to continue to use the pool and room after the normal checkout time.   The rooms were of excellent standard with loads of technology fitted, our room had a balcony overlooking the gardens.   We felt one night was enough (with early check in and late check out) as it allowed us to soak in the atmosphere and enjoy the pool. We also used the shopping mall and casino attached to the hotel.   I…",5,
Waste of Money no 5 star service had to bring my own bag into the check counter of hotel then into my room. Take the pool away from it there is nothing good about it  The room was clean and the lady’s do a great job. It’s not worth the money ,1,
I would say that every time I come here the place just gets better when it comes to their service quality. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating. The rooftop pool is better now with more serene vibes. Stunning views of the garden and the city and I will always be in awe of this hotel.,5,
"Stayed for 6 nights at the Marina Bay Sands with my wife and 4 children. Overall a very disappointing experience. Very crowded hotel. Long queues at check in even though arrived at 6pm. Rooms requested were not available even though reservation made weeks in advance. Advised to check in to one set of rooms and that arrangements would be made to move us to the requested rooms the next day. Next day on our return to the hotel from a tour at 6pm (and another queue at the check in counter) rooms were still not allocated and had to work with counter staff until rooms made available. Long queues at breakfast with ridiculous ""check in"" process every day for breakfast. Staff too overworked to be responsive to even simple guest requirements.   One serious incident where our 14 year old…",2,
" Checkin counters so ridiculously crowded and painted in awful bright coloured design, my expectations totally deflated. The whole entry area is bigger than an airport arrivals hall and packed with tourists. Our city view Club room was fine and comfortable with the expected great views. Cleaning staff were excellent despite being so busy. Cocktails and canapés in the Level 55 room were excellent quality and quantity. Staff in this area were very friendly and provided great service. The pool area was just so jam packed I couldn't even contemplate using it for the 3 days which were intended to be r&r in Singapore. Obviously the views were amazing but soooo many people in the pool puts me off.  We breakfasted in Spago on the pool level and the food and service was once again of a…",2,
"Over priced tourist trap, everything was subpar except of course the pool, the view and the location. Rooms barely average (again, with great view) their king size bed is actually a “small queen” sized bed, when complained was told kings in Asia were actually much smaller! The only excuse to stay here is if, like me, you are working on your daughte’s Instagram game. Been there, done that!",2,
We really loved this hotel—we had a tower suite on floor 22..great views—obviously the skylark in floor 57 is amazing and a must..and breakfast at Club 55 was a highlight every day. Service from staff was first class.,5,
"The hotel and architecture and designing is wonderful,  it looked better with lovely and friendly staff, and good services, The infinity pool was so unique just may be it would be better if there was a bar just at the poolside, and the restaurants extend their working hours, that make the guests feel more comfortable and free. The best  staff that I remember is Dziauddin Mahamud in concierge. He behaved  so respectfully and friendly and explain every thing so kindly with very good mood, He  spent enough time for guiding guests.",5,
"We travel regularly to Singapore and each time my wife says let's stay at least one night at MBS, well this trip we settled for a visit to the hotel for lunch. We are used to staying in our regular hotel Holiday Inn Orchard where the service is personal and the hotel although busy there is an air of friendliness from the moment you walk in the door, this is not apparent at the MBS, the lobby looks like the departure hall of an Airport, dozens of people lined up at check inn and check out counters baggage every where, people laying about on seating, really quite a shock, such a cold impersonal lobby. Well it didn't get any better from there, the Hotel is a labyrinth of passage ways and stairs and tunnels, after asking at the coffee shop which had a lunch buffet if there were…",3,
"Be warned...check your credit cards as soon as you get home and up to a week after. We confirmed all charges with marina bay reception on departing. Then, an illegal deduction was made without our authorisation. $1600+ held in limbo for over 2 weeks. Multiple emails and international phone calls made by us to reverse the transactions and follow ups when very little was done by the hotel. Without us making contact we would not have got our money back.",1,
"I stayed a night to celebrate my partners 30th birthday and honeymoon. I notified the hotel of the occasion in advance and on checkin and they advised they would help make it extra special, but they didn’t. ",1,
"A night’s accommodation at this Resort is not cheap and apparently it is always busy. The occupancy is always very high. The structure itself is a statement and very iconic. It is a destination for many even if they are not staying a night there. Hence a very busy venue.  We booked two inter-connecting Club rooms which all comes with king beds and has a sofa bed if required. The room and he bath room ante well appointed and large. There is even a mini coffee machine in the room.   Our rooms face the bay and has excellent view but also has the afternoon sun. The sofa was very comfortable and so is the work desk tough i have been to hotels that has more expensive finishing for such high room rates.  There are minor design issue, the main ones are the interconnecting doors do not…",5,
"You can see this hotel from far away and it really sticks out. Three towers with what looks like a cruise ship on top the architecture is incredible. This is definitely a high end hotel and is very expensive to even stay a night but it’s worth it.   My family and I had a view of the gardens by the bay and we were able to watch the garden rhapsody from our room, not as great as if you were actually there, but this was very fun to watch from the comfort of our room! The rooms were not very big for how much you pay but they were good enough for what we needed.   The infinity pool on the top deck of this hotel is the best part of the entire stay. The pool has three different sections so adults are able to swim separately without any kids. The pool looks like it is flowing right off…",5,
"Nothing unique, ecxept the pool on the 57th floor and view on the Gardens by the Bay.  A lot of people in the pool, you can do only a photo not to swim. What is good - the towels always in your disposal.  Coffee in this hotel should be more tasty.",4,
"We booked 2 nights at the Sands, as our base to do a very quick tour of the city, before flying onto Thailand. The staff are all so accommodating, service oriented, and welcoming. There wasn't anything they wouldn't try and accomplish for you. The Pool / Sky deck is amazing, and swimming in the rim flow pool is an experience of a life time - swimming above the city line of the city.  The rooms are generous, well furnished, with incredible views. We had a view over the bay, and could see the Mirlion from our room, and the laser show at night.  This was a bucket list visit for us, and although way out of our budget, we are glad we saved up for this experience.",5,
"In one word - average. Average check in process. Average room. Average service. Average, average, average. Not worth the money, stay elsewhere. This hotel is trading on the name only. The rooms are tired and need to be updated. The check in process takes ages (we lined up for at least 30 minutes) and they don't even give you information about facilities etc.  The pool has a nice view, but is totally overrun by chinese tourists taking selfies.  If you want luxury in Singapore, look elsewhere.",2,
"The hotel was expensive, but it was worth every penny! Great breakfast ( yet expensive), had the best time at the world's most famous pool. The hotel is perfect. Clean, beautiful, luxurious, linked to a very expensive mall. Walking distance to some of the city's main attractions. Great wi-fi connection, awesome in every way! Going back to that hotel every night was a dream come true. I can´t wait to go to Singapore and Vlog about it on my youtube channel! Awesome! The only downside is the huge check in lines. The hotel is huge!",5,
"But I expected more you can have all the Bell's and whistle's but it's got to have a bit of heart, I found it lacking in that sense with inconsistency with staff service from exceptional to very ordinary and although I limited ourselves to eating at a few of the restaurants I'd have to say they were average with Club 55 being the better of them all, probably won't be back but if you want a selfie that's hard to beat then then infinity pool on the top floor with the Singapore skyline as a backdrop will not disappoint.",3,
"Marina Bay Sands Hotel literally has it all! the best swimming pool in Singapore at the top, the huge luxurious mall, the great casino, top notch restaurants, the beautiful Garden by The Bay and of course the amazing view from our room. I recommend you to choose the city view room because the view is amazing for real!!  The room is spacious, the staff is welcoming -I arrived at the hotel around 10 or 11 in the morning. I could not check in at that time of course but they let me have the access to go to the top floor (giant swimming pool and restaurant) and would let me know if the room is ready- and I'm impressed with that service  you haven't visit Singapore if you haven't stay or at least visit this amazing place",5,
"The architecture of this place takes your breath away. It’s stunning. From the exterior to the lobby areas, to the top deck, to the rooms. Stunning. The best stopover. We stayed in rainy and even cool weather for Singapore so unfortunately didn’t maximize the use of that gorgeous wet edge pool, but we still got in there  when a bit of blue sky appeared! The water was unexpectedly freezing though! But words can’t describe the pool experience up there, with Singapore laid out before you and all that sky...was magnificent.  The sky bar is also a must-unless raining as it’s closed then. We got one night up there. Glasses of wine start at $24 so it’s not cheap. Neither is coffee anywhere at Marina Bay-cheapest was $8. Even Starbucks was $8.40! Food is dear too.  The room was so…",5,
"One of the best hotel we ever stayed at. Considering how big this hotel is everything and everyone works so efficiently and fast. Very clean and very presented. Perfect for a relaxing holiday. Amazing views, awesome pool, great gym .... not one little thing to fault. Thank you again, we will be back 😁",5,
" MUST VISIT if you are planning a Budget friendly trip try to cut down on other activities or reduce the number of days but do not miss this property.   View from here is just mesmerising. The INFINITY POOL is just amazing, once you enter the pool and see the View from there you will forget every thing else about the trip. The view and the pool is so soothing.   They even have Jacuzzi. And all the pool are not deep at all so if you do not know to swim still you can enter the pool. The maximum Height of the Pool might be around 4 Ft.   The View from the Hotel during Night is just amazing. As the Pool is on the 57th Floor you can see the Whole Singapore City light up during Night.   We stayed here just from a Night. And we regretted that we should have taken minimum 2 Nights stays…",5,
"To look at it’s stunning and the views from it are equally unparalleled but it’s their way or the highway. Having booked an orchid suite to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary when we arrived we were offered a sea view on the 10th floor, we were told theee was nothing else available unless of course we paid more for a further room upgrade...... Anyway we had a beautiful double aspect suite right on the corner of tower 3 - luggage though took 3 hours to find its way to our rearranged room. However the pool was packed and would offer nothing other than a selfie moment - for generation narcissist - so I would definitely not recommend that. Finally this morning the final nail for me was to turn up at Spargo as the clocks turned 1030 to be told the restaurant closed at 1030.  That…",2,
"We came to stay in MBS since January to June except April 2018 monthly. There were quite a few times our rooms were being managed by a housekeeping staff named Hong-wei.  There are never short of any amenities, towels placed onto the sofa & bench are replaced daily.  Thank you Hong-wei.  My recent stayed room T1-790 (26th-30th)",5,
"Worth every penny!!! I have stayed in plenty of accommodation around the world and mbs is top notch. The rooms are huge and impressive, the staff are friendly and attentive, there's lots to do in the resort area. We got upgraded to a better room, on a higher floor with a city view which was breathtaking ",5,
"The buildings and edifices are without doubt breath taking and the location and views are unparalleled . But, that’s where it stops. The internet service is at best intermittent- in fact our four devices were constantly being noted out and we would have to keep logging in.  On complaining we were told that the system was just that and if we wanted to have access without interruption then their IT person would have to modify all of our devices? Which are all latest Apple either phones or tablets.  Of course we did not take up this option as it was absurd, we have never encountered such nonsense in any other hotel.  The next problem we encountered was the highly discriminatory policy of charging any child six and over $22 no matter what they had including a  Bowl of cereal. We can…",3,
"When visiting Singapore for the first time, this really is the best place to stay! The views over Singapore don’t get better than this, especially from the rooftop bar. But most importantly, the service in all areas in spot on, considering this is such a large hotel that is a great achievement. Would love to be back one day.",5,
"Exotic place to stay, one should not miss it. located in the center of the city, situated at 57 storey tower. the infinity swimming pool is just awesome. if you are not staying, you can purchase ticket for the view point",5,
One can spend whole day at this one Mall. Very beautifully concieved.  All brands available Food court is full of variety and quality foods.   Visitors can enjoy Venice type Gondola ride with fantastic water fall created inside the mall itself.   Must visit for any tourist or business traveler. ,5,
"Went herefor my 50th birthday trip it was everything i expected to be,the pool the room the view,even though it was busy the staff where helpful and friendly I even had a cake and wine in my room on my birthday which was nice, would definitely come back if I ever had the chance.",5,
"We had the opportunity to stay for three nights at the Marina Bay Sands recently and for me it was the once in a lifetime experience that should be on everyone's bucket list. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was one of the hilights, what a view from up there! We found that after the morning rush the pool cleared out a bit and you could easily get a lounge to park on to work on your tan or jump into one of the jacuzzis to ease the leg and back muscles after those long walks through the gardens. Andy the life guard was very helpful and friendly and ensured we had a great spot by the pool. Another hilight was having breakfast at Spargos on the 57th floor, be sure to try their eggs benedict, they are the best. We were treated with respect and friendliness by all of the staff,…",5,
"Booked directly online. I got a room with club access on a higher floor with city view. This gets you breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails/canapès. The room was quite clean with well stocked bathroom and a comfy bed. Rooms are not cheap, this was a splurge. First 2 photos show the view from the room.   Football world cup was ongoing while I was there. They offered free viewing of live games at  Club 55. 3rd photo was taken from the club room. Food at the club is good and service is excellent!  Access to the infinity pool and Skypark is free for guests. The pool can get very busy except early in the morning, as seen on the last pic. I'd recommend going before everyone else arrives.   Overall experience was good. It is just expensive for good rooms, so I can only give a 4. If…",4,
"In the month of April stayed one night in this hotel, wow what a hotel, what a swimming pool on 57th floor, our room was on tower 3 on 40th floor, there are 3 towers, our room was harbor facing so we have good view from our window, room size is very big, very good hotel. staff are very co operative, wifi has good speed, very good swimming pool, breakfast has number of varieties, for Indians has only fruits, tea, coffee, is option there is no other option for vegetarian, they have to put two / three varieties for vegetarian for Indians, over all it's very good and once in your life stay there",5,
"I stayed two nights during a family holiday. Of course, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are great, spacious, clean, loads of amenities, and the staff is friendly and helpful, everything you can expect from a 5 star hotel. The views are stunning. The infinity pool lives up to its reputation. This, is the reason why I recommend doing it once in your life. However, I think once is enough, considering the price, it's overrated.  The reason I don't give 5 stars as a rating is because of the breakfast. You get really nice views, as it's next to the infinity pool.  Taking the price (45 SGD) and the general standing of the hotel in consideration, I was expecting incredible food. It was, however, pretty disappointing. The food, was overall good, but not excellent. The dim sum were too…",4,
"As we arrived, an attendat took our luggage and gave us a pass and told us that our luggage will reach the room once we checkin.  He asked to take the urgent bag with us and rest everything will reach the room.   If you want you can keep your costumes outside and enjoy the infinity pool until the room gets ready and then go to your room and ja e shower.   The room is very spacious and pricey but it gives justice to the fortune we spent.   Mr. Terry who was front office executive was very nice and gave us a room with a beautiful view and very polite to deal with.   Then Mr Biyani came with our luggage and he was equally gentle and explained everything about the city and what all we can enjoy from the room.   The pool is mesmerising.   Everything was going great until we reached…",4,
The hotel in itself is in a great location and the infinitiy pool is pretty much where you want to spend most of your time! I just find for the price the whole place is a little overrated... if you're staying here make sure you spend as much time at the pool as you can and order a pina colada! Yum!  I would request a garden view because you get a view of Gardens By the Bay which is nice at night!,4,
We got thre late for check in and the hotel run out of the room type we booked. So they gave an ugraded one. It was 100 sqm and spotless. Looked at the bay. Spent two nights there with a toddler.  Pool an pool are was nice amd the view breathtaking especially at night time.  Service was a bit dissappointing however.,4,
"Rooms look and feel of a premium luxury hotel. Really reminds me of Crown Towers in Melbourne, Aus. Where this hotel really shines and where it stands out from the rest is the feeling of great awe as you pick up your chin from the floor as you walk through the foyer while you marvel at the buildings architecture. This continues as you proceed to check out what you came here to see and do...the roof top pool. Location is not the most convenient if you planned to be close to the city centre but this is easily solved with a taxi ride or take the train located in the shopping center that is linked to the hotel via a walkway. With also an abundance of restaurants to choose from within the hotel it was very hard to leave the hotel without any reason. Hot Tip: As suggested by my 5 yr…",5,
price to quality was inadequate; rooms not luxury; no air-condition in elevators and long queues happen; the worst was reception - not many sits when waiting; pool on a top floor nice but nothing impressing,3,
This hotel is simply superb! Location us perfect. Staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. Rooms are perfect. The infinity pool is a real highlight and worth staying here just for that!!! Food is delicious! Highly recommend!,5,
"Meant to write this review ages ago but only just got round to doing it. We actually stayed at MBS in April 2017 as part of our honeymoon, we stopped over in Singapore for 4 nights before flying on to Bali. We stayed here for only 1 night on our last night in Singapore and are so glad that we did! The hotel is out of this world, unlike anywhere we'd ever been before. The rooms are amazingly plush and luxurious with incredible views and the swimming pool really is as amazing as it looks. If you haven't already, I'd recommend watching BBC2 'Amazing Hotels: Life Beyond the Lobby'. We watched the episode on Marina Bay Sands before coming and this really set the scene for our stay. The staff are amazing, so attentive and thoughtful. The team working the pool on the day that we stayed…",5,
"Loved our 2 night stay here! To finish our trip on a high note we had booked interconnecting premier rooms that had stunning views of Gardens By The Bay on the 34th floor. We had the wonderful experience of VIP checkin, with wonderful service from all staff, including the cleaners that made cute towel animals that matched our children’s stuffed toy hippo and bear. One point to note is that the mini bar has NO space for any of your personal items. As I had medication that required refrigeration I had to pay S$10 to ‘hire’ another mini bar fridge that was delivered to the room.",5,
"From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. Special lounge for signing in if you booked a club room - really recommended. Just had to go back and ask for another room as we had no view (4th floor) and very noisy - on the highway. Roulle was great to move us to the 26nd floor. Still noisy as the hotel is next to the highway but the view was amazing - on the gardens on the bay. Room size a surprise as it was spacious and well equipped. The bed was a nice surprise - here the hotel get 10 out of 10 - a Simmonds mattress the same as ours at home !!!! O what a pleasure. The balcony fantastic to watch the lights show from Gardens across the road. The view on the ocean also magnificent. The best surprise was Club 55 where we could have breakfast, afternoon and dinner…",5,
This is a normal 5 star hotel with below average hospitality and guest service. The hotel is surviving only because of its Infinity pool. The property is undoubtedly beautiful but the guest care services are bad. . P.S- I was forced to carry my luggage from tower 1 to tower 3 which should have been done by hotel. Bell boys saw me doing that and ignored as if I was of no importance to them.,3,
"This hotel is amazing!  The best view in the city.  The nice surprise was that is in connected to the casino, tons of high end shopping and the Gardens By the Bay!  Do your self a favor, spend the extra $$ and stay here!  ",5,
Thanks for Hwee Lin Koh  She has invited me to visit One of The best hotels in Singapore.  The Marina Bay Sands !!!!   Perfect an architectural !!  Skypark stunning by the view perfect rooftop and beautiful swimming pool was very enjoyable  is the Best of the experience moment that I never forget in my life was very excited and valuable,5,
"Our family (2 adults and 2 children) had Orchard Suite which had lots of space and it offered views from 47th floor to both the city and the Gardens which was amazing experience. The club on 55th floor was very crowded in the evening canapees so you should arrive early for that. The pool area is naturally why we came and it met our expectations with a incredible views to the marina and city. There are plenty of chairs in the pool area so we found easily space to stay which was good.   Amazing experience, but a couple of days is enough to experience the key points in the hotel.",5,
The highlight of this hotel is the SWIMMING POOL..nice view and very windy but too many people. But the hotel Breakfast and dinner buffet is good .,3,
Hotel Check-In was a bit of hassle. Very long queue. Though they served refreshments while in queue. We took city view room on 25 level. View was great. We could see sound and light show from our room. City view from infinity pool at level 57 was unbelievable. On the other side of same level we saw Singapore shipyard docks.  Skypark at the same level is also a wonderful experience. It had a great view of city skyline.,5,
"Stayed four wonderful nights at this magnificent hotel, we were on floor 33, tower 3 facing gardens on the bay, rooms have balconies therefore you have a wonderful view of gardens on the bay light and music show each night the rooms are large with a great size bathroom and shower, the bed mattress was a little on the hard side but too much good for this to be a problem, and the infinity pool simply no words!!  Takes your breath away, a lifetime memory. We arrived at 6am knowing we would not get our room,there was a room available and we were in by 6.30am , thank you  Marina Bay Sands  worth the luxury stay",5,
"Stayed for 4 nights in a city view room.  Amazing facility with a great view. Room clean and tidy, bed was comfy, bathroom was massive with a great sized bath which easily fit two adults.  The hotel has a massive shopping area attached and a great array of food outlets and restaurants.  Check in time is extremely busy and the wait was long.  Given it is a huge hotel it didn't surprise me.   The rooftop pool was busy but accommodated everyone (view was spectacular), drinks were a bit pricey end but not unreasonable.  Room service was prompt and the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Loved that the hotel had a connecting walk bridge to Gardens by the bay which is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore.  Iconic hotel which I highly recommend.",5,
My fiancé and I stayed here for 1 night mainly because of the rooftop pool which was spectacular. The views are incredible and worth the price alone. It wasn’t overcrowded which was a surprise but that might change day to day. There is an adult only section which was a bonus. Drinks are expensive but what you would expect for the view. The room was large with comfortable bed and amazing views out to the city and the bay. Connected to the metro and walking distance to gardens by the bay. For a quick and inexpensive meal go to the food court in the mall. I would recommend splurging on this hotel just for the pool and would say one night was enough.,5,
"Visited here on business for a conference and have to say it is an incredible place but, it’s huge and as a result, it’s totally impersonal. It was spotlessly clean, the staff were friendly, my room was great, views from pool incredible but, when you stay in a lot of hotels for business, the ones that keep you coming back are those that know you by name. I suspect, unless you spend hundreds of thousands with them, you won’t get that kind of connection here. If work send me there again i’ll go but it’s not going to be top of my list.",4,
"My daughter and I spent an evening at the bar and after not having a gin drink since I was 22 years old, the bartender made me one that was more than magnificent. No gin test, just pure lovely tasting drinks with exceptional flavor. They also serve the most incredible macaroni and cheese I’ve ever tasted. The bar menu is fabulous. A must for a visit and certainly a stay at the hotel if you can swing it.",5,
"Don't get me wrong... the hotel was good.  Outdoor appearance. Grand. Lobby. Nothing special. Room was neat Infinity Pool was FANTASTIC. Buffet dinner at the Ground Floor was INCREDIBLE.  Biggest Asset in customer service... Filipino Staff.  Prestige in the stay was there. All my friends & relatives were like wow... yayamanin ang hotel mo  Yes i enjoyed the room n the location.  On promo basis, id probability.  ",3,
"Wife and i had 4 nights stay at MBS which was a gift from an uncle and of course we were excited. I am Singaporean and all my reviews have been either 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, MBS fell short of my expectations. The room was decent , spacious and had good amenities. Tv channels were distorted at times and wifi was slow. The views were great (marina barrage, gardens by the bay, marina bay golf course )and of course the infinity pool is a must visit. However , thats about as good as it gets at MBS. Being in a service industry myself, i expect top notch service at a 5 star hotel , but this was not the case at MBS. This all started on the first night and we tried to get a car park coupon for the next day since we parked overnight and the max parking fee is $26 as compared to…",2,
Stayed in for 2 nights at MBS and the view at the pool is awesome. The food and bar is great too! The shopping was also beyond what one can ever ask for. Be sure to try out the gondola boat ride with your family or partner too.,5,
One of the most amazing resort pools out there. Rooms are a bit dated but well maintained and equipped. F&B options can be a bit limited considering the size of resort. Adjoining mall offers high end shopping and multiple dining options. ,5,
One of the engineering marvel in SG. This has the laser show in the evening which is a part of spectra water light show. Has a rooftop bar and restaurant as well. Looks beautiful from Fullerton bay hotel end during the evening.,4,
Certainly an eye opener...glad i stayed once but probably wont stay again..wiifii was terrible..very impersonal but you expect that being such an enormous place...it certainly is a must to do once in your life time..roof top pool is breathtaking..best to go mid morning..rooms are  nice..be careful if u take anything out of mini bar..even if u dont use it they charge you so best to get them to take things out if u want room for your own things.,4,
The hotel is an impressive landmark in the sky of Singapore. It has good rooms and of course an unbelievable pool. The issue is that the hotel has become a touristic attraction on his own and you need to queue everywhere behind groups of tourists on holiday. The pool is off-course crowded daily with people taking selfies. Queues for breakfast or diner can be impressive too at certain time. it really lacks personalized service for such a price,3,
"We stayed there for one night and really enjoyed it. The pool was pretty crowded, especially around sunset as people wanted to get photos. Nevertheless, it was a beautiful view and I really enjoyed the stay,",5,
"Stayed 1 night to celebrate birthday and wedding anniversary. Had to wait a while to check in but front desk staff's professionalism and friendliness made up to it. Already a great impression to start with!  Delighted to see our room nicely decorated with towel swans and flower petals. Room is spacious and clean.   Housekeeping we met at the corridor always greet us with a smile. In fact every staff we interacted with are professional.   Had an awesome time in the infinity pool, great view. But felt that the water was too cold.  Thank you MBS, we had a memorable stay.",5,
"Stayed 4nights, on Level 39 in a City View room. Main reason was to experience the infinity pool, which was worth every penny spent! Highly recommend going first thing in the morng, watch the sunrise in the jacuzzi and take in the city views as it gets brighter in the pool! Also get in a night swim as the experience is quite different to the morng. As for the hotel itself, it was everything if not more than what we expected. Room was very spacious, with a comfy bed, great toiletries, and amazing room service. We had in room dining on our arrival as we didn’t get in till close to midnight, and the service was so impeccable, we had to have it again on our last night. Explored the hotels shopping mall & the gardens & the museum and all were just absolutely amazing! Definitely a…",5,
"When I was picked up by my driver to take me to the airport he asked me what I thought of my stay there. I told him I would never stay there again as the place had no class. He told me that nearly every person he picks up from there has the same comment. This place was expensive, but the room was small compared to other hotels. When we went to breakfast in ""Adrift"" on our first morning we all agreed that the food was very ordinary. I asked for Eggs Benedict and was provided with Eggs Norwegian and the eggs had obviously been prepared much earlier and had not been properly defrosted, they were still partially frozen. This was indicative of every thing at this place. The skypool was accomodating so many people it was uncomfortable to be in the pool. There were just too many…",1,
Stayed for 2 nights it’s one of the best experience I ever had.  Sky park is an awesome experience and is very popular  They have very nice & spacious room right opposite to Garden by the Bay the view from the room is breathtaking.  Hotel is connected to Marina mall you can enjoy amazing shopping experience here.  Overall 5 stars to this place.,5,
"It is a good choice to stay in Singapore Marina Bay Sands Hotel when you go to Singapore. The hotel is very luxurious and there is a rooftop infinity swimming pool! I can see all the beautiful views while swimming. There is a garden near the hotel. The rooms of Marina Bay Sands Hotel feels great, and the main lobby has a big shopping centre. When you go there, you must try the food that they have; it is very delicious. The hotel has got almost everything you want! The hotel will reflect a few laser lights in the sky at night. If you want to take a good rest in Singapore, you should go!",5,
"If you have the money, definitely go for the experience in MBS, it will not go wrong. Its small wonder that many regard the hotel to be the best in South East Asia.  Highlight is the Infinity Pool with its breathtaking view and experience, though it can be a little crowded at times.",5,
"Recently stayed for 3 nights on my honeymoon when visiting Singapore for a city break.   The hotel itself looks amazing, both from the outside and inside.   The rooms are huge! Beds comfortable and all in very good condition. We were lucky to get a city view which was amazing.   The infinity pool is also well worth the stay here.   However, this is a 5 star hotel...but lacks 5 star service.   From the moment I got out my cab, a gentleman grabbed my bags and said he would take them up to our rooms. In most 5 star hotels, that’s complimentary of the price...but not here. It was lucky I spotted the small sign over near the valet desk which says there is a charge for someone to take your bags up for you. I politely declined, but most people probably have missed that sign and got hit…",3,
"A once in a life time experience, totally worth it, superb room with amazing furnishings and elevated appliances and amazing view, the infinity pool is great with a view to die for all day long, food is amazing. Everything was really on point, will never forget this place. Staff are really friendly, special thanks to Mark the bell man. ",5,
"What an incredible experience we had at Marina Bay Sands. The best Hotel I have ever stayed in my life (comes with the price though). We planned to stay for 1 night in a Deluxe room, unfortunately I cannot comment on the room because we were UPGRADED for FREE to the Presidential Suite!!!! We felt like Celebs. The room views were breathtaking. Best to say we hardly left the room the entire duration of our stay, and if we did it was to head up to the pool which was equally amazing. I know it is pricey but you have to say here for the experience.",5,
"The air con in the rooms was faulty which led to a uncomfortable nights sleep. Plus the much vaunted infinity pool is stone cold too. Overall a physically cold and soulless mega hotel which is not worth the premium. If this is luxury you can shove it, I had a far more comfortable and better value for money stay at the Holiday Inn, Orchard Centre just beforehand.",2,
We did not stay here but wanted to enjoy the view from this stunning building at night. Go to tower three and head up the 57th floor for a cocktail and just be amazed at views of nighttime Singapore. The drinks are expensive but its something you don't do everyday and well worth the experience.The service good and very friendly and the views outstanding. This is a closed off area and you cannot access the pool area but you can see it all.,4,
"I had a great time swimming in their infinity pool with friends , I enjoyed the jacuzzi and the city view the most. The breakfast and the dinner were awesome, the complimentary toiletries were so good and lastly the attendant were gracious and warmth, definitely a worthy experience to share with my friends and love ones explicit to those who wants to visit singapore.",5,
"From the main lobby, we just go straight to Tower 3. We decided to just buy CÉ LA VI voucher of SGD20, where we can spend the voucher to buy drinks & food at the bar, instead of buying a SGD23 for the observation deck. The bar is also located at the rooftop. You can choose to sit with the city view or the sea view. We chose the city view, grab a couple drinks, took photos, then move to the area with sea view. We didn't buy anything in here, just went there to see the view. I think the dresscode is just smart casual, but maybe there's some rules if they held an event. You don't have to think about the dresscode if you choose to buy tickets for the observation deck though.",5,
"WOW, WOW, WOW - this place is amazing!  We arrived on a budget, with just one night in Singapore and a goal to swim in the pool at the top of the Marina Bay Sands complex.  On checking it out online, learnt that only hotel guests are allowed to swim in the pool, so I had to find a way.  We arrived to a calvacade of Ferraris at the front door which looked amazing, and then proceeded to check in to our $400+ per night room - on the third floor!  Clearly the rooms are priced based on the level they are on and I didn't care, I just wanted to see that pool.  The first thing we did was head to the roof, where I did get to swim in that amazing pool.  But there was so much more!  I had never seen a shipping dock like the one in Singapore.  Crazy amounts of container ships all doing this…",5,
"We stayed here for one night (family vacation). We had a really great time here. The rooms were very comfortable, the staff was incredibly polite and accommodating. We had multiple rooms and had requested if we could get them in the same floor. The staff definitely helped us with that and got us rooms next to each other. The view from the rooms overlooked the super trees, which was spectacular. We used the swimming facilities and explored the inter-connected mall as well. The breakfast buffet was something else entirely, with tons of choices to accommodate for everyone. We were very happy with our stay here.",5,
"I have seen many friends taking pictures in the MBS infinity pool and uploading it to social media. I thought it would be one of those overrated things but I decided to give it a go anyways and boy was I glad I did it. The views are AMAZING! and I highly recommend jumping in the infinity pool during daytime and during nighttime because they are both very different. For the price, I *might* do it again for a very special occasion and if I have a longer stay in the country because there are more to Singapore than just the infinity pool.",5,
"We stayed here for a stay-cation and had a wonderful time.  The room was spacious, with a great view over the Super Trees and harbor.   But the real highlight was the rooftop infinity pool with is so iconic in tourist photos of Singapore.",5,
"The hotel has the standard of any 5 star hotel in the world. What is really interesting about this place are the views, specially from the rooms and from the top of the building, where the pool is located. It is a must when in Singapore.",5,
"We stayed here for three nights whilst celebrating my birthday. Amazing hotel with incredible views, the room was just gorgeous with huge bath and separate shower. Large room with everything you need.  Perfect base for all the attractions.  Hotel is very busy but smoothly run.  The only downside was the torrential rain that decided to appear the morning we went upstairs to the pool, but still loved it. ",5,
was thrilled by the view of the hotel! service was perfect and people were happy :) hotel amenities were very good and was worthy! the bars at the rooftop were awesome too I will visit that place again :D,5,
"It does not matter how long you are in Singapore for, you must visit this hotel. it looks magnificent from a distance and just gets better as you get nearer. You do have to pay to go up to the roof gardens, but the view is well worth every penny. We went just before sunset, so benefited from day light and evening views.  Unfortunately only residents are allowed in the pool area, but if you walk all the way around to the caffee, you do get a view of it due to the curved nature of the viewing platform. A very good place to watch the evening light show from marina botanical gardens, although you do not get to hear the music.  It is also worth spending some time in the atrium, which is free to walk through.",5,
"We stayed for 8 day and had a great time, although the hotel is large and busy the staff are always helpful and the service impecable. The view from the pool deck is stunning especially as the sun sets over the city. The rooms are very well maintained that the room staff do a great job.",5,
"Stay in this hotel many many2 times since it open. Never swim in the invinity pool🤣, if you are traveling solo with family or kids there are tons of activity to fullfill their needs. Let say that this hotel will cater to every need and all the staff are so friendly and dedicated to hotel guest.  The last 2 or 3 last visit I found that there are more and more staff fluent in mandarin but poor in english, no big deal since there are planty staff who cud assist you. Cud be because tourist from mainland probably the highest visitor to Singapore. Other thing that may be as a hotel with international 5 star diamond status may be you could do something with tourist group non hotel guest to be more calm not shouting since it is really bothering other hotel Guest. But this only a minor…",5,
Check in was very busy and took about 20 mins in which time staff provided free ice cream to waiting guests. Hotel entrance is large and clean. We had sky-view rooms in tower 3 (4508 & 4408). Views of city were amazing and you could watch the 15min marina bay night time light show perfectly from your room. Rooms were large with comfortable beds. Toilet clean with good powerful shower.  Infinity rooftop pool is amazing with spectacular views. Was very busy on the Saturday so sun loungers were difficult to obtain if you are not there early.  Plenty rooftop bars and poolside service for food and drink. Poolside burgers were excellent but restaurant menus were limited & food overpriced in our opinion.  Skywalk has brilliant views of city and marina bay and rooftop bars at night are…,4,
We have been to Singapore many times and just visit the restaurants in marina bay but stayed there this time  Was well worth it and the business lounge fantastic for an afternoon graze and a few drinks We’ll be back at the rooftop lounge was great to unwind,5,
"It was very expensive but it was worth the money for the one night just so we could experience all the wonderful amenities and facilities offered by the hotel.  We were able to walk through the shopping mall, have a great meal in the many restaurants and cafe's and the infinity pool and Spago for breakfast was one of the highlights.",4,
"Try swimming on the roof top infinity pool what a view of the surrounding skyscrapers. The best time to try this is at 6.00am just as it opens and if you are lucky you may be on your own for 10 minutes ! The roof top is the best place for breakfast.Superb range of food on offer,and a gentle breeze.For dinner try the fine Dining Restaurant also on the roof ,you need to book in advance.Probably the best food I have ever tasted. The rooms are superb also,with a big shower,and a heck of a drop from the window. What a fabulous hotel and experience. Hotel to stay,not cheep.",5,
"Stayed there for three nights. It was a really nice experience, but expensive. The people working here in both reception and the restaurants were really friendly and attentive. The food we ate was really good. The rooms were clean but seems a bit old. Maybe they need some refurbishing soon. But we had a great stay and would definitely stay there again. The only negative thing is that it felt overcrowded. Really touristy hotel.",4,
"The Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel right on the marina in Singapore.  The stunning view from the infinity swimming pool does not disappoint.  The rooms are elegant and the property amenities top notch.  The attached casino and mall are great places to unwind, grab something to eat or spend your winnings.  If you are visiting Singapore, a few night at the Marina Bay Sands is a must.",4,
"I have stayed in hotels all around the world and the Marina Bay Sands is up there with the  best, if not THE very best.   We have just spent 8 days here for our Wedding Anniversary & our first trip to Singapore and from the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted and made to feel welcome.   The hotel is certainly impressive in size and design, an iconic building right on Marina Bay. We arrived around 5:00pm and check-in was swift & efficient, our luggage arriving in our room shortly after we did.   We booked a Premier Room with a view over the Gardens by the Bay. The room was spacious, comfortable and immaculately clean. The bed was fantastically comfy and the bathroom was great. Amazing views from the balcony too!   There were great restaurants in the hotel (Rise,…",5,
"We were in SG for my mom's birthday and we decided to stay at MBS for one night. Even though the rate per night is expensive, the hotel surely lived up to its reputation. It's very luxurious, clean and although it was a bit crowded during check-in, the staff were very hospitable and offered a lot of snacks and drinks while we're waiting. We were upgraded to a premier room with a harbour view which was another bonus to this stay. The highlight though was the infinity pool on the 57th floor. The view at night and in the morning is very memorable.",5,
"As many other people pointed out, this hotel is massive. Most tourists come from China but also Indonesia and increasingly India.  Probably during a normal period we would have given it 4/5 stars but it was a long weekend in China and the hotel was fully booked.  Positives are location: Bay Garden is stunning, rooms are modern, spacious and functional. We loved the breakfast in Spago (57-th floor outside). Service is good   Negatives is very crowded. Didn’t even want to try the pool. Also the breakfast queues are not acceptable at this level.  I can easily imagine that it is great family hotel (for children)   Next time we will try Fullerton Bay. ",3,
"We almost didn’t book this hotel having heard it’s super touristy. Yes it is but that doesn’t detract from what it offers and we were so glad we stayed here. The facilities, the rooms, the staff, the afternoon tea & THE POOL is all amazing, plus so much more. Close to the botanical gardens which are a must see and close to the bay.  Oh and the light show the hotel puts on every night is fantastic.  We would go back.",5,
"To give you the one slight disappointment upfront - the sky pool is overrated. We went in for the picture, took it and left. Pool gets very crowded and hard to get a sun bed. But then, what do you expect in such a big hotel ? Everything else was just awesome. The rooms are nice and spacious. Staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. The restaurant choices are vast and while we had every intention to eat out, we always stayed in the hotel. “Lavo” was a highlight, stunning views, stunning views and very friendly staff. We’ll definitely be back.",5,
Marina Bay Sands (not Marina Bay) has one of the cleanest toilets I've ever seen (apart from the ones at Changi Airport and at home). Kudos to the cleaners!,5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful complex not to be missed in Singapore.Iconic to Singapore’s skyline is an architectural marvel with environmentally sustainable features and advanced design concepts An infinity pool on the 57th floor has a view of the Singapore skyline. The complex houses the Theatres and it's a world class leading entertainment destination where the stars come to play. Besides the hotel, the shops around the complex caters to late night shopping any day of the week at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is 1 of Singapore’s largest luxury shopping malls. You will find a refreshing mix of international luxury brands and emerging labels in runway and street style. Go on a gastronomic adventure with the exciting lineup of dining options, ready to whet your appetite.",5,
"My mum and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) a week ago and on reflection we feel disappointed. Prior to our arrival I had emailed MBS to confirm their check in times. The booking confirmation conflicted, one document saying between 12-3pm and others saying 3pm. We were told in an email reply it was 3pm. I also asked about use of shower facilities after check out as we had a late flight home, we were told that we could use the showers in the gym. When we arrived at 3pm the lobby was surprisingly quiet considering all guests check in at 3pm. The check in experience felt rushed and impersonal. The instructions regarding the WiFi and the check out process were very rushed. When I asked again about shower facilities post check out I was then told the gym was being refurbished…",3,
"Stayed here with my girlfriends for 4 nights in a Grand Club room. We love to stay Club for that extra treat. Club facilities here are good but not fantastic. Unfortunately there is no dress code, apart from not being allowed to wear robes, swimmers or gym gear. It’s lovely to get dressed up and have a few drinks. People were allowed in wearing shirts and thongs. Such a shame as it ruins the ambiance of a place. I can not fault the food or drink service, all staff remembered our names and the views from the 55 th floor are spectacular. It does get a bit noisy and over crowded at times., again making it a little less special. I would still return.",4,
"From the minute we stepped into MBS we were treated like royalty!   We were greeted by someone who guided us to the VIP check in desk. Check in was very quick and efficient, our room was even ready for us to check into at 12pm ahead of the scheduled check in time of 3pm so I would recommend trying to check in as early as you can so you can make use of the facilities.   The hotel itself is spotless and the same goes for the rooms too. We were taken back when we walked into our room... It was amazing! From the size of the room / bathroom, the amazing views, the toiletries provided, to the little touches such as the towel decorations that the housekeeping staff had made. This was definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in!   The main reason we chose to stay here was for the…",5,
"Actually 3 sticks but I wanted to allude to the American expression that uses another similar sounding word with negative connotations instead of ‘ship’. From the outside, the Marina Bay Sands is an architectural icon.  Truly unique and impressive.  Sadly that is where it stops.   The hotel is comprised of three towers that support this impressive ship like structure.  And it is massive, there is an infinity pool, several bars and restaurants and observation decks. Unfortunately every time we tried to visit - and it is restricted to guests who have a room key card so if there are two of you you each need to have your own key - it was packed and chaotic.  Perhaps they use the key requirement to try and keep the crowds down.  It doesn’t work.  No ambiance here unless you enjoy…",2,
Coolest hotel we have ever stayed in. Room was very very clean and nice with amazing city view. Infinity pool is worth to visit. would defonately stay here again if visit singapore. Love it every minute of our stay.,5,
"Absolutely loved my stay here at marina bay, Firstly our room was amazing it was huge! With and amazing view of the Merlion Park then our bathroom was gorgeous with a lovely bath tub with a view of gardens by the bay.  The infinity pool was amazing absolute picturesque.  Then at night being a guest you can visit the sky park with no extra charge and the view is breathtaking all the lights at night are stunning.  I would defiantly recommend you spend at least one night at this hotel if you’re in Singapore ",5,
"My boyfriend and I rounded off a year of travelling by treating ourselves to a suite in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.   On arrival we were shown into a private check in lounge to save queuing and we were upgraded to the next level which meant we ended up with a huge room, 2 balconies overlooking the bay, and even had a pool table!   We loved the pool deck which is so relaxing day and night. The view is spectacular and swimming so high up is a little surreal but so nice. There are jacuzzi tubs to soak in as well. It can be busy at time but whatever time we went up there we always managed to get a sun lounger.   We also made use of lots of the restaurants/bars at the hotel and these were all wonderful.   It is well worth paying the extra money to get Afternoon tea, cocktails and…",5,
"This hotel is on another level entirely, there aren't enough stars or diamonds to rate the magnificence of this place.  Everything is top notch.  The service, the rooms, the dining options, the entertainment, the gardens, the pool, the list goes on and on!  This is not just a hotel, it's more like a city within itself!  The hotel sits on top of a mall and casino and there is the world's largest and highest infinity pool at the very top.  Not to mention the gardens which literally look like the world of Pandora from Avatar which are right outside of the hotel and most of the rooms have incredible views of them from the rooms.  The list goes on and on about how incredible this luxury hotel is and although it does come at a steep price, it is worth it just to experience it for…",5,
"Spent a couple of days here, have stayed before and the results always the same. A great hotel located within Marina Bay. While not cheap, by any means it does offer a lot . It is a destination location, with Singapore at its doorstep.  Very nice rooms and services, a wonderful unique roof top deck which spans across three towers. Views unequaled in the city.   Has great food choices within the hotel and complex and even more within steps. I really like Cut By Wolfgang Puck a  Michelin Star rated restaurant. The lobby and common areas are great really nothing negative to say here. Sands built and great resort.",5,
"The Marina Bay is a huge modern hotel.  It is in a beautiful setting. We booked in, was upgraded but put into a smoking room in error.  The hotel rectified the problem and moved us to another non smoking room.  The hotel then gave us a bowl of fruit and chocolates as an apology which was great. Of course the pool is amazing, it does get very busy and can be difficult to have a swim as most people in the pool are taking 'selfies'.   Staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfasts were amazing.   Very easy to get around Singapore, there is an MRT very close.",4,
"My wife and I along with another couple from the UK had a fabulous and most enjoyable stay.  Everything was just perfect.  Great service, beautiful property, good food etc.  Looking forward to a return visit with my children. ",5,
"Well this was a planned vacation to stay in marina bay sands for my daughters 13th birthday. Check in was smooth and i did get a early check too on a busy day. Took the room on the 47th floor with a view of the harbour. Excellent room and it was really large when we compare with any of the hotels in Singapore. The In room services was excellent. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was amazing and its an experience even though you dont swim too much...The restaurants in the hotel was amazing, initially thought it would be expensive, but to our surpise it was fine and they charged as any 5 star hotels would. Lavo - was the place were we celebrated my daughters 13th birthday and the food was excellent. So this hotel overall, we should not look for the money spent, rather have an…",5,
"I wanted to see this hotel and stay in the pool.  Arrived at 12 noon and went to the pool.  Could no get a seat anywhere and hitting into the pool. No way. Overcrowded. My tip is have a early night and wake at 5 am to be first in pool at 6am. There was nobody In it till 7am.  Watch the singapore sunrise in the pool, then shower and breakfast. Tick off the bucket list. Over priced and over rated hotel. Well worth it for the pool. ",4,
"Let's make it short : there are no place like the Marina Bay Sands infinity pool, and would it only be for a quick swim with a stunning view on the skyline, this place is a complete blast. Hospitality wise : it's big. Big rooms, big bathrooms, big lobby, big restaurants... and a certain feeling of being a number among numbers, but hey ? What did you expect ?",5,
"For the price, you're paying for a beautiful room, good service, the central location, a comfy bed, infinity pool and facilities, and AMAZING VIEWS.  You can find something more worth your money if you cross some of those things off your list for sure. But if you want it all, this is the place to throw your money away. ",5,
"We were treated to a night here for my birthday and certainly enjoyed our stay. The rooms are large and very comfortable, with everything one could need. The view over Gardens by the Bay were amazing. The rooftop infinity pool is stunning, with the most amazing views over the city. The drinks are very expensive, as one would expect. Check in was fairly quick and the staff friendly, efficient and helpful.",5,
"Saw this hotel on Best Hotels in the World on TV.  Had to stay and was not disappointed!  It is very expensive but the rooms are high tech and big with amazing views.  Our room over looked the Light Garden which plays twice per night.  Go into the botanical garden for a closer look!  The hotel is massive with a huge mall (open all night) and three towers.  upon check-in they offer you water and an ice cream! (nice touch) The SKy deck or rooftop pool is like no other!  It is amazing and constantly being cleaned.  We never had a problem getting a pool chair and the poolside service is top notch! Great drinks, limited food options but there are so many places to eat nearby.",5,
"Excellent view, wonderful service, great rooftop pool and verry clean. Highly recommend this place to stay when you are in Singapore. Easy access to the tourist places. The staff so helpful, ready to explain in every single question you asking about. Will definitely stay in this hotel when we will be in Singapore next time. Welldone",5,
An incredible hotel. Great views. Connected to a huge shopping centre with multiple food choices ranges from low to high in price. It is a focal point of Singapore with an outstanding view of the city.,5,
"Me and my husband stayed in MBS hotel for a night, for the price of it, it is actually EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. Honestly it’s like any other hotel room, the basic bed, bathroom... the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and equipped with all enmities, no complaints there... the hotel is connected to the mall, hence its easy to look for dining places. The only highlight is the INFINITY POOL which overlooks the whole city as it’s located at the 57th floor... there are a few lounges on the 57th floor; there is Lavo, Spago’s and Ce La Vi... overall staying in MBS is once in a lifetime experience for the sake of it. That’s about it. ",4,
"Excellent service and cleanliness, the view from the room was incredible! The highlight was access to the pool area, very busy but brilliant! We booked a restaurant through the room and were not disappointed.",5,
"This is an excellent super 5 star hotel in Singapore. Staff at reception took 5 minutes until my turn came to checked in . Check in was 2:00 pm and checked out was 12:00pm NO WAY to stay after , restaurant was so tasty. Location is near by every thing walkable and connected to a big shopping mall. The most exciting me is the top 57 floor and my deluxe room which was 4815 which  were unbelievable. Top roof 57 was the huge swimming pool was amazed , beautiful skyline and ocean view from top . Wooooooooow . Thanks  ",5,
"After watching the Netflix segment of Amazing Hotels about MBS, my wife and I were determined to experience MBS for ourselves. When United offered a great price on a nonstop to Singapore, we just couldn’t resist booking our trip.   We absolutely had our expectations exceeded in almost every way here at this truly AMAZING hotel. The staff overall was very accommodating. When we had one issue, the management apologized with a bottle of champagne.  The rooms are outstanding. We suggest asking for the bay side view. Without a doubt, the iconic swimming pool is quite a thrill. The restos and bars were good, the shopping was better than the best Vegas had to offer.   Thank you, Mr Adelson, for creating a once in a lifetime resort property!",5,
"It was a great vacation together with my family.It was our first time in singapore and with this hotel just to see and experience the famous infinity pool.As we get our room and we are excited to go swimming,we are not aware that we need to have all the card to enter.My mother who was quite old cannot enter coz we are short of card.I spoke to the staff who is at the gate if he can allow and will not swim at all.He get my room number and verified as he allow us,for that moment i am really happy and overwhelmed with the kind gesture of him.I am super thankful to the staff and i of course i get his name.Thank you James for giving us an opportunity to enjoy the pool with my family and kids..Thumbs up...",5,
"This is a true great hotel , but very expensive . 26$ standard a cocktail. $18 a beer. The pool is amazing which you can’t get to unless you staying.  They really don’t cater for you if you don’t eat meat , if you’re vegan or plant based, you have sadly no chance . Asia is built on meat dishes , try and explain your plant based and you will get a strange look 👀.  Great hotel bangin pool Be prepare to go hungry ",3,
"The hotel with its remarkable architecture offers magnificent views from the rooftop and from rooms at higher levels. However, there is nothing special about the rooms at levels 15 and below - just a standard 4 star room without views but with traffic noise if your room us located at the garden side. These rooms are highly overpriced. Complimentary internet is slow and is way below standard for a hotel of this class. Rooftop swimming pool offers fantastic views but is generally crowded. Everything is ridiculously overprized.",3,
Stayed here for four nights whilst my husband was on a conference. The staff were pleasant enough but because of the size it’s very impersonal. The pool area amazing but was very crowded. The Spago Restaurant was excellent and service was great. The rooms were ok but nothing special.,3,
"This is an exceptional hotel and if you're in Singapore you have to stay. I was in an Orchard Suite and I was definitely impressed. The view was stunning and their roof top pool is just out of this world. Room service was very professional and tasty. Only problem, my Nespresso machine in the room didn't work. I was meant to report this on checkout but forgot. ",5,
"This was my second visit to Singapore and during the last part of our stay, we stayed in majestic and grandeur Marina Bay Sands.   As we were about to enter the hotel, a staff greeted and helped us with our luggage. Upon entering the hotel, I could feel what a massive and luxurious property it is. There were multiple long queues for check in but the process was very quick and swift so it did not take much time. The staff was smiling, pleasant and amiable.  Our room was on 42nd floor and as soon as we entered the room, we were in complete amazement. What a huge room it was ! French window in the room or I should say the glass wall provided such a fabulous view of the city from the room.  The washroom was also substantially big and beautifully done up. All the accessories,…",5,
"This hotel is amazing and worth staying at while in Singapore. However be warned do not do anything with the front desk as they are totally incompetent.  Eight of us flew over from Australia for a surprise birthday and marriage proposal. The hotel did not provide the birthday request as paid for & reinforced in about 5 emails, rather they took it upon themselves to put ""will u marry me"" on the bed in rose petals in the unexpected couple's room on the day we arrived!  U can imagine the utter shock we all got when this was not what we had paid for / asked for and all of this ruined the weekend and all other plans the groom had planned for his proposal during his stay in Singapore. What a costly mistake - if the groom had wanted to put petals on a bed surely we could have done this…",1,
"This hotel is a must visit hotel! The infinity pool at the top is worth all the hype, and I’d definitely stay there again when I’m in Singapore! The service is excellent, and everyone goes out of their way to be helpful. There’s a bit of a wait to check in, but the rooms are impeccable and just very comfortable. The mall is great for additional dining options and you can work off the extra calories by talking a walk in the Gardens by the Bay. A special thank you to the staff by the pool who were very kind and personable, and kept the drinks flowing. Great job, MBS! If you can afford it, you simply have to stay at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore!",5,
"As many others have said, it’s the pool that makes the hotel. The hotel itself is very grand and upmarket (you get what you pay for) but we only stayed one night.   Once you’ve had the obligatory selfies and photos in the infinity pool then it’s just a hotel with good views from your room which is clean and a little upmarket. We were surprised that the food wasn’t too overpriced nor were the drinks. The hotels in a great location for the gardens by the bay and the other activities around that end of Singapore.   We also left tea really late and tried to find somewhere open (it was around midnight/1 am) I wouldn’t recommend the food hall as there was one place open and it didn’t look great. After falling out with one another (both ‘hangry’) we decided to go back to the room and…",5,
"I have always been impressed by MBS Hotel's infrastructure but thought the service provided was slightly clinical. However this stay totally changed my impression of your service provider. My husband fell down and cut his hand prior to arriving at the hotel. While queuing up to check-in, your staff Kateline See, who happened to walk by, noticed & asked about his well being and offered to render him First Aid. My husband was very impressed with Kateline's ability to spot his minor injury even though we don't need any first aid because it was just a superficial wound.  Furthermore, Kateline noticed my 2 year old son was getting restless during the check-in process & proactively distracted him while we were handling the check-in administration. It was a timely intervention as we…",5,
"Spent the first few days of out 10 day Singapore family holiday at Marina Bay Sands, while the hotel itself was ‘nice’ particularly the rooftop pool 👍, the location is far from ideal. It’s location means you are severely restricted for food options, which means price is high and variety is limited. The Gardens are right next door but my personal recommendation is head to Orchard Rd as a base then travel via the highly efficient MRT rail system to take in the tourist sights - The Gardens, Santosa etc.",3,
"Yes this hotel is very pricy. Honestly, one time stay is good enough for me. This hotel is one of the largest I've ever stayed in. Yes, expect crowds but I was fortunate to get to check in at the lounge, which was faster. There's 4 places to choose your breakfast; that's how large it is.   Pros: -great location. Infinity pool, skypark, shopping mall, all within access. But Merlion is a 20 minute walk away. -fast checkin at the lounge -they said tower 1 breakfast at the ground floor is the best of the 4 options  Cons:  -get ready for crowds. Everybody always going to the infinity pool and skypark.  -if you go through the regular check in, the wait time could be 15 minutes.",4,
"Wonderful view and attentive staff! We will definitely be returning. We went to Spago and Ce La Vie, the food and drinks were a bit pricey, but the experience was well worth it! A definite must see for anyone visiting Singapore.",5,
It is expensive to book (prices change everyday) but was worth it. Was surprised tho that after paying so much even wifi was not fully available (just 2 hrs) lol. Booked this purely for the pool and the views and they were amazing! Our room was overlooking Gardens by the Bay so as a bonus could watch the show from above. ,4,
"My first time visit Marina Bay Sands, very convenience location with many choice of food and restaurant. I stay in the room with sea view. Staff are friendly and only shortfall is the podium downstair is quite noisy and noise thru maindoor. Overall very good experience. Recommend to everyone.",4,
"I can’t praise this hotel enough, me and my wife stayed here for a few days in an Orchid suite and had the most wonderful time. Marina Bay Sands is possibly the greatest place I have ever stayed. From check in to check out Marina Bay Sands supplied that endless perfection you feel when in Singapore. Everything’s thought out, everything’s brilliant and you leave wanting to stay more nights. 100% I’ll stay here again , an amazing hotel in an amazing city. ",5,
"We stayed in Tower 3 for the day, to be honest, just like like everyone else, to check out the infamous pool. The pool is completely AMAZING btw and is a once in a lifetime experience!   We were able to check in early and thus enjoyed the pool at midday (it's quieter then because most people haven't checked in yet). By sunset, the pool is extremely busy.   Most people stay for the pool, it's an expensive stay but we enjoyed our time there. The rooms are large, modern and well cleaned, nothing too special (most good 4* and 5* hotels are a similar standard). Ask for a room overlooking the Gardens at the Bay - a much better view!   The hotel is really busy by the way, so if you don't like that, avoid.   Would love to stay again, but couldn't justify it to just to check out the pool…",4,
"It was my first time to visit this hotel and i'm so impressed with the architectural design of this building.reception was so busy and people are waiting in the line to get the room.Managed to get an early check-in with the very polite staff at reception. My room was so huge and very nice view from the garden.Go to the pool at sunset and the entrance is managed by the attendant.I just remembered his name, James who is very friendly, polite and accomodating, greeted me with the smile.It was quite busy at the moment and managed to relaxed by the view.Observing other staff that is walking and clearing some towels that are left by the guest to give way to other guest as well.Nice food at the hotel,and i enjoy my dinner at Sea Blue. Will definitely comeback.",5,
"This visit I had the best experience ever, I had stayed before at many luxury hotels, but this hotel has everything inside it. You could stay here for a week without needing to get out of the hotel and enjoy it. The gardens are beautiful, the food excellent and the pool, the greatest pool in the world. ",5,
"I returned to my room to discover i had left my phone on the table of the roof top restaurant.  Thinking it was gone for good I returned to the restaurant to check and was delighted to find Mr Jeet and Mr Gavin from security had recovered it.  Upon returning the following evening i took time to observe the regiment they provide. They are not just standing or walking around. They are in a very high observation mode. Checking,  looking, relentlessly to assure the comfort and safety of the Customer.    I was lucky because they were on duty.   Thank you. ",5,
"I book a one night stay with my husband and son because I wanted to experience it. What was good: the property is very impressive, the rooms, the decor, the pool on the rooftop is amazing and the views fantastic. WE booked to stay one and a half days, so paid for a second half day departing at 6PM. The room was never serviced which considering the heat in Singapore and the fact th we used the pool was really inconvenient. We mentioned this on checkout and they were nonchalant. We had a room with a view of the city and the room was well equipped. The view is worth the upgrade. Lighting was a bit complex and we could not work it out. We had breakfast in our room and it was good (not excellent by any means) and they did not forget anything.  The pool on the roof-deck is not really…",4,
"Very impressive hotel, room was extremely comfortable and great house keeping.  Lovely views from our room.  We had breakfast  included every morning which was great, wide variety of food.  Roof top pool lived up to expectations and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Hotel in fabulous location, so close to restaurants and nightly light shows, casino and shopping. Only disappointment was sunrise yoga, not value for money unless you want to pay to see sun rise from top of hotel.  Maybe ok if you are not experienced in yoga, but as I’m a yoga instructor myself, found the actual yoga experience not at all enjoyable or satisfactory.   Overall would recommend this hotel for a memorable stopover.",4,
"We came here for a birthday celebration and enjoyed our time here. It was pretty busy at check in but upon arrival we had someone assisting us with where to go. Check in line was long but with all operators and counters in use, it did not take long for us to be checked in. Our room was ready early so we were able to head up straight away. Our room was on level 44, overlooking Gardens of the Bay and harbour. Very clean with lovely views. The infinity pool on level 57 was the highlight of our stay. Highly recommend a swim at sunrise, during the day and at night for the fabulous photo opportunities. Was the perfect way to cool down. Breakfast was a little pricey, but to be expected at a place like MBS. Wide variety of food and drinks available for breakfast, wasn't disappointed.…",5,
"After staying for 5 nights in Hotel Ramada, our last night was booked for Marina Bay Sands. We were 2 families, so had booked 2 normal rooms. At the time of check-in, they didn't tell us the room number. The person who guided us to our rooms, told us that you have been upgraded to ""Straits Suite"". When we opened the suite, we were in for an awesome awesome surprise....it was like a whole big suite, with two bedrooms, one guest room, personalized gym, massage station, karaoke room, big living room with a big piano, kitchen. On top of it, it was on 50th floor, when hotel has 57 floors. Till  the time we checked out, we were in awe of the suite and the favor they had done to us. We were looking for the cost of the suite etc., showed it to all our family members on phone that this…",5,
All you can say is OMG. This hotel is 3 Towers all in connecting with the most amazing sky roof pool and lower level shopping centre. It even has a roller skating rink and gondola boats in it. SO many upper class shops and restaurants as well as restaurants on the roof.A good family hotel.A very busy hotel.,5,
"Room was spacious. Room service is nice. The only thing I don’t like is you can’t just go in and eat breakfast, you have to queue and wait.Maybe it’s the Singaporeans’ thing. Infinity pool is not overrated, It’s is really awesome.",4,
What a lovely stay we had at The Marina Bay Sands!! From check in to check out everything was simply smooth and flawless! It was my husband's 40th birthday and we made the best decision of celebrating it at this iconic hotel. We had booked a basic category room with city view and I was little sceptical about the view that we would get but when I entered the room I was just awestruck!! It was truly amazing! I could sit for hours and hours together near that large wall to wall window gazing at the beautiful skyline and the famous bay area!! Beautiful view! Our room was located on the 39th floor. I guess whenever I'm coming next I would request them to give me the same room :-) The rooms are pretty huge in size with decent interiors. A good size bathroom. The basic category rooms…,5,
"My boyfriend and I had this as our final destination for a 14 day Asia trip. We stayed two nights at the Pan Pacific nearby and had decided to treat ourselves for a final night (and late checkout) at the Marina Bay Sands. We had booked well in advance via the hotel website and got ~10 % or so. We also booked late checkout by email and got it settled quickly and without issues. Be aware you are not allowed to use the pool after checkout, so since we had a late flight (around midnight) we wanted to make use of the hotel as long as possible. Late checkout was 6 pm and we had to pay 50 % of a night.  When leaving the Pan Pacific we wondered if we were foolish to do so as we were really happy there, but as soon as we got to MBS we new we had made the right decision. If I had to…",5,
"We decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands really for the infinity pool on the roof and the view from there.  Check in was simple and we got a small free upgraded room.  The room was on 26th level and large and view to gardens and bay.  The pool was great, not too crowded if you think there are over 2,000 rooms there.    Day and night views were a different feeling and also can try the free spa opposite the pool if feel a bit cool from the dip.  Hundreds of shops and a couple food court within walking distance but advise take a Grab or taxi to Merlion as about 2km walk in high humidity.",5,
Was there with family for 3 days and it wasn’t enough for completely exploring the hotel. One of the finest hotel with different cuisine. Visit casino in lobby if you have time.garden by the bay is spectacular we stayed in family room it was spacious and with breathtaking view..Do try eatery called gastronomia in marina bay sands it’s really good,5,
"The room was Huge.. with a main bedroom, a entertainment room, and Beautiful View of the city. The bedroom have a nice separated bath tub and shower area, and a large bed with a small sofa. Room was really comfortable, and the view was magnificent.   We have complimentary breakfast at club 55 , which was nice English buffet breakfast. The access for Infinity pool was complimentary as well, from there the whole Singapore view is available and its a must go if you are coming to Singapore.",5,
"Well.. even I’m working in Singapore abt 7years. To be honest, this is my first time visit Marina Bay. I mean go inside the building. The decoration is actually simple, but the architecture is simple and nice (Less is more). Will try to visit the Swimming pool next time!",5,
"The only reason we stopped here was to use the infinity pool and get the photo there.. It is expensive, and there are probably better value hotels in Singapore. Very nice and easy check in, and as it was our first visit here, they put us on a high floor... Great view over the gardens. Room, large, comfortable, nice bed, quality bathroom toiletries, robe and decent slippers, everything you would expect. However, it is very expensive to eat and drink here, so we did not bother apart from snacks and nibbles at the pool. Great location for all the sights, and city sight seeing bus stop.",5,
"It was thrilling to spend a night in such an iconic hotel. Due to its exceptional architecture and location, the arrival was stunning. Unfortunately, the hotel is victim of its success: Too many noisy crowds of tourists and guests everywhere, big groups and delegations shouting and taking pictures don’t make you feel you are a VIP. Our room was comfortable but squarish and the design very average, which contrasts with the exceptional architecture. Our view on the sea was nice but we couldn’t stay on the terrace due to the noise of the highway passing just below. I presume bedrooms with a view on the city are better on that point. Breakfast was great, and of course, the infinity pool was the highlight of our experience.",4,
"I stayed 6 nights in Marina Bay Sands Hotel in May 2018, in Premier Garden View room number 3990, facing the Gardens by the Bay. View was absolutely perfect, with private balcony and very efficient lifts within the Tower 1, where my room was located. The main and top class point of this Hotel is of course, the world famous roof top swimming pool, on the 57th floor. This pool gives an amazing view on Singapore (but not giving the view on Gardens by the Bay), water is not cold at all and once inside this pool, you will notice 2 amazing things ! There will be ALWAYS people all around... This pool is almost under attack from early in the morning until late in the evening, so do not expect quite, peaceful, relaxing times there ! Second amazing point is the number of people making…",4,
"I attended Oracle Code event during May 2018 at MBC aka Marina Bay Sands. It can accommodate 500+ attendees across multiple halls.   Great WiFi connectivity as well to the extent that my session was up on YouTube, the moment I conclude it!   Overall, good experience and there's adjacent mall, restaurants, river, etc.   It's arguably the only 7 star hotel in Asia.   It's a privilege to be at MBC, infinity pool is one of the popular activity for hotel guest.",5,
Very good hotel on all aspects infinity pool on the 57th floor awesome we had very good American breakfast staff was very friendly. Very clean room and friendly staff. Exceeded all our expectations during our stay ,5,
"This is an extremely busy hotel. Thousands of guests service is good but slow. The best thing about this hotel is the infinity pool on the roof which is fantastic, but again at time very crowded. Good location in Singapore.",4,
"Staff was very accommodating.  Property is very, very big and caters to conventions and tour groups.  However, it was very convenient (connected through a skybridge) to the Exhibition Hall where I had business.  Club Level Lounge was extremely crowded on most days with tourists and baby strollers.  They have a nice feature where you can go to the two main lobby restaurants for breakfast rather than sit in an overcrowded lounge.  Housekeeping was excellent - well done!  Overall, a great hotel if you like big.",4,
"An awful welcome at the front door set the scene. Better at reception and then plummeted at the roof pool. Alas, it reflected the quality of the finishes of the hotel which was poor and more suited to a sleepy bar in Vegas.  I guess big hotels just aren’t our thing. £500 for one night was just about ok, and only because of the photos from the infinity pool, which was the highlight. Rooms are a good size, again badly finished I",3,
"Fabulous check-in experience by Kiwi who was our receptionist. He managed to give us a room upgrade (requested a city view room but the upgrade was premium) and late check out, which were both greatly received.   We only stayed one night in the hotel, and the main reason for this is that it is an iconic hotel and with the infinity pool overlooking Singapore. This did not disappoint but was treated more as a tourist activity. The pool was fabulous and the location was perfect- make sure to go and see the light/water show in the plaza (rivals the Bellagio and Dubai Fountains, with the addition of the lights) and the roof top trees light up in Gardens by the Bay.   The room was lovely - great view of the water and city through floor to ceiling windows. Staff were friendly, polite…",5,
I don't knoiw how many Hotels and Resorts in the world. I have travelled 30 countries in the world....but I think Hotel Marina Bay Sands in the mother of all beauty where real relaxation spoke for me.,5,
Ok..from all the reviews previously mentioned the hotel is a very large and beautiful hotel yes the Infinity pool is magnificent so is the atrium.The rooms are large and comfortable and so is the bathroom.Views are to die for.I paid a premium price for a one night stay.Around $560USD a night.So..heres what happened. We were at the infinity pool.Next to us was a very nice caucasian couple.Along comes a waiter...he asks them if they would like any drinks/food?They declined.And off went the waiter.Without even asking us whether we wanted anything.Now from my observation after that...the waiter seemed to only target caucasian guests. We then went to the cafe next to Spagos and approached the 3 ladies at the entrance.They were busily chichatting with each other even though it was…,3,

I'm greatly appreciated his excellent service to guest. Going for extra mile for within his job scope. Keep up the good work with thank :)",5,
"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands had always been on my bucket list and my experience at the hotel did not disappoint. We arrived around 4pm on a Friday and after a short wait at check-in were allocated a Premier Twin room on a low floor overlooking the the shopping center and city. The room was large and had adequate space for two people. I do wish we had splurged for a higher floor view, but since we were only going to be at the hotel for one-night, I did not find the additional cost necessary. The bathroom was a decent size, though I found it peculiar that the bathtub was located inside the shower. Bathrobes and slippers were provided as were all the necessary toiletries.  After getting settled in our room, our first stop was the legendary pool. It was quite packed at 5pm and…",5,
"The hotel itself is a tourist attraction in Singapore. The day that we arrive there was a lot of people in the lobby, a bit stressful but OK.  The Rooms really good, and the cleaning service as well.  About the facilities, theres is a lot of good shops in the same building, and also the impressive casino, you have to visit although you don't play.  And the famous Infinity pool is really good and funny to be there, BUT there is one thing that they have to take care. I saw other guests ordering food and eating just NEXT to the water, and we saw that accidentaly a guest throw a lot of french fries into the water... it was really disgusting. So please, don't serve food in that area, it's a shame.",5,
"Friendly and superprofessional staff, modern and futuristic facility, excellent location (including nearby Garden by the Bay, Merlion, MRT station as a good starting point for excursions), great restaurants, amazing Infinity Pool. The Hotel is definitely worth the price paid. I strongly recommend, I will gladly come back here.",5,
"Sold the promise of luxury, but received a ordinary room in a large hotel with little or no thrills in the room. The communal areas are staggeringly extraordinary with shopping galore. It has a casino (no draw for me) a sky deck with the misnomer of “sky park” and an infinity pool hotel guests only  ( a definite draw for me) but I’ve come away feeling I’ve just had a £400 swim. Surely there should be more for the hotel guests? Perhaps discounted entrance to the conservatories in the park would be a start? It’s well positioned for the wonderful gardens of the bay and our room on the 48th floor had a fantastic vista of the Singapore harbour roads and the electric trees. The televised bill break down was confusing and the delivery of another guests luggage worrying. Although we got…",3,
"Whilst visiting Singapore we afforded ourselves a one night treat in a City View Orchid Suite with breakfast. It cost a hefty S$874, about (750 +GBP).  But we do have to say it was excellent, views were fabulous, furnishings and accomodation fantastic. Room Service was excellent served by smiling, happy staff in the dining area, the food itself was excellent, hot and well presented. The bath faced the sea, the shower size could have hosted a party, electric curtains, blinds and do not disturb signs made for an effortless stay. Toiletries and towels were abundant. Hard to find a complaint with the Suite and Room Service.

"I had booked premier gardens side room. They provided me the room on 47th floor, which had superb views of gardens by the bay. The Infinity Pool is just amazing. Also on arrival I was congratulated by the staff as I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and as a good gesture they provided me 250gms cake. Just Had a Awesome Stay Highly Recommended💕",5,
"Step inside a new level of excellence, from the beautiful spacious lobby with organised, quick, personal check-in to Skypark on Lv 57, this is a beautiful, amazing hotel. My husband and I enjoyed three nights here in March 2018.  We were on Level 11 with view over Gardens by the Bay.  Stunning.  You don't need to be up high for a fantastic view from your room (which costs extra).  We spent a lot of time in the pool and could enjoy the view up there of the Gardens, city and port. Speaking of which, the pool was just amazing!  We met other travellers that had stayed at another Hotel and then come to Bay Sands for one night, just so they could enjoy the pool!.  We dined at two of the hotels restaurants, see other reviews and both were fantastic. As was the lobby bar, the cocktails…",5,
"Having an excuse of attending a conference gave me the option to choose between a thousand other hotels and this one. It was no contest.   This iconic landmark is designed to take you closer to a God as you indulge in its excellence and though it is on the expensive side, are YOU  not worth it ?  So book in for a week and ponder the blessings Life has showered on you.   The rooms facing the gardens are the better side and the Infinity Pool is the cherry on the top.",5,
"Singapore is home to some amazing architecture.  Mainly modern and forward thinking.  This hotel is no different.  You can see it from almost anywhere.  The infinity pool on the top is spectacular although the water is a little chilly! 5 stars.  Best quality room service I've ever had and it arrives hot and very gourmet choices.  The rooms are well laid out with lots of space for clothing and a modern and spotless bathroom.  I had a room with 2 queen beds.  My view on the 17th floor looked out over the ocean and Gardens by the Bay.  There were hundreds of ships waiting to be loaded or unloaded.  I found this fascinating.  Not everyone would.  Given it's at least 30 C and humid everyday, a lot of shopping and eating can be found in underground malls.  Marina Bay is connected to…",5,
"It was a scary and traumatizing experience for us, as a newly wed couple, and of all places, the venue where we got married less than 12hours ago.  We had to worry for our safety and privacy staying in the bridal suite room on 26th May 2018 to 27th May 2018, as there was a person intruding into our suite room using the master access card. The person did not press the door bell, knock on the door, or even identify himself, and simply entered our room without notification. We were shocked, and shouted at the person, and the explanation given by the person was ""Checking on mini bar"". The real intention of the intruder is still unknown, we are not ruling out the possibilities of theft as well. Response to the complaint by the managers could not explain clearly why the person entered…",1,
We had a brief stay at Marina Bay Sands to celebrate our honeymoon and were completely taken care of. The hospitality was above and beyond our expectations. We stayed in the bridal suite which had breathtaking views of Singapore. The room was made up beautifully and designed to be so memorable for us.  A big thanks to Wangelin Sum who was a fabulous host to my husband and I.  -Samantha Goodrich,5,
"We stayed there with my 2 kids. After staying at another hotel in the city, we where all unimpressed. From standing in the lobby and waiting to check in for over an hour and check out 30 minutes,  to lifts being so busy. It’s a nice hotel but without a soul and personal touch. Rooms are nice and big but would not go back. Even our kids were not impressed and wanted to check out earlier, that should tell you a lot.  The tower entrance staff are not helpful at all for the check out people, I was with my family including kids and had several pieces of luggage. All I handled myself along with the trolleys. when I asked for help, the one thing they said was you can do by yourself we are busy and was staring at me. I am shocked with the attitude.",4,
"We arrived early and were able to check in immediately but handy to know that if your room isnt yet ready they will provide you with a pool and sundeck access pass so you will be able to use the facilities. On entrance to the room we were rewarded with a fantastic view - I wont ruin the surprise for you! Infinity pool was amazing and never appeared to be too crowded, poolside food was good and overall cleanliness and tidiness was brilliant. Cant wait to stay here again! IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.",5,
I stayed one night in a beautifully appointed suite and must thank the Premium Services team for making our stay extra special and memorable. Thank you in particular to Jasvan and Joanne for accomodating my requests and providing the extra touches to make the proposal special. I greatly appreciated the early check-in/late check-out and complimentary amenities as well as the upgrade. Keep up the good work!,5,
"This hotel is in incredible. The architecture is awesome! The room are generous in size, the view is amazing. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. We really appreciated the staff who is attentive and dedicated to their clients. I would particularly thanks Mr Denis (swimming pool), I really appreciated his kindness and the time he spend with us! Denis! Thanks again for the pictures!  I can only recommend this hotel.",5,
"Perfect spot for a swim  all be it at a hefty room rate per night. Having said that the motel is well located, the rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Check in/out is smooth so treat yourself for a couple of days, enjoy the view and cross this on of the bucket list",4,
"Probably one of the fanciest place i have ever been, this hotel quite amazing, pool at the top, everybody comes to have a drink, neverthelss the rooms are not as a ""waoo"" as the veiw from the top of the hotel (or maybe I was not so lucky)",4,
While the hotel easily seen from anywhere in Singapore the visit to its observation deck on 56th Floor was unique though in hot sun  While one traverses on the terrace observing the entire city and its small island one always feels dwarfed by the sea that surrounds this island ,5,
"Being a very large hotel, its running costs must be enormous.  This is probably why its so expensive.  It has friendly and competent staff and provides a good quality, clean room though lacking in any character.  It's infinity pool has a view, but the water is too warm and pool is very shallow.  Swim in the morning as it gets a little cloudy later on.  I'm afraid its too expensive and clinical for me.",3,
"Chill out at the afternoon in the fantastic long pool with a spectacular city view of Singapore is such a fabulous experience in enjoying life.   Single, Couples, Families, All are enjoying this great moment .  Release Stress ,  Relaxing Time Recharge Spirit   🍷  🍹 🍻   ",5,
"We stayed there with a teenager son, who requested this hotel. After staying at another hotel in the city, we where all unimpressed. From standing in the lobby and waiting to check in for over an hour, to lifts being so busy. It’s a nice hotel but without a soul and personal touch. Rooms are nice and big but would not go back. Even our teenager was not impressed and wanted to check out earlier, that should tell you a lot ",3,
"Us and friends booked 2 Club rooms for one special night at the end of our Singapore stay. We arrived about 1pm hoping to get in early and make the most of the facilities. We were told to line up at Toer one reception even though we had club rooms, not a major but expected an express line, not the grand central station rush hour at check in counters. Staff members walked around and offered juice to people in the lines. On check in......we were in luck. The receptionist explained that we had been upgraded to a suite but would have to share, a little disappointed, she asked if we would like to see the room, I asked how much the room goes for if it was an upgrade, and she explained that it was a suite and it went for $8000 a night......of course we took it. A staff member lead us…",4,
"Great stay and amazing hospitality. I would personally recommend taking the club room if you r travelling as a family with kids . The club lounge serves between 7 am to 7 pm .. breakfast , snacks and happy hours . The pool is a must see . Sands mall below has a metro so easy to access other places in the city and also u hv good shopping options too . Do not miss garden by the bay .if u r an Indian vegetarian. Indian veg breakfast is available at rise - lobby level . They r strict about the check in and check out timings .",5,
"I was captivated by the Marina Bay Sands! This magnificent structure can be seen from many places and each time I see it from another angle I’m in awe. Very conveniently located and guests can watch the Marina light show, or the Garden by the Bay light show.",5,
"Once I booked my flight to Singapore, I immediately looked into a room at MBS because what's a trip to Singapore without visiting the infamous infinity pool?  Upon arrival, the staff was friendly and professional and the room was spacious.  (Sidenote, it had probably one of the comfiest pillows I have ever slept on, EVER.)  My only gripe was, and I had figured going into it, being a large hotel, everything was quite the walk to get to.  However, there was a lot to do and see and I must say, the water show was top notched!  Now, onto the pool.  Given the popularity, the hotel has put in place strict measures to access the pool.  You have to be a hotel guest and have to swipe your room key in order to enter and leave.  I made it a point to go fairly early before the crowds and it…",4,
"This stay was a little gift to ourselves and it was just perfect. The Marina Bay is a five star hotel with five star service, amenities and pool. If you have plenty of money to spend its paradise. The shopping mall below the hotel is packed full of designer shops and a great food court. Nothing is too much here as i wouldn't expect anything less.",5,
"Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband. We stayed in a standard room in tower 3 with Gardens at the bay views. Wow! what a view from the room especially of an evening when the Gardens were lit up. Room was spacious, very good bathroom and the curtains opened as you entered the room which really added to the wow factor of the view. Rooms cleaned regularly and to a very good standard. Roof top pool is essentially why you stay here and it does not disappoint. Never feels over crowded even though there are many people there. I’d recommend going at least one evening when the city is lit up of a night. Only thing that lets the hotel down is the lengthy check in process (at least 30 minute wait) which after a 17 hour flight from the U.K. is a disappointing introduction to the hotel.…",5,
"I visited this hotel recently with my family. It’s an expensive stay but worth the money. Took the premium room on 47th floor with garden view. The view was amazing. The room was fantastic, huge with a balcony. One must stay a day atleast to get most out of travel experience in Singapore. However, few moments killed our stay experience. The combination of hordes of guests and poor customer service. The customer service is perhaps this hotel's biggest Achilles heel. It starts from the minute your cab pulls up at the entrance; no porters so you have to manage your luggage inside yourself. Thereafter, expect a long queue for check in. When you finally get settled in room, you may wish to check out the famous pool. Just be aware that to be admitted into the pool area you must take…",2,
"Wow from the moment we arrived ... they showed us to our room immediately and checked us in there , thank you Cindy Go !! She was so helpful and I feel so comfortable. For a large, amazing hotel it was so friendly ......  So the infinity pool on the roof wow ! It was on my bucket list and did not disappoint. So many photo opportunities, the views are breathtaking......  we also ate at the Ce La Vi restaurant , with drinks beforehand and had a a singapore sling , amazing ! we had a great table , the service was fantastic - including talking to Alihah. Thank you .",5,
"This iconic hotel, with the most amazing infinity pool, has to be one of those man made structures that is being added to more and more people’s “bucket lists”.  The three majestic towers raising high above the Singapore skyline, top off by an amazing platform in the shape of a space ship, bullet train or surf board - you decided.  It’s not cheap, but it is a must if only to be able to experience the infinity pool that stretches across the three towers and gives a spectacular view of the city.   (NB: only residents can use the pool - non residents can only go to a viewing platform)  Once inside the building is bright and open, not as spectacular as the outside but due to a very high space you get a sense of large building.  We arrived at Tower 1 and was faced with a huge queue…",5,
"i have been in this hotel for 4 days. i booked a double room which had more than enough space. i think most of the people come here due to the infinity pool, and indeed it's one of the reason why i booked it too. The swimming pool is amazing and huge, in addition to an amazing view of the city. Furthermore, the hotel has direct connections to the metro and shop/restaurants.",5,
Beautiful hotel both inside and outside. There is a swimming pool on the roof. A panoramic view of the roof gates its awesome. A beautiful fountain show takes place near the hotel at night. There are many lifts in the building.,5,
WOW..what an absolute treat. Arrived late at night and we were given a free upgrade to a corner suite in Tower 1..The views from all the windows were stunning. Breakfast was delicious as was the seafood buffet lunch. Dinner was an International buffet delicious. We highly recommend this hotel...,5,
My husband and i stayed at this fabulous hotel for the last two nights of our Honeymoon. In fact it was this hotel and The Gardens By The Bay that decided our holiday having never visited this part of the world before. I saw a picture and was hooked and it did not disappoint.  I had seen on a YouTube vlog that check-in could take as long as half an hour! We arrived at Tower 1 and the queues were huge but thankfully one of the hotel staff read our paperwork and redirected us to Tower 3 where there was no queue. So my top tip would be go straight to Tower 3 (nearest tower to The Singapore Flyer) it is much quieter and a much more pleasant check-in experience.  Our deluxe room was amazing and overlooked The Gardens By The Bay. It was a huge luxurious room with great toiletries and…,5,
"Excellent luxury hotel, lots of activity  World class pool , lots of shows although paid , night club, big rooms n toilets shopping arcade, MRT station with direct link from hotel Garden of bay view room just superb",5,
"After pondering for days we opted for a city view room but people have divided opinion on which is the best. The room on the 40th floor was similar to a hotel room you'd find for a lesser price but the view of the skyline at night was just amazing and one of the best I've ever seen. The hotel is so conveniently placed so you can do a lot of window shopping at the branded shops and have a vantage point for the magnificent laser light show at night. The enormous infinity pool must not be missed although it's relatively crowded all the time. Finally, we had to mail the hotel reminding them about the security deposit of SG200 which was released almost three weeks after the visit but I did not know whether it had  something to do with us opting for the quick checkout rather than…",4,
"After a 4 week cruise from Sydney we wanted somewhere special to finish off a magical birthday holiday for my wife and I.  The iconic Marina Bay Sands stood out, literally, and we decided to bite the bullet and stay here for our 1 night in Singapore.  Not cheap, we booked a Club Room which gave us access to Club55 with breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks etc included as well as to the gym and SkyPark infinity pool etc.  We disembarked our ship at 06.45, grabbed a 'posh' taxi from the cruise terminal to go the 3km to our hotel so arrived at about 07.00! Room was not ready (we were a bit optimistic) but staff were very accommodating and let us drop our cases off so we could go for a stroll around the Gardens By The Bay.  We got back to the hotel around 09.00, room still not done but…",5,
"Stayed for 3 nights, loved the infinity pool it was amazing. Very convenient for all the sights and seeing singapore. Room was a bit disappointing on arrival as was set up for two people with only two single beds even though we had booked for 3 people. But this was soon resolved with a camp bed being delivered. And cake and champagne for a birthday celebration. Over great place to stay and would love to come back but would stay in a bigger room next time. ",4,
"You must have a full day to cover this area. MBS, shopping area, Merlion park are the most recommended places in this area. There is a special boat service too where you can enjoy a 40mins ride. If you are on a long transit about 8-10 hrs still I recommend to visit this area.  Changi airport is having a free tour service for transit passengers.",5,
"I visited this hotel recently. It is a bit expensive but really worth the view. We took the premium rooms on 47th floor with garden view from where we could see the Gardens of the bay and marina with all the ships near the coast. The view was amazing. The hotel also provides access to infinity pool on 57th floor which gives the whole city view. The room was fantastic, huge with huge balcony. The bathroom was really awesome, huge and the premium rooms seem very romantic for couples. One must atleast stay one day in this hotel to get most of your travel experience in Singapore. ",5,
Marina bay certainly has the best views in the city with spectra light show in the night. Infinity pool also is amazing. However the views from the hotel top and the architecture of the building is only what you pay for. Rest everything is as usual as any other good hotel. You can also see the gardens by the bat night view from the back side of the sky bar.,4,
"i wud def.recommend couples with toddlers to visit this place. there is plenty of open space for toddlers to run about, and there was live music playing in the open area when we went. very bright n lively atmosphere, also a good number of branded clothing stores, a casino, n number of restaurants occupy MBS, on the ground floor.",5,
"from the airport, I checked in early in the morning, so I enjoyed swimming in the pool at the top of the hotel for my first staying and refreshed after long trip. Very famous and Marvelous view from the pool. People can look at Merlion from the pool. The room is nice with a huge balcony and view to the bay. The service is very good and all staffs are kind and have good hospitality. On one side of the hotel there are nice botanical gardens and on the other a nice view of the city. An onderground elegant mall is just a step from the hotel. In the hotel there are many delicious and popular restaurants. Ritz Carlton hotel is just 5 min walking from the hotel. It is absolutely one of the best hotels in the world.  I recommend you to select Marina Bay Sands hotel for your next luxury…",5,
"Still the better hotels around with big club rooms but the crowd at the pool is terrible. Especially you wish to chill and relax at the pool, the crowd is noisy and its a mess up there with mainland China tourists. Not sure how they get up or if they are guest or not. Stayed the club room, still the best one around. Big and spacious. Very comfortable. Checking in is a big problem, parking too when there is too much crowd.",4,
"Styed here for 3 days and 2 nights and had a very amazing time. The hotel is located in the most convenient of places (very near to the Merlion park, Gardens by the Bay, and right above a mall and the MRT station). Didn’t really expect much because it’s very modernized but the staff is very accommodating. Just make sure to research the paid amenities before you spend your hard earned money coz some of them were made for persons who live an extravagant lifestyle so spend wisely 😊",5,
"As I said, it is big and expensive.  I felt that the restaurants and the hotel itself somewhat over priced. I don't want to take away any keen effort  and services that the management was providing. i liked the size and the variety of shops, restaurants and etc.  you got everything in there , but, boy,  they do not come at cheap price.",4,
"This Hotel is enormous & way too impersonal for me! Had been so looking forward to staying in this striking iconic Hotel but was disappointed. Check-in was awful as had to wait at least 30 minutes standing in what felt like a budget airline queue. Our deluxe room was OK but lacked any way factor, apart from the view. The stunning pool was very busy indeed, too busy. Some of the building lacks the quality of workmanship you would expect when you look closely.",3,
"A really awful experience from check-in to check-out. There is so much poor service and bad experience to detail in the 18 hours we were at the hotel that it won’t fit in the text space. The saddest part was that it was to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday. Check-in is very under staffed (40 mins wait) and like queuing for a school lunch, the 55th floor Club lounge is a joke (since when do you have to queue to get in to a hotel lounge???), seated FINALLY at a cocktail table full of someone else’s dirty crockery/leftovers (see photos) and under staffed: really really dreadful and unprofessional service at every single step of the way. It was so bad in the Club 55 lounge that other guests were videoing the experience on their iPhones and cameras. The building itself is impressive…",1,
"This hotel is amazing...Me and my family stayed here for about a week and from the moment we arrived everything was just amazing. When we arrived, the check-in line was kinda long so one of the lobby staff members pulled us aside to the VIP room check-in where there was no wait. (Still puzzles me on why we were picked out from everyone else standing in line)...lol Anyway, we were on the 39th floor with spectacular views, just breath taking. Our room selection (Club Room King with City View) included breakfask every morning and I believe lunch but we only made it to breakfast. Buffet style with a made to order section as well. Everything we ate was good. If you go around 7am you can catch the sunrise. A must see..The infinity pool there is something to see and experience. To be…",5,
"I was fortunate to stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for both business trip combined with a family trip. The complex itself with its 3 towers, endless shopping opportunities, amazing celebrity chef dining choices is overwhelming, to say the least. The staff and service are 5 star AND it is, without doubt, the most beautiful Infinity Pool in Singapore. However, the overwhelming size of the complex made it feel more like an airport than a hotel. There were so many people, guests, and tourists, at all times. A real hustle-and-bustle going on at all times of the day. Some may like this, but I prefer hotels that offer some tranquillity and private space. It also has so much to do and see that one could be tempted to never leave...and that would be the greatest shame as Singapore has…",4,
"We stayed here for a night after coming back from a recent holiday in Thailand. The room we had booked had express check in and Club room benefits including free breakfast, free afternoon tea from 2pm to 4pm, free drinks and canapes from 5pm to 7pm and is situated on the 55th floor.The food and views were fantastic.  I had unfortunately fallen ill half way through our trip and after arriving back in Singapore and speaking to the staff at MBS, (who showed genuine concern for my well being) had arranged a late checkout (at extra cost) for us which was most beneficial, until we headed back to the airport later that evening.  Walking around the Marina Bay shoppes is also good way to pass some time and  have a reprieve from the warm and humid conditions outside.",5,
Everything about our stay at marina bay sands was amazing . The rooms are stunning and the view from the pool left us speechless. We had a room with balcony over looking  the gardens by the bay which was beautiful.  Food and drinks are on the expensive side but we were prepare for that. An experience that will never be forgotten ,5,
"I stayed at the marina bay sands on the 14th of may for my 24th birthday for one night and what can I say it’s a birthday I will not forget!! We checked in much earlier than we should have around 11am and the hotel where so accommodating to this as we only had one night we wanted to make the most of our stay. The hotel were kind enough to advise they had upgraded my room for my birthday to a city view room on the 23rd floor. I don’t know what I was expecting but what I can say is I was completely blown away. The room will never be topped by another hotel the breath taking views out onto the marina the walk in shower big enough for 4 beautiful bath, bed and living area and a walk in wadrobe! The hotel even had birthday cake delivered to my room!!! We used the pool throughout the…",5,
"It was a good experience but as expected very crowded. I would not recommend the swimming pool for anyone because it is too crowded. However, the hotel is amazing and the view from the top is as beautiful as it gets.",5,
"This review comes with a heavy heart because I was just expecting so much more, don't get me wrong it's a fantastic hotel but it could do more to improve it's customer interaction and be so much more. We have just recently returned from our honeymoon trip to Far East, incorporating 3 nights at Concorde Hotel, Singapore then 10 nights in Bali with our last indulgent night being at MBS. We had a late flight from Bali into Singapore and got to the hotel around 8.30pm last Friday night. Check in was via Tower 1 and you immediately realise after all the great service we had received that this place was going to be an impersonal and robotic experience. Straight into the long queue to check in with a usual bland greeting and a small tepid bottle of water, with half a smile, sign here…",2,
The rooms are expensive and average . The public areas are quite public . We didn’t find it overly personal . Perhaps if you want the mandatory pool photos stay a night . Otherwise stay in one of the city hotel with considerably better service .,3,
Marina bay sand... a dreamers dream to stay here.. it was just awesome n when u plu ge jnto the infinity pool you actually feel on top of the world.. the beauty of the light n sound show from the 45th floor of ur room is mesmerising extraordinary and totally mindblowing..the rooms are well maintained sooperbly decorated and totally worth every penny.. the marina mall is a shoppers paradise wid the best brands in town.. just awesome...,5,
Marina Bay Sand is one of the most beutiful Hotel that I experience ever. The Hotel itself is beutiful and even that it contain more than 2500 rooms the service is excellent. You can enjoy the pool at the 57th floor or one of the excellent resturants,5,
"Stayed with a friend for the f1 in 2017. Noting this place is massive, some 2000 rooms. Booking was easy via email to my now allocated booking agent. We arrived and were greeted by name, and taken straight to our suite for checkin. As always the room was clean, well maintained, and in fact had just been renovated. Fantastic view. Club unfortunately has been moved down a floor so no longer open air by the amazing pool deck. Food offering was a bit less variety too, but what was there was very tasty. Optimum location next to the f1,and a nice place to stroll from and get lost in the magic of some singaporean streets.",5,
"If you visit Singapore you must see Marina Bay Sands. If you appreciate luxury you must go to this point. An integrated resort notable for transforming Singapore’s city skyline, it comprises three 55-storey towers of extravagant hotel rooms and luxury suites equipped with personal butler service. In addition, its architecture is made complete with the Sands Sky Park which crowns the three towers.",5,
"we were exited ti stay at the hotel and had booked a suit with two rooms, when we got there there was a sate of confusion as a guest, had to work out which tower we were staying at then identify where to check in. once checked in you were sent on our way no offer of taking the suitcase to our room, when you are paying top dollar you expect top service, going to the top floor where the pools were was another state of stress, it was crowded getting up there then to find a spot by the pool was just jam packet, limited to your banana lounge with people all around and over you. I would not stay there again, been there done that.",2,
"The hotel is a destination it itself with shops, stage shows, signature restaurants, a world class rooftop infinity pool and convenient location.  What really sets it apart though is the level of customer service - ALL the staff, from  the concierge to the reception desk staff, housekeeping staff and service staff were attentive, responsive and friendly - without being over the top.  This is a credit to the management of the Hotel and the training they must put their staff through. It translates a quality stay into a really enjoyable experience.",5,
"Lovely hotel do not get me wrong, it definitely aires on the side of luxury however after reading previous comments surrounding the check in process and how busy it was it is true to say it is almost like the lines at an airport.   We arrived at 12 noon to stay for one night after already being in Singapore for 2 days. Check in is not until 3pm however our room was ready (much appreciated) so we headed up to our room which was great/clean and was a deluxe room on floor 14 upon check in advised that you will receive your bags in 15 minutes however we have to wait for our bags 30-40 minutes in the room before being able to head up to the top deck at floor 57! You have to get 2 lifts to the top floor as only goes to floor 34 and then a change. You can not access the gym from tower…",3,
"Incredible view, cost=facilities, there are restaurant and branded store here. Like inside of Singapore Airlines Business Class. Real five star hotels. Swimming pool above the cloud. Very nice for sunbathing",5,
If you want your legs to start going all wobbly get yourself to the 57th floor to the observation deck. The best views of around Singapore’s famous skyline. It’s about 24 sg dollars each and boy is it worth it for the views. There’s a shop on the top that sells drinks and snacks....or if you remember to wear pants and a shirt go to the cafe up the steps from the observation floor for a seat and a drink with or without food. ,4,
Stayed 2 nights in this amazing hotel it's a huge hotel combined of 3 buildings on top of them a swiming pool arestaurants. The rooms are nice with a view to the bay. The service is good. On one side of the hotel there are nice botanical gardens and on the other a nice view of the city. An onderground elegant mall is just a step from the hotel. In the hotel there are plenty restaurant . We really enjoyed this hotel.,5,
You can see all the part of singapore from top of the skypark. Its beautiful and well maintained place. Lots of tourist are coming at one time. Please avoid tha month may because it's too overcrowded. We cannot take much pics,5,
"This hotel is very nice and the pool is definitely something else.  We booked a club room with access to club 55. The room was perfect, on the 44th floor with amazing city views. Tea from 2pm to 4pm and champagne and canapes from 5pm to 7pm. We were treated very well until check out.  Our plane was in the evening so we thought we'll enjoy the pool on the last day but once you check out you are not allowed back up. They also are very unhelpful when collecting the bags from storage and will not help you carrying them/loading them in taxi. They basically welcome you very well and once you spent a fortune don't care about you. A bit of a shame for a ""luxury"" hotel, never had this issue anywhere else.",4,
Probably nothing to be said which won’t have been said before ...Absolutely Stunning!  Club Room was great value with the hotel allowing you in to Afternoon Tea at 2pm - even though checkin isn’t until 3pm.  Ditto with the pool - which can be accessed from 11am on day of arrival.  Only tip would be to go early for the complimentary Club drinks (which included Piper Heidseck champagne!). We went at 6pm (the drinks are on offer from 5-7pm) and it was so busy we had to wait 30mins before being seated.,5,
"We stayed in a club room on the 39th floor with a city view. The room was a great size and had fantastic views and good amenities. The pool was amazing , gets very busy  at times. The club 55 lounge was well worth it - the breakfasts  had a good variety , afternoon tea if you wanted it and the  evening  beverages and  canapes buffet was fantastic. The evening  canapes buffet was so good we didn't need dinner and there was a wide choice of alchohol   available. I would suggest a city view room  over the ocean as there is a  lot of development going on on that side at the moment and really you are looking at container  ships.  The staff were great and security  high. We could see the light show from our room if we wanted to.It was close to high end shopping and an MRT station.…",5,
"Let me be clear the pool at the top is incredible. It's even better than pictures would suggest. There are also amazing hot tubs which look out over the docks that are equally as good. However the rest of the hotel was a bit disappointing if I am honest. With all the hype I was expecting big things. There was nothing unique or special about check in, it was busy and a little chaotic. The room was nice but our toilet was blocked / very slow flushing and we had to do three lift changes to get to the pool. I tried the Sky Park morning yoga. Lovely location for a yoga class but it was a very odd experience. It felt like a fitness instructor had been shown some moves to do rather than someone who was trained in the holistic side of yoga. We rushed through the positions and it was all…",3,
"I had one night at the unique Marina Bay Sands - one of the most famous hotels in the world, certainly in Singapore. My flight arrived quite early in Singapore, but fortunately I was also able to check in early.   I had a Premier King Sky View room in Tower 1 on a high floor which did indeed have a very nice view of the Singapore skyline. From the room I could also watch Spectra - the impressive Light & Water Show.  Of course, one of the most notable features of the hotel is the rooftop infinity pool - apparently the biggest of its kind in the world. The hotel is only accessible to hotel guests, so of course I had to spend some time there during my stay. The pool was fairly crowded, with dozens of tourists taking selfies, but when the rain came over the afternoon it was easy to…",5,
"one of the most recognizable and iconic hotels in the world. we stayed two nights in early april and we loved it. we have never spent this much per night on accommodations but we figured this was something special that we could splurge on. after a 17 hour flight from north america we arrived at the hotel around 9am and we were so happy when the desk staff let us check in immediately. check in was fairly painless, maybe 10 minutes. our room was on one of the higher floors and had a very nice view of city and the bay. the room was nice and we had no complaints about it but there was nothing special about it other than the view. but we knew what we were really paying for was whats upstairs and thats where we went next. wow! everything on the roof is just so cool! the pool is…",5,
"I stayed as a couple on a children free getaway at Marina Bay Sands, the dining and bar options in this hotel and attached shoppes and casino are excellent expensive but quality.   The breakfasts at Spago on the rooftop and Adrift on ground floor are excellent. The pool views and area is something special and needs to be seen, busy but the views are spectacular.   The access to the Marina Bay Shoppes, Casino, gardens by the bay and the treetop gardens is excellent.   Make sure you get a higher floor room. The rooms are average I’ve stayed in better for less and Unfortunately due to the volume of people staying at the hotel the lifts are always busy and it definitely lacks the quality of service and special touch you get in smaller boutique hotels and resorts.   ",4,
"Due to an early morning flight from Rome, we had arrived 7 hours prior to check in.  We were offered an upgrade with immediate access for an extra 380 SGD per day. Alternatively we could use the pool with free wifi and wait. We took the latter and we only had to wait 3 hours for a room, which we had greatly appreciated.  The service level was exceptional from start to finish.  Our room was generous in proportion, the view amazing, complimentary toiletries, bottled water and wifi. Fantastic housekeeping, the room was immaculately clean and the amenities constantly replenished with a great supply of towels. Everything was as you would expect it to be with one exception... The hair dryer. What a big disappointment and in that humidity, you need a good hair dryer.  The hotel…",4,
"Customer service is not the specialty here as check in and check out processes were painfully long. Room was large with great view of the ocean and balcony. Pool is what they advertise, except with a turnstile system that makes you feel like you’re at an amusement park. Not value for money as it’s 5-star price with a 3-star ambiance. ",2,
"Marina bays sands is the type of place to experience luxury, I had four days at Marina bay first time stay, overall its a fantastic place to stay, the view is incredible and seeing the Poolside and different outlets around the sands is amazing, it is certainly a must see experience we had a city view room, the Hotel room was so lovely, we had room service and it got delivered quickly, Our first day was nice as soon as we jumped out of the taxi, greeted straight away, Check in was a probably 15 minute wait in line, then on our way up to room, then an hour later we went up to the bar, a bit on the pricey side, but that's Singapore, we went to the other bar that tourist go to on the pool level, and we ordered drinks they took one of our room cards, and waited to get it back, after…",5,
"From start to finish, this was an experience to savour and enjoy.  We had booked a transfer from our flight and they met us at the airbridge! Astounding! Shepherded us through Immigration and into a waiting car.  Then on arrival we were whisked staright up to our room for check-in!  I couldn't have enjoyed it more! I stay in heaps of hotels and I have to say this one tops everything - it's spectacular but it's also comfortable.  It's busy but the service is top notch.  If you're going to Singapore this is the place to stay - and you have to swim in that iconic pool!",5,
Fantastic view of the city when you go to the top. I spent 2 hours just lounging around taking in the sights and having a drink at the bar. It was an amazing experience. Recommended to anyway visiting Singapore to go up even for a short visit.,5,
"We completed our Southeast Asia trip with a night in the MBS. We booked a family room for 4 (2 adults, 2 kids). The room was impressive and really nice. 4 beds, nice bathroom, very modern, huge windows and great balcony.  Ok we didn’t have breakfast at the hotel - too expensive.  We did a late check out and due to a minor problem the hotel didn’t charge us for it. Very customer oriented! Thanks a lot! Finally I have to say the infinity pool on the roof top is unbelievable. It gives you such a special view on Singapur. Go and get it! You will enjoy any minute at the MBS. ",5,
"When I checked out, the receptionist was  extremely impolite. They put unknown others bill to me,  took more than 20 minutes to close even I said I was in hurry, but never use polite language towards me, no apology even I complained above.  The hotel dressed beautiful, but empty inside. I will never visit again.",1,
MJ makes the most wonderful drinks. The buffet quality and spread was superb.  Dessert and breads are of high standard.   We had an amazing birthday celebration with  the staff cheerfully serving and singing.,4,
"Marina Bay Sands three towers is something to experience but one time is enough. Huge hotel, lots of people and this lead to long queues (check in, breakfast etc.) Very clean and nice facilities (gym better than average). Nice, clean room, no traffic nouse problems. Iconic pool on the roof, nice views! I recommend going early in the morning, otherwise lots of people there.  Location good, easy to take the metro. Casino, shopping mall, expo centre in same buildings, can be reached indoors.  Gardens by the Bay can be reached in 5-10 minutes. Hotel guests have access also to the observation desk.  All in all, nice experience but still not quite worth of 5 stars or money spent.",4,
Marina Bay Sands was not on my must do list but now that I have stayed there I can see why it makes Instagram records. Let's start with check in...efficiency and friendliness is on high priority. You check in according to the tower you are booked in. The rooms are spacious. Really spacious. Nicely decorated and they have thought of all the little things. The pool....yes it really is extraordinary swimming in a pool that high up. Surprisingly it is fairly shallow so families will love it. It is busy and I have never seen so many people taking selfies. The service around the pool is wonderful and the staff are friendly...but a word to the wise be prepared for the prices. Disappointing for us is we signed up for the Marina Bay Sands Lifestyle card and did not get informed that as…,5,
"Stayed here again for my annual conference at the Expo Centre, and for the first time got a room facing Marina Bay and the financial district.  Beautiful views.  Room is, of course, spacious.  No complaints whatsoever.  Service was very, very good this time around.  We were entitled to the use of the upgraded internet speed, but had failed to register for it when logging in the first time.  I asked the Concierge in the lobby for help, and someone from IT had showed up at our door even before I arrived back at the room.  When he was unable to reset our connections remotely, he came back to our room, took down the IDs of all of our mobile devices, then returned to his office so he could finish helping us.  I only wish I wrote down his name so I could let management know how…",5,
"Absolutely brilliant.  I had always wanted to stay at the Marina Bay Sands and I've now been able to tick this off my bucket list!  On a recent trip to Singapore we spent two nights in a club room which I highly recommend.  This gave us access to afternoon tea and also evening drinks and canapes in their club lounge which has a terrific view and really added to the overall experience of staying in this incredible hotel.  My mother celebrated her birthday while we were there and the hotel sent up a complimentary birthday cake which was a lovely touch and greatly appreciated.  We arrived early before check in time, and were given access to the pool while we waited for our room, which was ready within the hour.  There is an MRT station right underneath the hotel which is very…",5,
"What an amazing experience! Probably one of the best if not THE best hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooftop pool alone deserves the 5 stars. I love how you could watch the sunrise and set in a pool overlooking the entire city. It was just amazing up there. We also ate in Rise for the breakfast buffet in the morning and it exceeded expectations. It is really easy to access Gardens by the Bay from there also. The staff were really helpful and lovely, the rooms were great. We even had a balcony overlooking gardens by the bay. I loved it! The gym was great - basically everything was great! Highly recommended and I def want to stay here again!",5,
"I have been attending a meeting there at night and unfortunately left my computer bag  in the trunk of the cab I used ...I did now at all how to proceed....I even did know what cab I used. Thanks to the Marina Bay Sands internal security department , they have been able to identify the license plate of the cab I used and then called the driver who kindly came back in the next 30 mn...Great and highly appreciated!",5,
"We stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon travels. The hotel is huge! almost too big to appreciate - much prettier to look at from the outside. The rooms are nice and spacious and very clean. The pool area can be very hectic, this was one of our highlights but you couldn't sit and relax for long , too many people. We went to LAVO on the top - this was very nice and if you can manage to get yourself a table by the window or outside the view is unreal at night. Perfect for relaxing whist having a drink.   All in all , I would not stay again , once you have done it its ticked. Its not a place you would keep going back to.",3,
"The marina Bay Sands is an excellent hotel. It’s expensive but it is awesome, the infinity pool, the lobby, the service. All was very fun. The pool and the jacuzzi are the most awesome in the world. The view is fantastic. ",5,
"Amazing view, nice rooms, great experience! it is expensive however worth it. There is alot of reviews about this place so won't say much. Great staff checked me in at 7am as my flight got there at 6am, so i basically had a whole day exploring the hotel. Try their oyster bar at the Shoppes area, if you like oysters that is. French Oysters and their white Cosmo - absolutely fabulous ! Rise for breaky was the best. Don't bother with Lovo, as their food isn't that great. Have their Pina Colada by the pool, comes in a pineapple. Great experience.",5,
"My husband and I stayed here at the end of April, we had a club room, certainly not cheap but definitely worth every penny.  Being club, we checked in in a separate lounge behind the main check in area where we were greeted and seated with a drink whilst waiting our turn to check in.  We weren't waiting long and even though we were checking in early at 12pm, a room was available for us.  This was on the 46th floor of Tower 2 and we had the most spectacular view.  We went up to our room and it certainly had the wow factor, it was HUGE!  Double doors led to the bathroom with had a bath and also a separate shower.  We had a large super comfortable bed and a desk area and also a large lounge area.  Floor to ceiling windows which provided us with a breathtaking view at night.…",5,
This is one of the best visits for me I arrived to the hotel and the team welcomed me they did a great job arranging a nice room and tour they took a good care of me and my family thank you for making it,5,
"Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands was an extraordinary experience with the location and the infinity pool being the highlights. The infinity pool is not to be missed and the whole family enjoyed the time there for several hours with relaxation and refreshments poolside. Then of course the refreshing pool and stunning views that seemed we couldn’t possibly take enough photos of.  Honestly, the room balcony was also great and the bedding was exceptionally relaxing. Elevator rides are of course part of the visit, but the effort can be expended knowing the view you enjoy from your room and the rooftop.  At a bit of a higher price point, one can question the value perhaps. I would argue if you are going to be away from the hotel during your whole visit and not enjoy the service and…",5,
"Who doesn’t know about this signature hotel of Singapore ? But this was our fist experience, it is expensive most hotel in Singapore but boy , every single penny is  worth it if you were to treat yourself and your family with something unique and master class.  The rooms are reasonably good sized, the bath area is corresponding to the luxury you have paid and you get the view of the bay and theirs beautiful garden. We got upgraded to use club 55, which is an added luxury of this hotel. The unlimited drinks, champagne, exotic seafood with no extra cost can spoil you to the core.  There are many restaurants and it is up to you how you want to be indulged.  The breakfast at Rise was a variety showcase. Mostly you have to wait for ten to twenty minutes during the morning but the…",5,
This was one of my dream destinations and I am happy the dream was wonderfully treated.   The most exclusive of the hotels you will see around in the world. We enter via tower 1 and we moved all the way to the tower 3 for our reservations.   We had 3 rooms booked - we got one in the 9th floor and the other 2 in the 39th floor. The spacious luxury rooms are located from level 1 to level 10 and the deluxe rooms with sea/ garden/ city views are located in the 11th to 53rd floor.  Though mine was a no view room but I could see the garden by bay very very clearly and nicely from my balcony. Choose the Garden view rooms in case you want to enjoy the beauty and fresh air.  The bell boy service is super prompt and highly efficient - you seem to understand the principles of 6 sigma here.…,5,
"We stayed here for 3 days to experience the Marina Bay gardens (excellent) and because it is an iconic hotel. First impressions were not good as it’s like checking in at an airport and the service is impersonal.  We acknowledge that it’s a large busy hotel but a smile doesn’t cost anything. The rooms are ok, standard business type rooms with a nice bathroom.  Requests for additional amenities were met very quickly and efficiently.  We had a great view of the gardens so could watch the light show. We preferred breakfast at Adrift to Rise as it was smaller with no queuing. The pool is amazing and wonderful at night. Part of the pool is adults only and this is enforced by the staff who were mostly friendly and helpful. Overall, a one off expensive experience.",3,
What an amazing place! Every staff member we dealt with were polite and went out of their way to accommodate us.   A special thanks to Josel from Spago who attended to us at breakfast. Also a big thank you to Chuan who cleaned our room each day.,5,
+ Amazing stay ! We'll come back again.  Really good location to visit the city. Close to the famous gardens.  The rooms with city view are amazing! A lof of restaurants all around.   - A little bit busy. Elevators are always full. Rooftop pool is really busy.,4,
I was staying with a young child so requested that the bar fridge could be emptied: the hotel wanted to charge for the full contents or i could hire another fridge.  The hotel is huge and is like staying in a airport.  All of the service desks have lines.  Good pool for great photos.  Stay one day then move on..,3,
"We just did a overnight and it was wonderful.  Our club room was just what we need.  Quite, a view, comfortable bed and fast internet.  We went up to the Roof Bar for cocktails.  The view and the drinks were great as well as the food.  The one thing that we did not like was this was open to the public who paid a price to come in.  There were children and the noise level was elevated.  We were looking for a quite time.  Breakfast was enjoyable.  We are looking forward to out next visit.",5,
Great hotel. We had a garden room . Room very spacious and large bathroom. Doors opened onto small balcony overlooking the gardens. Hotel has a stunning lobby and the architecture is amazing.  Plenty of bars and restaurants and the pool on the top is probably the most famous attraction. Very busy at times during the day so difficult to get sun beds.  Clubb 55 is very worthwhile and includes your breakfast and 2 hours late afternoon of canapés and drinks. Must have had plenty of champagne whilst waiting for a table . Drinks good and strong.Sevice was excellent and staff very attentive,5,
"We booked a couple of nights at the Marina Bay Sandys basically to have access to the infinity pool. That part was quite good and the view very impressive!  However, you do not have the impression that this is a luxury experience as the hotel amenities tend to get quite crowded and you end up queuing most of the time including for breakfast and even for taxis!  Even for checkin and checkout you can queue for over half an hour each time. You can of course go for the VIP service, but efficiency should really come as standard.",4,
"Recently went back to MBS after a few years and found that it was still a fabulous place to stay. Yes, it is a high end hotel, but well worth it! Found the room - garden view premium room to be fantastic - big, light and airy with a fabulous large bathroom with great amenities. The room service breakfast and dinner was fantastic and arrived much sooner than other hotels we have stayed in that were smaller and therefore one would assume lesser guests. Stayed in Tower 1 this time and found it was just as nice. The views from the rooms and especially the rooftop pool etc. are spectacular over the gardens and the City. Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking to stay in a great hotel with great service in Singapore.",5,
"Everything is quite average in general, the infinity pool is overrated. The breakfast is full of tourists and kids, food is ok. Room is ok with the view of garden by the bay. It’s quite a walk to city centre by subway or foot. I wouldn’t pay that much to stay here again unless its free.",3,
"The views ,particularly at sunset, are worth the trip. Buy a ticket for $20 Singapore, and take the lift to 57th floor. Once there you redeem your ticket for a drink at the bar. It can get a bit crowded so you might want to get there a little early. A lovely thing to do after walking all day.",5,
Hotel was good and service was great with huge mall to entertain ourself and infinity Pool was just an roof top pool with city view and our room was facing the harbour which was full of ships by the morning as it's near to the busy keppel and Over all experience was great but just an suggestion rooms require upgrades as toilet have no washing facility either you have to approach next shower area to clean your self lolx nothing to embrace about in sharing the experience and was scared to jump in the infinity pool when was thinking about some of the guests might never wash after using the toilet in room and make their way up to the pool anyways it's just the imaginations could be wrong and will visit you soon again and thankyou Marina bay for spectacular service.,4,
"We stayed here in transit thru SIN to experience the spectacular scenery from the rooftop pool and even that didn’t live up to the hype.   The lobby is architecturally stunning, but feels more like a large train station than a luxury hotel. Tina of people coming and going to nearby shopping with limited security for safeguarding elevators for hotel guests.   The club lounge has good food and bev but is a madhouse at 5pm when it feels like you’re waiting to enter a hip new restaurant. Who waits on line to sit at a hotel club lounge?  Pool views are terrific but the staff is bossy and the turnstiles to enter are uninviting.   In room experience - bathrooms are nice and spacey but bedroom is small. Worst is the very stiff and uncomfortable king bed that is probably. Loser to a…",2,
"It’s huge, it’s beautiful and a real must. The hotel is of amazing architecture. Never seen anywhere. Clean, spacious with final attraction the Skypark. You are on the57th floor but could as well have been on the ground floor for the gigantic pool, loads of sun beds. Pure luxury. Swimming in the open air with the pool finishing at the edge of the building gives a fantastic sensation. A bucket list item!",5,
"I stayed here for 2 night, room is similar  not special for hotel 5 * but clean and large, nice view by night. The infinity pool is beautiful. Best time to visit is to go early morning otherwise there is quite a crowd. The Marina Sands is basically next door to the Gardens By The Bay which you must visit",5,
"We stayed in Marina bay sands hotel for 2 nights , it was just amazing especially the infinity pool on 56th floor, we spent our mostly time there! Our room was spacious with lovely view of gardens by the bay. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. Hotel is so luxury . There is marina bay shopping mall under the hotel with most of high class brands. I definitely suggest this hotel to everyone is visiting Singapore.",5,
"$$$worth the money.  This was a treat 3-day stopover, after travelling through Europe. I personally wanted to stay at the MBS because of the amazing engineering/architecture and sheer exuberance. We were not disappointed. Amazing views from the 46floor ocean view with balcony. Room facilities were fantastic, room service just awesome. Food....OMG.  Infinity Pool just spectacular. Surrounding Marina Bay Flower Gardens, super grove trees, cloud forest, malls, I could just go on and on. She won't disappoint you!",5,
Stayed for 2 nights in a Club Room primarily to be able to use the sky park pool  Our room was amazing - huge with a great view back to the city. Very well appointed and spotlessly clean  Not the most personal of hotels - very much large Vegas style. But the club room staff were really good and always remembered your name after your first visit  The lounge has great views and the choice of food and drink is very good. Gets busy for evening drinks but we made sure we were there on time and always got a table with a great view  Pool was great for selfies but always very busy!,5,
"Becoming one of the iconic places of SG. Great modern architecture. Big complex including hotel, shops, and roof top bar. Easy to get to by the MRT. Infinity pool is spectacular. Ce la Vi bar on the top gives a magnificent view of the harbor and Downtown SG.",5,
We stayed here for 3 nights during our honeymoon. We stayed in a club room which I highly recommend as it gives you access to club 55 which serves afternoon tea 2-4 then evening canapés / drinks 5-7.  The staff are all very friendly and attentive making you feel welcome. The infinity pool is mind blowing and you must swim both day and night!  Make sure you visit the super grove trees / cloud forest / flower garden as they’re all walkable from the hotel.,4,
"Travelling as a family with teenagers and this is our first time to check-in to MBS. I have high expectations with this one considering all the reviews I’ve read and the price per night. But boy oh boy, every $$$ is reaallyyy worth it! The place was amazing, room given was superb, the staff in the check-in, room service and check-out counters were polite, helpful and professional.  A simple request though - i wish that they will install bidets in their toilets ☺️ for ease of use.  ",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is definitely in my top 3 of the best hotels that I have stayed in. Although there was a few hiccups it’s still an excellent hotel. We arrived early and I did notify them with an email before, they didn’t have a room ready for us however we was able to use the pool facilities and wow it’s the most incredible infinity pool ever. We spent a few hours there watching the sunrise, we asked a few times again if a room was available and we was told an hour each time, eventually because it was my wife’s birthday they kindly upgraded us to a suite facing the gardens by the bay.   The suite itself was lovely, spacious living room, bedroom and bathroom. Bathroom was equipped with Roberto Cavalli amenities, the bedroom had a luxurious king size bed and the gardens by the…",5,
Great place in singapore. We really enjoyed our visit there. Specially at night👍🏻 we really love.  The place and my friends really enjoyed their holidays. I would recommend this place to my other friends.,5,
"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for one night, I changed my connection home in order to check out this hotel for 2 reasons only, the infinity pool and Gardens by the Bay which is walking distance from the lobby, both did not disappoint. The pool experience offers great Instagram worthy posts, and Gardens by the Bay is spectacular. The hotel overall is busy, very busy. So busy that it could impact your experience especially if you are only staying one night or if you're someone who doesn't enjoy crowds. The hotel is very large and seeing only a small section of the grounds took time. If possible book a 2 night stay and upgrade to a room on the club floor. The club room access has additional perks (research the perks). Don't get caught up in choosing the right view when booking, all…",4,
"We got lucky! Jasvan Chin gave us an upgrade for being in our  honeymoon trip! The room view was breathtaking. We were able to watch the water show drinking champagne from our room. Besides access to the garden, and garden view at night in a special place for only guests, the pool is breathtaking! We got even luckier for being blessed with a perfect sunset! The only word I have to say is Thank you very much!!!",5,
"After coming from Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpur, my expectation of this hotel is that it should or must exceed the service level that an MO provides.   I cannot help but compare - Traditional vs Contemporary/Modern style, impeccable service or business as usual attitude. I guess the experience of just being in the most hyped hotel in Singapore is just what it is - dont expect anything more in terms of service as staff are way to busy to attend guests needs/demands (though the $600/nt room is way to steep).   Will I stay and come back at MBS again, maybe or maybe not - I will stay at Mandarin Oriental next time (hands down choice if you really are looking for classy elegance and welcoming service from its staff).  But to be fair, MBS has a great location, being a towering…",4,
"when you walk into the foyer of this hotel, it doesn't seem to be that fancy to be honest, incredibly busy, felt like we walked into an airport. as busy as it was, the check in was very speedy and organised. someone handing out bottles of water to those waiting in the line. We booked to stay for 2 nights at $500 a night, we asked about late check out as our plane wasn't leaving until 9pm that night and check out was at 11am. We had to pay an extra $370 for a late check out at 6pm, however, lady at reception decided to give us an upgrade and oh my goodness, how excited were we when we entered our room on the 44th floor!!! the most amazing view ever of Gardens by the bay and water views as well. It was just stunning. room itself was  massive, attention to detail with towel made…",5,
"Booked the hotel as a treat and mainly for the pool. Check-in was busy as expected so the helpful staff moved us to VIP check-in which helped and our room was ready within an hour. Had to pay a 200 Singaporean Dollar deposit per person per night which I didn't expect. Room was amazing with an unrivaled view, much better than I had expected or imagined.The pool was out of this world, thought it would be heaving but managed to get a sunbed and many more were free to choose from. They have a rule for people who leave towels and items on sunbeds if you are not back in 45 minutes they remove it. Took items out of the mini bar to put the room bottled water in and found out I had 6 pages worth of charges for taking items out without drinking or eating them. The staff did say they would…",4,
Would love to stay again. Most food in the breakfast has been delicious. The pool is great. But weirdly enough I enjoyed the lift the most haha it's just so fast.  The bed is so comfortable for me. Will be back,4,
"Everything was amazing. Our room was newly renovated and it was very comfortable, the staff was very efficient and attentive during our stay.   The views from the room are amazing.. even though the hotel is very big it doesn’t feel crowded while staying there. We enjoyed the pool for a whole day and it was great, the food and the service were on spot.  Special thanks to Ian and Wangelin who made our stay one of a kind! Next time we will definitely stay for more than one night.",5,
"Always be so curious with the famous infinity pool  in MBS, so i try to stay at this hotel with king size bed and city view at room 3703.   The room is big with abselutely beautiful view, but think for that price we can have better room interior design with bigger bed, selection of snack & drinks, a coffee machene or teapot in our room.  The infinity pool is abselutely awesome,  fun with great food and baverages and thousand dollar view,  though i think it needs a little more music.   And though i know MBS is a very big hotel with a lot of rooms i think the check in queque area need to be beautiful improved, it should be more managable with better queque look, i love that they give us manggo juice on our queue time and the cek in staff is polite. And helpfull.  I also have…",3,
"Such a beautiful place to stay , everything was so well organised and very clean! Our room had a view of the Gardens , at night time it was very beautiful ! The  infinity pool at the top is very cool and it wasn’t that busy as I thought it will be , it’s only for customers staying at the hotel , which is great ! We had Absolutely Amazing time there and already planning going back !!!",5,
"A true landmark in Singapore, a must stay hotel.   Lobby - massive lobby connecting the three towers, great atrium with awesome and funky feature pendants.  Skybridge - connecting to garden by the bay from Lvl 6. Room - spacious room with views - you need to ask for a high floor Service - couldn't fault it. Rooftop - bar and swimming pool   The rate is a bit high tho, at around AUD600 +.",5,
"Three towers bind a luxury mall of any city with a casino and a vast garden. If you end up here, its for the rooftop pool, which is the only way to gain access.  Each guest needs to have their own key card to tap in and out.  Good luck getting through the turnstiles otherwise.  As a hotel, its like any other large format, just longer ques to check in/out.  The rooms are large and may offer stunning views depending on your floor and side of hotel, but you don't come to Singapore to watch TV?  Depending on the weather your sending a few hours at the rooftop pool and garden.  Is that enough to support the higher rate?",3,
"The place is huge!  It has all the amenities you would expect in a 5* hotel.  My room came with the buffet breakfast at the conference rate, which I think was an additional SG$25; the rack rate is about SG$50.  There are lots of places to eat in the adjacent mall across the street, including a food court with local (Malay, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) food at reasonable prices (almost like eating at a hawker stall).  The Bayfront MRT station is close by.",5,
"If you do any type of research or read any reviews before booking this hotel it is exactly what you would expect. All reviews are pretty accurate as well as the pictures.  This is a huge hotel, run very similar to a Vegas hotel or a convention center. There are three towers that make up this hotel. When you arrive there is a line to check in, it moves quickly, but there is a line. It is similar to checking in at an airport, there are sectioned off lines and many people to check you in behind the desk. They give out small bottles of room temperature water while you wait. There is really no lobby, or places to sit. There is one long bench that seemed to always be full. We were upgraded to a room on the 14th floor of tower 3 with a nice big balcony. We had a wonderful view of the…",5,
"Room was fantastic Incredible views Pool was busy but not over crowded go plenty of space for pictures. There is an adult only section of the pool Staff exceptional in terms of friendliness and efficiency would recommend to everyone Checkin was very quick, we checked in around 17:00 as we had heard there were large queues when checkin opens at 15:00, we encountered a little wait but nothing  different from any other hotel.",5,
We treated ourselves for one night and it was a great experience. We had a beautiful suite with view on the supertrees and saw the light show from our window. We had breakfast at the restaurant Rise. There was so many options on the buffet it was hard to decide what to eat and the food was delicious. We also had in room dining which was perfect. The staff was great and really helpful. The only downside was the swimming pool. The view is outstanding but it's way to small for such a huge hotel. We tried to go at 4pm but it was full so we went again at 8am but same thing. We got our nice picture but didn't enjoy being in the pool. ,5,
"Great experience. Should say it was really sweet of the Hotel Manager to give us a great room with the room decorated for our wedding night ,also lovely flowers champagne and chocolates .Staff was courteous and helpful . Thanks for the wonderful stay .Will definitely visit soon . Thanks ",5,
"Arrived just after midnight to find we had to queue to check in, which was done with cursory efficiency, then had to carry our own bags to our room ! The room itself was a very good size with all the trappings one would expect from a hotel of this calibre, the only trouble was the noise from the road below, ok, we were on the 4th floor, but really? Went straight to the Ce LA Vie bar on the roof top - the service here is deplorable, it takes ages to get served and then with no personla service - I've had better service in a run down bar in the back streets of London !! To watch Singapore come alive at sunrise from the edge of the infinity pool and then to watch again at sundown were the only highlights of staying in this hotel. The queues for breakfast at any of the restaurants…",1,

"The iconic structure of Marina Bay Sands with a gigantic cantilever on top is very inviting for the idea of family vocation. We stayed at MBS with family and opted for club rooms. The place has its share of great pluses and disappointments. On The flip side it’s a big, plush hotel. Great food, super charged ambience and an outstanding infinity pool. The infinity pool is actually the shout factor!!! The club lounge is a nice big room but doesn’t offer variety of food to munch . Definitely not a value for bucks. The down side is the cold and on the borderline line arrogance of service staff across board . You are at The Marina Bay Sands could be a statement of warmth, hospitality and Guest relations but instead it comes across as rather un pleasant attitude which reflects snooty…",4,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands in April 2018 for 5 nights. We stayed in Tower 1 and was in the one of the end rooms on floor 17. The view from the room was of the city and our side the room door was the Gardens by the Bay. The room was very spacious (big bathroom), tea/coffee and water was refilled everyday. Everyone was very helpful and friendly.   The pool is just amazing (free pool towels) but can get busy at the weekend, the drinks and food was very nice and not to expensive by the pool.   We also had 1 dinner and 1 breakfast at Rise restaurant, the food was very nice but not that cheap. (If you get the Marina Bay Sands loyalty card then it’s half price and for the first meal kids eat free).   We walked pretty much everywhere but when we went to the airport, Sentosa and the…",5,
"My friend and I stayed here for 1 night as part of a three day visit to Singapore.  The hotel dominates the sky line of the city and whilst it is expensive, it is worth every penny as you are treated as a VIP from the moment you walk in.  We stayed in Tower 3 and our bags made it up to our room before we did.  Mark, our guest relations rep, talked us through all the features of our room and gave us his business card in case we needed anything during our stay.  Hotel guests get exclusive access to the famous infinity pool on the roof, so we took advantage of this for an afternoon. Pool side service is great although the cocktails, whilst excellent, are expensive ($22 for a singapore sling).  We had an early flight the next morning so had a rather rushed breakfast in the Rise…",5,
"I have just had the most fantastic experience at Marina Bay Sands,I booked to stay with family and friends for my birthday 1st May.We where checked in by Glenn who was professional,attentive who upgraded us to the most beautiful 2 bedroom suite via VIP lift. We were all overwhelmed by how beautiful and spacious the suite was.We spent the afternoon at the skypark where the staff made me a birthday card gave me a complimentary drink and served us to many of the cocktails we ordered.The pool manager (I'm so sorry I cannot remember is name insured we were well looked after. The evening meal in Ce La Vi was beautiful great staff and had the most gorgeous birthday dessert thank you. I had the most fantastic day and was made to feel very special,I feel blessed and most thankful. I am a…",5,
"If you enjoy modern architecture, you must visit this amazing property.  It has hotel rooms, casinos, shopping and the food selections are just immense.  Be prepare to spend a good amount of money but it is worth every dollar.",5,
"We decided to stay here on the last night of our Singapore trip at the Marina Bay Sands mainly so we could mark a bucket list item off and to say that we had swam in the infinity pool there however the service from the moment you walk in the door is an amazing experience, Your bags are collected when you leave your taxi , the porters give you a tag , Check in is very friendly and professional and whilst you wait they hand out bottles of water and mango juice. We arrived at 10am and check in is at 3pm and they said they could have a room ready for us in an hour and for a small fee they could upgrade us from a garden view to a city view. We accepted this offer,and it was definately worth it. they give you temporary swipe cards if you want to use the pool or skypark whilst you…",5,
"The hotel is first class, there is not the smallest detail that has escaped them. Despite having many people always, there is good space and gives to take advantage of the stay and the pool. The restaurants offer good food. A good experience, the only thing you have to take care of is the budget!",5,
"Our stay is Superb! From the excellent service, the beautiful building, the shops and lots of choices of great restaurant! Its just amazing! Plus the cleanliness of the place.. its been a fun and great time staying there.",5,
"Where to begin. If you’re reading this to hear/know about the facilities and cleanliness of MBS, than know its all A+ and most likely compliments all posts before this. Its MBS…. The pool is fantastic, food is amazing, rooms are clean.. there.. done. No, this review is about the magic of the MBS staff and in particular a shout out to 3 individuals.   First and foremost id like to recognise Mr Edmund Chong in the service management department. To say Edmund is amazing, is putting it very lightly. I wont go into the details but when others had said no, Edmund made my request possible. He took the time to listen to my problem, emphasised with me and then carried out my request. I mean, we have all had request met at a hotel before. But it was the ‘domino effect’ that occurred after…",5,
"Google Marina Bay and you'll get a million pictures of the Rooftop Pool. And yes- it's fantastic. There is SOOOOO much more to this hotel. I don't have great stuff to say about it. It's city center, attached to a 5 star shopping mall, has an incredible athletic facility, a rooftop pool with an unrivaled Singapore City View, etc, etc. Didn't get a room with the city view? No worries- the other side of hotel overlooks Gardens by the Bay- No big deal. I love this place. The major con: Price is crazy. I'm not sure how this is listed as the #21 hotel on TripAdvisor (it should be first) but if price is big to you, book it for a night or two and then go take one of the other ones. This place is basically it's own self sustaining city and everywhere you look you'll be mesmerized by its…",5,

We had an Amazing stay at  Marina Bay in Singapore on our way back from the Maldives. We stayed on the 37 th floor with a city view.  We opted for the Club 55 package and was worth every cent .  The breakfast delicious and the omelette chef made a perfect omelette every day.  The afternoon tea OMG just perfect especially the curry puffs yum with the most amazing view even with a spot of rain and then we had canapés and cocktails pre dinner in the Club 55 package .  We will definitely stay again anytime we are in Singapore.,5,
"Such a shame it was raining for the only night me and my husband spent here ,but overall we enjoyed the swimming pool even with the rain and few cocktails . Beautiful room and great service ,will be definitely be back ! ",4,
"This place was EXTREMELY OVERPRICED and nothing special for the money charged. Breakfast wasn’t included for a family room, which after services tax was over $1000 per night. Complimentary tea and coffee provided in the room, but when we asked for milk for the tea and coffee, we were advised it would be charged to our room at $4.00 for a small jug- now that is service!! Breakfast here will cost you $45 PER HEAD (PLUS the 17% service charges and tax on top). Makes it extremely unaffordable. Service is poor, staff are less than friendly and welcoming tourists to this city is certainly not a priority. Unless you have an abundance of money to spend on top of the high cost rooms, I would not recommend this place at all. Very cold and sterile.",1,
"After looking through sone travel groups to decide what to do in Singapore. We decided to spend one night at MBS.  This gave us the ability to experience the world's largest infinity pool and the night club on the 57th floor as part of our hotel stay.   Since our room was not ready,  we went to the fitness room to shower and change into swimsuits.   The pool did not disappoint!  The views were spectacular.    It was crowded but not overwhelmingly so.   It seemed a lot of people came to experience,  take photos and leave so we had space to lay out and take pictures until our room was ready.   We got an email that our room was ready around noon and the room was a great size with great views.     The club was nice,  but on the younger side.. again on the 57th floor so incredible…",5,
"Wow, what an amazing hotel and entertainment complex.  Despite the warnings, the check in was quick and very smooth.  Stayed in the Premium city view facing room which was spacious and brilliantly appointed.  The staff were fantastic right across the hotel and we had dinner at Adrift on the ground floor one night.  The food was Japanese fusion and very reasonably priced.  Drinks as always are expensive in Singapore.    As for the pool, it is after all the most insta photographed hotel view in the world.  We had breakfast at Spago on Level 57 one morning which was just beautiful.  Anyone who can afford to go to Singapore and stay in a 5 star hotel simply must stay at MBS at least once in their life.  We will be back!",5,
"Open for walk ins, the Marina bay sands is the most iconic buildings of the city and a hotel par excellence, one can make a prior reservation at the restaurant at the bay sands sky deck floor restaurant or alternatively chose to walk in the food court which is located in the lower ground floors of the hotel. A very wide variety of cuisines and not super duper expensive meals. No prior reservation required, the place closes by 10.PM (check for local closing time, I guess they have different closing time for summer and winters)",4,
"Stayed in hotel near Marina Bay.  The light show was excellent, and could be seen from our hotel window",5,
"Just checked out of our fabulous 1 night stay at MBS. Firstly just so you know we were upgraded from a £250 a night deluxe room to their best VIP 2 Bedroom suite costing over £3500 a night. Still not quite sure how this happened. Our suite had 2 bedrooms, huge lounge, kitchen, Cinema, In room gym and spa treatment room as well as an office over 330M2 in total. I hope this doesn't affect my review but an upgrade so drastic perhaps could. On arrival (Glenn) handled our check in very well indeed, very efficient, polite, knowledgable and dealt with all our questions and requests with utmost care. All pool and bar staff were very attentive, professional and friendly, we were always greeted with a warm hello, and excellent help in choosing our drinks. We had numerous drinks at the…",5,
