"Stayed here for my second night in Singapore. because of all the hype on the infinity pool.   The infinity pool is just amazing. Looking over Singapore CBD skyline, a view unforgettable. Singapore skyline is just so beautiful.  The hotel is of higher end but worth it!",5
I've been here so many times with family and friends but the most accomodating and nicest staff we have met is the one from VIP registration Front Desk officer Mr Sam! He answered all our needs and inquiries! Please give a good commendation to him as he deserves it! Kudos to him! Thank u Marina Bay Sands for the enjoyable stay we had last wk! Keep it up!,5
"I visited Singapore, never been before, and... loved every minute of it.   The last two nights of the trip included a much anticipated stay at Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Let’s be up front right from the start, this is NOT a cheap hotel. It’s not moderately priced either. It’s expensive, big and busy. So, if you’re on a budget I’d suggest looking elsewhere.   We’d saved for this and went full Monty. The room booked was an Orchid Suite with a city view. I don’t mind paying a little more for “nice” sometimes but MBS is a few notches up.   So, I was a bit nervous that given its global reputation, it may not even be value for money - rather, just overpriced.   End the anticipation; it’s worth saving for. On arrival, bags are immediately collected at the door and an efficient delivery…",5
We visited the observation deck that is on the top the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.  WOW!  What a view of Singapore!  There is a small cafe and gift shop and a photographer to take your picture.  Pictures were $69.  A bit pricey for us.,5
Time at a Marina Bay sands felt like a visit to a tourist attraction instead of a relaxing getaway. It is actually a tourist attraction and the sheer number of rooms is mind boggling. It starts with queuing up to check in like you would at any tourist attraction. It is well organised but the personal nature itself was lost. The family room was amazing and when within the room it felt great. The pool was over crowded and my husband said he saw snot floating around. It was selfie central. I recommend going up at 6 am before the crowds come in. Good to have visited but unlikely to stay again.,4
"Spent just one night whilst in transit but well worth the visit. Arrived at 9h00 and was accommodated with not only an early check-in (normally 15h00) but an upgrade as well. Our suite on the 43rd floor was spacious, clean and inviting. The views of the bay area were spectacular. Off course, the main attraction was the infinite pool and there was absolutely no disappointment.The view was wonderful and the illusion that you could swim over the top of a skyscraper was phenomenal. The warm jacuzzi offering views of the bay area on the opposite side was also very relaxing. The staff in all areas of the hotel were professional and very helpful. Service was prompt and efficient.",5
"Forget the lion fountain. his hotel is now the new icon of Singapore. On all the postcards, magnets, bags etc. you'll see this amazing hotel. We chose to spend one night here to try the swimming pool, like most of the other customers, I would say, considering how crowded it was. Still, it was a nice experience. Rooms were very nice and ours had a simply amazing view on the Gardens by the Bay. Really amazing.  Singapore is like",5
"Who does not want to be in the landmark of Singapore? This hotel is a fantastic architectural masterpiece. The infinity pool lies on top of the three hotel towers like a fish or a boat. But be aware that rooms are equipped spartan: One chair for a two bedroom is not enough. We also experienced an unseen insist on tips. Tired form a town walk a hotel boy knocked at the door and hold an undesired bag ful of tea, giving it only against an adequate tip.",2
"I love this hotel, is very big, many people and the swiminpool is amazing, you can stay all they in. The view i love. There is a good breakfast and the service is very good. The room is very clean and very good.",5
"Booked club level room. Clearly everyone staying there because of the pool. The pool was superb with excellent view from sun rise to night time. The catch is, it’s overly crowded. It’s always packed with people regardless what time you think you may have avoided the peak. Everyone is busy taking pictures, speaking loudly. They have tight security in place which meant it’s annoying to genuine guest as you have to touch in touch out n go through to this level then switch again for the pool etc.   Club lounge was so-so with poor variety of choices. It’s way less given this hotel is massive!  However I have to give them extra credit for providing in room breakfast for us with the full set menu if our choice as we have to leave early for our flight n the restaurant was not opened…",3
"I expected a lot from this place after reading the reviews but I suspect the hype has slight hot out of control. Yes, it’s an amazing building. Yes, the views are spectacular, and yes, the bed was comfy and linen gorgeous. But for those of us in the lower floors it’s noisy! Even with earplugs in I could here the constant drone of traffic on the highway outside. Updated joinery and glazing might help. Overall a great stay but needs some updating to match the hype.",4
I have been at the Marina Bay Sands for 8 nights in a grand club room with city view. This hotel is just simply fantastic and the staff are even more fantastic. I am returning in about three weeks before going back to the UK and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It’s just an awesome experience. Thank you to everyone at the Spago and club 55 for makeing my stay such a memorable one to cherish. Also the food here is great thanks to the chefs in club55. The rooftop infinity pool and bar(Que great bar person) are out of this world and the views by day and night are second to non. Simon,5
"I wanted to stay here so bad cause of the pool. We booked a room through agoda, the hoel policy is protery can have 2 adults and 2 children or 3 aldults. But we were told only 2, so one of us had to book another hotel. Check in time was so late, 3pm we were so tired of waiting cause we did go around 4 days ago before deciding rest here a day. View was great but the pool wasn't like my expectation. So crowded and staff was rude. I don't know, just feel wasting my money to stay here. Room price could take me a trip to Bali where is more beautiful, better service. Disappointed",1
This hotel is maybe the best that I have ever seen so far. The customer service was impeccable and the quality of the room was up to standard.   The swimming pool is on top of the building and is very exciting swimming over there.  YOu should be a guest in the hotel to have the access to the swimming pool.,5
Great views from the observation deck all across Singapore city. Worth the money to see such scenery plus being able to see the infinity pool. Only downside is there is nowhere to sit to take it all in,4
"We have just arrive home having stayed at Marina Bay Sands Hotel.  This is an amazing hotel and we had a Garden View.   All staff at the hotel was amazing and a few of them took the time to remember our name.  Our room was very spacious and clean.  We did ask for the top shelf in the fridge to be cleared so we can store water and our own stuff - they did so with no problems.  We also found the bed to be very comfortable.  The infinity pool is a whole new experience......we were there every day and did a little bit of swimming as well as taking selfies.  We tend to arrive around 4pm and didn't seem to be too crowded.  In the evenings, we would have coffee/cocktails at Renku and here we found the staff extremely friendly and knowledgable, especially Valentino.....he knows…",5
I suggest that this observation platform is a must see in Singapore. At $23 a head but $20 for seniors - with no need to provide identification - it is good value because it gives an unrivalled view of the city and a much higher one than the Flyer. If you plan on going to the rooftop restaurant then make sure that you get the voucher before you ascend. Otherwise you have to go back down to the ground floor in order to use the café.,4
"This hotel is definitely a must see! Our very first time in Singapore and simply put, I was impressed! MBS can be a bit overwhelming, but in a good way! There are lots of restaurants, eateries, and shopping but I always think it’s good to have options!  Upon our arrival, Grace checked us in with a smile, answered all our questions and even wished me a Happy birthday when she noticed this was my birthday month :) we were celebrating our honeymoon, and Singapore just happened to fall in our laps and I’m so glad it did!  Our room was a city view so we were actually able to watch the water and light show from our room every night! It was cleaned to pristine condition every day and if we needed anything, a phone call and five minutes later it was at our door! This was very shocking…",5
"Most Beautiful hotel in Singapore,World Class luxury you can find here.Marina Bay mall inside the hotel have many world class big brands shops ,Casino where thousands of people come and Play.Louis Vuitton showroom just outside mall adds luxury touch to the Marina Bay.Infinity pool provided top of the view of Singapore.Must place to visit Marina Bay if you are going to Singapore as its the middle of Singapore from where you can See Merlion Tiger Statue ,watershow and Night view of Singapore.",5
"This hotel is definitely one for the bucket list! The infinity pool was like nothing I’d seen before!  Staff were super friendly, rooms were nice and everything seemed pretty easy.  We had a room that overlooked the gardens so at night the view from our room was amazing!  Will definitely be coming back. ",5
"Came to the marina sands bay just for one night mainly to experience the outstanding view and the infinity pool and that was expensive but definitely worth it! The pool is absolutely amazing, the view is great during the day and night, the staff at the front desk and pool area were extremely kind and helpful, although the rooms are a little expensive i would recommend the harbor view or city view at the higher floors even for part of your stay - the view is just beautiful. Make sure you read deeply the terms and conditions for the infinity pool before ordering the rooms and try the non alcoholic coconut cocktail near the pool. At evening the spectra water show in frnt of the pool is a must! Overall- highly recommend!",5
"The service was average as any other 5* hotel - nothing extra ordinary. The room I had was on the 29 floor and the view was amazing from the room and it was facing the river.  The best highlight of the hotel was the amazing rooftop pool! Loved everything about it. it gets slightly crowded so, manage your timing well. The local and amenities was perfect.",5
"Most famous hotel in Singapore (or maybe in the whole World). The view is amazing from the top, the pool gives you a great refreshment.  The staff is helpful, but the the hotel is a bit too expensive for an average traveller.",4
It's a building that is iconic and one I pass by on my regular visits to Singapore. Stayed for a night as part of an anniversary trip. The experience was just a bit sterile. It's such a busy place that check in was highly functional and impersonal. I guess that's the consequence of 2400 rooms. The guest room was very clean and comfortable but again functional and not warm and inviting. Love the swimming pool and views. Expensive for what you get and compared to other luxury hotels in the city. Happy to have stayed there but will stick to my usual hotel in Clarke Quay,4
"Nice view, environment, location, staff and anything. This place just wonderful, actually I can’t write it all in here, even this columns is not enough to tell how i feel and how is my experience in there!!!",5
"The area is amazing. I would recommend going there at sunset so you could see it both during the day and at night. The views are stunning. If you go up, you'll see the rest of the city, if you go on the other side of the lake you'll find some very good spots for photos of the Marina Bay Sands, together with the Lotus. Wherever you choose, it's too beautiful to be missed.",5
"We stayed here last year during the Singapore F1 Grand Prix and had a very enjoyable time. We decided to stay again this year and booked what we thought was a similar room. Last year we stayed on level 35 and enjoyed excellent views of the city and the bay and when we booked this time asked the travel agent to book us on at least level 20 or above and with views of the bay, rather than the gardens. We were told they couldn't guarantee either the level or the side of the hotel on even though we were booking 9 months in advance!! When we arrived the agent on the desk said he would see what he would do about getting the best room available as we were staying for a week - we ended up on level 12. Nice enough room, but nothing special, especially for the price. The week went well,…",4
"The view at the pool is breathtaking and the club room is the best and the most spacious around. The breakfast spread is good and the crowd is well managed. Also, it has the best smelling shampoo and liquid soap! I would say expect the best for everything, the bed, the food, the sound proofing, the bath etc.",4
"We had a Premier King City View Room. Loved this place. Location was outstanding, service was really good. Quality was great, I used the gym and thought it was fantastic and the service there was good too. We used the roof top pool a couple times and my fiancé loved it. Only downsides were the price of course (but you expect it for this and just treat it as a special occasion) and the fridge in the room was full with for sale products and as soon as you remove them you get charged and there’s no room for our stuff...you have to pay $10 to rent another fridge. Also if they could find a way to stop people just leaving their towels on the pool deck chairs all day then that would make it more fair for everyone.  Overall though I don’t give many 5 star reviews but am happy to here.",5
"Pleasantly surprised by the sheer size of the room, variety of yummilicious food at Club 55 and helpfulness of the staff... the room was very clean and tidy.. easily fitted our family of four.. though one thing to note is that there is no lock for the bathroom.. ",5
"I have to say its a beautiful place to visit and chill. The only issue, its hard to find a place to park our bike. However , the main point I would love to highlight are the service of management team as they have been very helpful and professional with their work. During my visit here a week ago, my friend had lost his wallet. Some of the employees in the future world gallery did help me to look around.Honestly its a little hard to find a really good service in Singapore compared to other country I have visited. Anyway,there is one particular person I would love to thank from the security team member  whose name is Rajes for reporting my lost wallet to the team immediately and updating me the status of my lost wallet. Fortunately, the wallet is found on the day itself at an…",4
"Great location, Fantastic pool and sky deck it is really the best thing about this hotel.  The rooms are clean and tidy but not fantastic. Make sure you get a city view room for a great view.  Handy if you love gambling as it sits ontop of the casino which is open 24 hours. Its also right next door to the Shoppes which has every designer store you can imagine and more.",4
"We stayed here for one night. We reached early and were given a room at 9 am. We had to however compromise with a lower floor room with no view but with kids we opted for that. However getting a room at 9 am was amazing with no extra charge.  Hotel is huge and you have many things to do within and near by the property. The only benefit you get of staying in this hotel is you have free access to sky view and infinity pool. Sky view is open for outsiders with a paid ticket but infinity pool is only for hotel guests. You have easy access to the mall, gardens by the bay and science art museum. Breakfast is the most lavish I have had. Their chefs are amazing and full marks for that.  I however felt that the rooms are slightly highly priced and if you are not keen on the infinity pool…",4
"We stayed for just one night at this hotel. Our experience overall was not a good one. It is a massive complex - 3 hotels combined into one. The foyer is much like a vast shopping mall with all the noise and hustle and bustle that goes with such an establishment. Check-in was slow and ponderous, we had to queue in a line that felt as though we were in a supermarket. The room was comfortable with good views over Singapore and we were ideally situated to observe the impressive light show at 8pm from our room. Facilities in the room were adequate but no more than I would expect for a so-called 5 star hotel. There is no turn down service which is surprising given the rather expensive nightly cost of this hotel. The customer service at this hotel is poor to say the least, we did not…",2
I stayed at this hotel a while ago and yeah nice view average room cool pool ( I thought I would fall off the pool and die) but oh ma lord the price on this hotel is hiiiggghhhh you can get nicer hotel. Final conclusion ........ bad value,3
"This was our first time at this hotel and wow what a place! We booked into a Premium King Sky Room and very impressed. We were in tower 1 on the 40th floor (4075 is a good room for views). We had a great view of across the city and bay right in front of the laser light show that is on every night. The restaurants there were also great (for a different review) but what stood out for us was the service. We splashed out for this hotel for my birthday (15th) and we booked a restaurant. The concierge asked if it was a special occasion and my wife mentioned my birthday (no big deal for me just happy to get away somewhere). This was obviously relayed throughout the team because that afternoon, a couple of staff turned up at our room with a bottle of champagne and a cake. They even sang…",5
"The infinity pool and the hot water pools are a must Great to chill out with a drink  Feel relaxed and chilled out A must visit in a life time Casino is fun,rooms are big and modern with all amenities  Great place to shop and lots of choices available ",5
"Obviously in a minority with my views - superficially it is wonderful and would provide most things that many would love. The rooms are a reasonable size, are clean and well presented. HOWEVER: being so large, everywhere is a huge distance to walk, whether you go to the restaurants in the casino building, or perhaps a walk to the Gardens by the Bay, every aspect is inconvenient. The lifts are a nightmare - huge numbers of people stay here, they have few lifts operating and consequently they stop at so many floors and are very slow. For the gardens, you actually have to do a circumference of the hotel to then go in the opposite direction for the gardens - very poor design, While the swimming pool is a huge appeal, hard to actually swim; everyone is in the pool to do selfies of…",3
"Location is amazing to visit the Marina, as well as Merlioz, gardens, city, etc. Wonderful views, spectacular building. Very poor and low quality breakfast. Swimming pool is a mess. 2.400 bedrooms says it all. ",3
"눉Furniture is getting old. At check in we booked for 4, 2 adults + 2 kids, and paid for it. However, room was only 1 bed for 4. The receptionist went to tell us a long story about trying to find a solution. In short no 2 queens in 1 room, end up with a sofa bed. Ok, but cut us the crap or do not sell rooms for 4   눇Location is great, in the middle of what we wanted to visit. Great shopping mall, food quartiers, great views (we were on sky view bedroom +40). However, breakfast was terrible expensive for what is offered which is 3 star quality. Food was not extensive, no good quality. Pastry awful. Swimming pool has outstanding views but is a total mess with so many people attracted that is like going to a street demonstration, not pleasant, not enjoyable, yes views. Pass. Not…",3
"Building is iconic and the rooms nice, but the hotel is incredibly expensive and fails to deliver on some the basics.  Internet is TERRIBLE - you constantly need to login again. And one of the 2 keys I was given at check in never worked and the other one failed during my visit. Colleagues had similar experienced.  Unfortunate. ",1
"The service was just great, wonderful staff. very reliable butler service. Good choices food choices during breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails at Club55. plus the scenic view of Singapore from everywhere (suite, Club55, Skypark, Infinity Pool). ",5
"Choose to stay here if you want to experience pure luxury, fun and to tick an iconic building off your bucket list.   We chose to stay here while traveling from Europe to New Zealand. We got off a long flight and were exhausted. From the moment our taxi pulled up at the door we were treated like royalty. Everything was simple, efficient and felt very personable for such a mega-industry. Our receptionist upgraded our room to a suite which was spectacular. I loved our time there and would stay again.   The best parts: The building itself is spectacular. The rooftop pool is amazing and not as scary as anticipated. Great for photos! The suite has beautiful spacious rooms and many amenities. The staff were all very courteous. The hotel is also adjacent to a lovely mall with many…",5
"An iconic hotel with epic form with plenty of glass to public areas. Lofty majestic spaces, good sized rooms with great views of the harbour.  Adjacent is the convention centre and a shopping mall boasting an almost endless array of shops with overpriced materialistic purchases. The hotel has three towers with a common central atrium at ground level which can be accessed from the street at either end. The Internal atrium provides direct access to the marina bay sands shopping complex and gardens (lift is outside on the shopping mall side).  Hi speed lifts to clean and spacious rooms. Bed was near the harder end of the scale, pillows soft, air con a little noisy, sliding glass doors to a small balcony, great views mine being harbour facing looking over the gardens.   The Infinity…",5
"I was so happy with my experience and would really recommend this hotel to everyone!! I have stayed in a few five stars hotels and never have I ever experienced the service that I got at marina bay. It was superb from start to finish. I am currently travelling the world with my boyfriend so you could imagine how we rocked up to check in, casual wear and big rucksacks! I thought we'd be a little out of our depth and frowned upon but we had the opposite! The hotel was so welcoming and a gentlemen immediately come up to us to take our bags whilst we checked in. As you can imagine Singapore can get very hot, whilst we were waiting in a short queue we were offered drinks and complimentary ice-creams which was a lovely surprise. We checked in nice and easy and the lady that checked us…",5
"MY husband treated me to two nights for my 60th..... OMG what an experience.   I cannot praise the staff highly enough for their attention to details and service and friendly and so helpful.  OKY it was expensive and we went for the package that included afternoon tea, drinks and canapés .... all you can eat.  What a superb selection. The presention.  Oh and those views from the 56 floor.  Absolutely stunning whilst being. Pampered.   Oh, and in that cost was access to the infinity pool etc.    Then we got to our room.....OMG..... the views. The room was stunning .... the decor, the luxuriously exquisite accessories, the stunning bathroom.... all I can say is I wish I could win the lottery to stay for weeks.   We love it.   We are having another stay next year when i return for…",5
"One of my bucket list fulfilled! Had a great time enjoying the views of garden by the bay through my hotel balcony.  The infinity pool is a must try for some instagram worthy poses. Great facilities, superb staff.  I will be glad to come back with the whole family!",5
stayed at the hotel for 1 night to break up the flight from WA to the UK. when booking a couple of months ago i did state that our flight was a n early one and would arrive at Marina Bay approx 8am and to the hotels creditr they did reply saying that they would have a room ready for us if one was available when we got there. guess what? there was no room ready but was told to go back to reception at 10am as they would have a room for us!! we booked the luggage in and with a tempory pass we we able to go upto the roof to use the pool facilities and order food and drinks if we wanted. we had seen pictures and read reviews about the roof's infinity pool and we were not diappointed. we ordered some drinks which my wife had a Singapore Sling at 9am!!!  went back down to reception at…,4
"I stayed at this hotel on a business trip.  Let's just say that this is definitely one of the best hotel in Singapore, if not, the best.  Everything is excellent.  The room is spacious, fully carpeted. Furniture all in very good condition. The bed, pillow, comforter are all very comfortable. Good facilities.  The toilet doesn't have a bath tub...at least in the room that I was staying. They provided good amenities.  We stayed in Tower 3. There are 3 towers for the rooms.  The infinity swimming pool at level 57 is a must to visit, especially at night. The view is breath taking.  There are 3 restaurants to choose from for breakfast. They are either at Tower 1 or 2 area. None in Tower 3. Breakfast selection is excellent.  The hotel is connected to the MRT - just a quick walking…",5
"5 stars, 10/10. I admit being slightly skeptical after reading reviews on here, but this place blew away all expectations. The building itself is amazing, and you could spend hours just staring at it.   From the moment we checked in, everything was easy. We stayed in a club room with city views, just excellent. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, I seriously could not fault a single one.   Club 55 was spectacular for breakfast and evening drinks and nibbles. For anyone who enjoys a beer, it is absolutely worth paying the extra money to have two hours of drinks included every night, alcohol is expensive in Singapore and you will more than get your money's worth with the club rooms. The view is spectacular and the staff amazing.   The pool is awesome, I don't…",5
"Thank you Marina Bay Sands for the excellent hotel experience my family had! Great room for my family of 4, fantastic staff, and awesome facility! Though it was only an overnight stay we didn't miss out on anything an ordinary family staycation could ever have experience especially my kids love, LOVE, love everything! The view it to die for!!! Thank you MBS for such an exceptional experience! Hoping for yet another come back in this hotel! ",5
"We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands for a night at the end of our holiday. As others already noted in their reviews the check-in process is rather quick. Our luggage was brought to our room (on the 27th floor) within 15 minutes. Unlike other reviews, we found the staff members to be really friendly and helpful. Also, we were addressed by name - which is the maximum you can expect in such a big hotel. Our room was of a decent size and quite modern, everything was in a good state and very clean - just as you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. When we tried the infinity pool we quickly found free deckchairs and were provided with towels. The view is amazing for sure! In-room dining worked quite well as well, was tasty, perfectly prepared and well priced. Wifi is available for free…",5
"We arrived on Oct 7 around 2pm. it's chaos at the tower entrance. We had to roll our luggage in and while I waited for my husband who's trying to check in, no one came to help carry luggage. As I stood there, a lady with a cart that looked like kitchen ware came by and instead of wheeling around me, she looked at me to signal that I needed to get out of her way at the concierge. I did.  As with everybody else who comes to this hotel, the pool was the purpose, so there were lots of ppl.  The pool was closed in the middle of the day when everyone wanted to go in...around 3 to 4pm with thunders and lightnings on Oct. 7. 2017. We returned later at 7:30pm and at 9pm and there was no towel services. The next morning, we went to the pool again and there was no services either. You need…",4
"Yes, I had expectations! I stayed at this hotel with the purpose of experiencing the architectural/engineering side of such an amazing building. Too bad the hotel aspects are so disappointing: filthy rooms, dirty swimming pool, total unpersonal reception.  Everything is administrated as a huge playground for big groups with lots of kids. Not the place for singles or couples looking for a luxury relaxing place.",2
Check in was speedy but the customer service was abrupt and rather rude. The premier room was well furnished and spacious with quality amenities and a great high floor view of the city. Beds super comfortable. We requested a baby cot which was not available because it's a first come first serve basis and because we checked in late we had missed the boat! We booked 5 months ago!  45 mins of complaining through 4 levels of managers and finally we get a cot. Not impressed.  Staff were all very friendly and professional. Food in all outlets over the 4 days was good. Roof top infinity pool was the highlight of the stay but not as wow as we expected.  Not sure we would stay again yet we would recommend for a one night stop over to tick the box with the city view and pool.,4
"I wont take away from the fact that this place is worth visiting once in your life and probably just for one day as i did. It is ridculasly expensive to stay there for even one night i paid 550 Singaporian Dollars for one night with roof top pool access. End of the day it felt merely like a status symbol and nothing more..   unfortunately our trip to this hotel felt ruined by the way the customer care staff spoke with us on the phone when we were needed to check out, but i guess it was just one those days and we got caught in it.   The managerial staff was helpful and resolved the situation",3
"I was my first time I had stayed in such an expensive hotel. I questioned myself continuously asking, ""At my age should I be spending this much money on a hotel room??? ""  But oh my goodness it was worth it!👌👌  They had actually started a new system when we arrived and check in took over 1 hour and the line was massive and continuously growing (I felt sorry for those who had come straight from the airport they must've been exhausted after their plane ride to stand for hours) However even with the system issue they were VERY professional. Handing out water, walking around to speed up the process as much as possible and asking people if they're okay!  In the end we got a room upgrade with a fantastic view! (I'm sure everyone else did too) I swear it was right in the middle and…",5
Too much people flowing around. good verbiage used but sounds “fake”. Restaurants food are nice but kind of pricey.  For a visit walk is good. Not for stay. Gardens by the bay are nearby walking distances ,3
What more you want to say . The greatest Place in Asia . Superb and stars on All elements . A Place must visit . Bit expensive but worth it . We had several Meals and snacks + drinks with friends over few days and thought to stay for overlong,5
"A perfect location for a visit of 1/2 nights, the time to take advantage of the infinity pool and one of the best view of the city. The reception is crazy but it's really efficient: we arrived in the morning and the room was not ready but they gave us a key to access to the infinity pool and the view terrace! The room was at the Tower 3 with a nice view of the botanic garden.",4
super awesome and great view from the top. Need to pay a fee to go to the roof for photos but worth it. lots of shopping option in the same building. the station is bayfront station and is accessible via the blue line.,5
"We booked a club55 room, breakfast included, for us and my daughter and once we arrived (after 12 hours flight), at reception they informed us that we need to pay for the child as nothing is included!!!!! Even it was completely differently booked.  Besides this, the breakfast is the same every morning, still with club 55 you have 3 restaurants. The rooms are cleaned but questionable. The view is fantastic but you can come only for this, no need to book the hotel.  There is a GAP between this hotel and similar hotels, same category of prices.",3
"This a spectacular hotel. The view of the bay is breathtaking.  We were on floor 30 facing east and you can see the Garden by the Bay outside our window. A few things you should know: 1. You are paying for the view. 2. You are paying for the convenience of the HUGE connected shopping mall, casino, expo center, restaurants and transit system which you can walk to (all indoors). 3. There is a stunning infinity pool. Bring your swimsuit and sunscreen. 4. The housekeeping services are great. 5. The concierge will make reservations for tours for you (I recommend the night safari). 6. You have the amazing marina bay walkway for sightseeing and a leisurely stroll. Make sure to see the light show (at night and get there early). 7. The architecture of this building is amazing to see and…",5
"We stayed here primarily for the pool and it was worth the experience   The service is exemplary and location is great. In the right rooms the view of the gardens at night is amazing but its really all about the rooftop  Its pricey, to stay and eat / drink but justifiable for a short stay  ",5
"SO let's be honest, if you're looking at this hotel, its probably for the skypark/pool. And rightfully so. it is an amazing architectural wonder with amazing views and an awesome pool. And you should stay here, for one night, to use that. then you should move to a higher quality, lower cost hotel for the rest of your stay in Singapore. That may seem brutally honest, but this hotel has no redeeming qualities. From drop off to check in their is nothing personal about the experience. You are just a number staying in their hotel. (much like staying at the large Vegas casinos) The rooms are very stark, with the only ting making them feel like a person has every stepped in was a towel animal. OF course a large property like this means lots of walking, so be prepared for a lot of…",3
"There are so many people, but checkin/ concierge process everybody very quickly. You sort of feel like cattle at checkin but it does the job. A world of amenities; although a bit far from Singapore central.",4
"When I arrived, I had to share the room 1 day with my work colleague. Once we entered the room, the curtain opened and we saw the perfect garden view. It was shocking in a positive way.  The other days, I changed to an individual room, and was the opposite view but also amazing! The swimming pool with infinite view is so beautiful! The skyline, the city view from there, are almost magical! The is a Ce La Vi restaurant at the rooftop, as some other restaurant.  The only thing I didn't like so much, is not having a place for breakfast. Yoi have to chose between some of the restaurant at the ground floor.",5
"We stayed at this hotel 2 days  in a very nice and expensive suite with a nice view over the city. The infinity pool is perfect, the stuff around is really friendly, the hotel itself is situated perfectly and you can reach some important attractions from here (art science museum, gardens by the bay, Merlion, flyer...). For the shopping lovers this hotel is also perfect. Nevertheless only 4 points because during our 2 days stay we had to call them 3 times as they forgot things agreed before, like Champagner & strawberries or the evening service.",4
"We stayed in this hotel for one night, on Friday. Overall we were very happy with our  stay. I just wish the prices were slightly lower as we paid stupid amount of money, just because it was the weekend. We chose this place mainly for the pool. Check in went smoothly and fast. Rooms are very nice but nothing what I haven’t seen before. We have received higher floor room but with Gardens by bay view, which was still amazing, and it had small balcony. The pool area is well secured, you need your room card to get in and out and there are always 2 members of staff by the entrance.    Water in the pool was rather cold which was surprise, I would expect heated swimming pool for the price I have paid! There is always plenty of people at the pool, at night and during a day but we still…",5
"I and my wife visited the hotel, and this is our dream hotel to stay during our honeymoon. Our expectation have met when our front staff Mark gave an excellent services to us. During our check in, he gave us warm hospitality, a great smile, very friendly attitude,  and a surprise amenities and gestures. I will recommend this hotel, the pool and skypark is perfect, room is very big and has a nice view. Thank you MBmarina Bay Sands. ",5
"Large rooms. Great breakfast with western and chinese food. The stasf was very helpffuly and calm. Rapid check-in. Express check-out We stay at Tower 1, 33 th floor. The views ate excellent. We will repeat!",4
"We - my wife and our two kids, 9 and 12 yrs., - stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for two days only. The pool area and the view from the roof top are spectacular and beyond compare. Rooms are nice and tidy, but not really outstanding. The breakfast was not really cheap, but worth the money.  What was really disappointing is the very unusual price policy of the hotel. My wife and I traveled with our kids and, thus, booked for 2 adults and 2 kids (and our email confirmation is for 2 adults and 2 kids). The room, however, only had one single king size bed, which was not really spacious enough for four people. Raising this to the reception, we were told that an extra bed would be charged at S$ 100 and that we would also need to pay the ""additional"" breakfast for the kids. We were also…",3
"You cannot missed this hotel when you are going to visit Singapore. Inside and outside of the hotel are wonderful. The hotel is famous because of the Infinity pool and it's amazing three towers. The hotel have shopping mall, theatre, celebrity Chef restaurants, skypark (observation deck) and attractive rooms. In addition you are getting a good service everywhere in this hotel. You come to MBS and experience it yourself 👍🏻👍🏻  PS. Hotel nearby to any public transportation and to any tourists attractions. Nearest would be gardens by the bay",5
This is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. The three towers feature a rooftop garden and infinity pool. There is also numerous restaurants and a fabulous casino. The rooms are extravagant and offer incredible views. It is a pricey location though well worth it. ,5
lovely hotel very clean but be careful it is expensive especailly if you like a bottle of red wine the cheapset bottle was 50 singapore dollars and even outside the hotel to eat and drink it was just as expensive something to do with a double tax on alcohol . if i do this trip again i would stay in another not so expensive hotel but you defiantly need to experience the roof top infinity pool which you can do for about 15 singapore dollars if you are not staying there. I would also recomend you stay slighty more in town/city as you need to get taxis every where and this also is expensve.,4
"Great view, Food can be improved not many to choose from. Overall food quality is above average. With the price We expected better quality.  The journey up to 57th floor is a bit troublesome. Queue was Long, no chairs for elderly to rest while waiting.  The restaurant que was blocking the lifts lobby, we had some difficulty while waiting to take the lifts. ",4
"So........we went for the pool.......really!! Just hordes of people standing in the water taking photos of themselves. We should have known better. Just not worth it. Checking in or doing anything involves a slow queue, the staff are efficient but there are not enough of them. The wait time for everything was ridiculous.  The security is good though, you can't do anything without your keycard and/or passport so despite all the people it seems safe.  The rooms are comfortable, the a/c terrible, the view magnificent, room service great and overall it is a very good hotel, just too big for us. ",4
"The decoration for the room was nice, the bed was comfortable, and the view was fantastic. The staff was friendly and the check in process was fast . Besides, a lot of nice restaurant and entertainment casino there was the best match.",5
"My husband and I came to Singapore many times for business. We stayed at different hotels each time. Marina Bay Sands is certainly something we don't want to miss. This hotel has opened many years and this time we finally decide to stay here, after staying at several fascinating hotels which we repeatedly returned.  This hotel lobby has many people and feels very busy. Many tourists come even they are not staying guests. But the pool is reserved for guests only. We enjoy the pool especially at night. It is fascinating to enjoy the Singapore night view from the pool.  The mall nearby is not crowded and it's quite nice to walk around before the water area to have some chilly air after a day's heat.   I like a quiet place so this hotel isn't my cup of tea. But I think the swimming…",5
"After hearing so much  about Marina Bay Sands I was expecting a lot. It was expensive with the most uncomfortable beds (unbelievably hard). Mould in the shower was also  nasty,It's two redeeming  features were the great shops and restaraunts. The pool has amazing views but way to busy and forget getting a lounge chair.",2
"It is such a pity for this property, the talent that is so abundant, and a management that, somehow cannot hold such positive attributes together to deliver a great experience. I have come to Singapore for the past 12 years, and taken guests/family to many places in Singapore. This property is a landmark, and with some of the best views, the best chefs (and highest prices), you might expect great value for money- but sadly, Chinese food, Fusion food, do not match the flair of the menu or match the view. Specifically, spending over $200 USD for two of us to have a light snack and 2 drinks....was very disappointed. Service took over an hour, steam leaf pau was soggy....how does that happen?, how does such a simple component of a dish, steam for a few minutes, but over an hour…",1
I stayed in Marina bay sands with my friends for 2Days it was a great experience by staying in this hotel and the pool in the top floor was very nice and rooms are very clean lobby was very good totally it’s very good hotel ,5
"My family recently stayed here for my wife’s 65th birthday. Everything from the moment we arrived (the day after the F1 Grand Prix unfortunately) till we checked out was perfect. It wasn’t cheap but then we never expected it to be and no way it could be with the level of service provided, but what an experience. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and polite and the hotel itself is magical especially the infinity pool and sky bar. It’s a must visit place at least once in your travels.  We had dinner in CE LA VI restaurant on the 57th floor for my wife’s birthday which overlooked the spectacular Singapore skyline and the entire evening was made special by all the staff.",5
"Location of this hotel - Just too good Why - You have everything around it - Forest Moutain, RIver Cruise, Laser show, Gardens by the bay -  And believe me, you will love each one it. Singapore is a good balance of nature(river, sea bay) and many made artifacts(as I mentioned above). Even though it is a commercial capital of Asia, I rate it quite high from tourism standpoint. You have tons to do in this hotel and area around it.  And on top of it - its a completely safe place !!",5
"This is a huge, corporate, impersonal monster.  The rooms are wonderful, large and well appointed BUT it is almost like being in a robot hotel.  No personal service, no sign of any management to deal with problems, i.e. long queues at the 3 restaurants for breakfast.  The distances from the 3 towers to the restaurants is huge and the lifts (elevators) too few, the wait for a lift was unacceptable.  One person who did make a huge difference was the concierge, nothing was too much trouble and he went the extra mile to ensure we had a great time, other staff should emulate him.",4
"Rooms were amazing, very well kept. Stayed here for 4 night, for the first stage of our honeymoon before flying onto Bali. Such an impressive building and the views from the swimming pool have to be experienced in person to believe. Food was very good too, staff were very friendly. Only disappointing thing about our stay was our honeymoon wasn't even acknowledged, was no special little touches to make the stay even more special.",5
"Had a super memorable stay,  worth mentioning in particular was the kindest Security / Lobby attendant,  one of those people who make you come back for dispite being this gigantic mass tourism hotels Management please acknowledge with merit: MR ANDREW KONG TM 817981",5
"Marina Bay Sands was so much more than just a hotel.  It was huge, extravagant, and impressive.  It was basically a city within a hotel.  Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly, accommodating, friendly, attentive, and all-around wonderful.  The rooms were luxurious, the pool deck was sublime and an incredible experience.  We truly enjoyed our short 2-night stay at the Marina Bay Sands with our toddler.  The luxurious and iconic, Marina Bay Sands with its stunning Sands SkyPark Infinity Pool, was what fueled our desire to stop in Singapore during our journey home from Australia.  The SkyPark Infinity Pool is the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool.  The pool rests above the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands on floor 57 and towers over the bay.  We selected to spend two…",5
"Ever since Marina Bay Sands opened, I have always been wanting to go back to Singapore and try it out because of so much publicity and good reviews about it. When we decided to go to Singapore to celebrate my son's 7th birthday, we included an overnight stay at the this hotel to try it out.   We booked for a Grand Club Room. The booking included breakfast for 2 adults only. Kid's breakfast was around S$25. Extra adult breakfast was at S$45. Our check-in was at the club lounge since we booked for a club room, so we did not line up at the main lobby. Check in was smooth, and we were given extra adult keys since I have a 12+ son. The other 2 kids got their own keys, too.   Each person gets a key because it's your access to the pool and the sky park. If you think you can get away by…",5
"The room rate is higher than other 5-star hotels in Singapore and despite the price, it's not exclusive due to the crowd of guests everywhere, from the lobby to the lifts, the infinity pool and the breakfast restaurants.  But, it's got the best view you can get in Singapore, because the other comparable hotel, Swissotel the Stamford (tallest hotel in Singapore), is not as near the bay.  Most of all, I love it that I can enjoy the scenery outdoors in natural air at the sky deck and infinity pool.  Whereas at other hotels, you'll probably be looking only from behind the window glass.  Whatelse I love :  * Gym - Breathtaking view with Marina Bay right below and the Merlion in the far distancel.  The unobstructed view stretched so far that I could see the hills faraway << you see,…",4
This is a must see thing to be done when your here as it is just spectacular at night time. The view is sensational from the top. The light show from surrounding buildings are awesome to view. The cost can vary if you do your home work before hand just a tip?. ,5
"We had 3 night stay here and arrived very early on our check-in day. Despite this, the room was ready and perhaps because it was early, did not have to wait long at all to check-in. The room itself was spacious however it felt a little dated despite its age and a little characterless, with empty spaces that could be used for more furniture.  The bed was really comfy and being on the 45th floor, not only did we have a great view but it felt very peaceful. The view over the city was amazing and we were in a great spot for the water light show. All the staff very friendly but because of the size, the service wasn't at all personable.   The pool is really a wow factor despite lots of tourists taking many selfies which was annoying! The hotel is in great proximity to the transport…",4

"Am here to attend the TechXLR8 Asia conferences. First time attending conference at MBS Convention Centre. Positive experience. Spacious, with adequate washrooms, signages and sitting areas around the halls. There is also ample car parking space.",4
"Stayed here for 2 nights and that was enough. I was expecting 'Grand', but its just another Big Hotel. Don't get me wrong, glad I got the opportunity to stay here but I found it too big, too expensive and just like a Nice hotel. I stayed here with my husband and 2 kids in a Twin room. I expected the beds to be bigger but they were just a King Single. So it was squishy to say the least. The room was a decent size and the bathroom Huge. Big bath tub and a shower next to it, The fridge is weight sensitive, take something out and you brought it. NO room to put anything else in it. So you cant buy a drink to put in it or even a chocolate bar of your own, I didnt like that. We stayed in Tower 1 on the 15th Floor. We arrived at 12.30pm and could go into our room straight away. I had…",3
"We could not fault this wonderful hotel. Arrived at 7.30 am and were permitted to go to our room, which was wonderful after 12 hours overnight from Rome. We paid extra to stay on an Executive Club floor with city views and the room and view were incredible. Access to the Club 55 Lounge was included with breakfast, afternoon tea, then canapes and drinks later. Well worth it. The food was high quality. The staff were all very welcoming, sociable and efficient. The pool is the jewel in the crown with the best views of Singapore. Also just a short stroll to the magnificent Gardens by the Bay, as well as shopping. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys a luxury hotel experience.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is not what it used to be. The rooms are not up to date anymore, you get better rooms and service for a lower price in Singapore. I would not recommend to stay there, maximum one night to enjoy the infinity pool at the deck. However there are cheaper hotels with better service and more modern rooms. ",3
Everything about Marina Bay Sands is incredible. From the hotel to the rooftop pool to the club scene. The view from the rooftop is worth going for alone. We stayed at the hotel most nights and just reserved a table and had bottle service instead of going to the city. ,5
Hotel was incredible. Iconic infinity pool and Spago Restaurant on 57th floor were awesome. Views of city and port were best in Singapore. High tech hotel with everything a person could desire available on the premises. Great location for everything I was interested in seeing. Very  expensive but all of Singapore is expensive.,5
"I’m very satisfied about hotel’s service, many shopping & delicious food. I will be back as soon as possible. Room is nice view, we spent amazing trip & romatic in my birthday. Hotel staff is so nice when they support or instruction us anything.",5
"We stayed a couple of days as a stopover on the way home.  Impressive Hotel and even more impressive view from the famous pool.  However as impressive as it was it was very impersonal, I think that it is so large it looses its appeal of feeling like you are on holidays...its like a theme park.  The service and staff are excellent and are very helpful, and nothing was too much trouble...In saying that if you are checking out they will store your bags securely not a problem, but have no where to relax in the hotel, while waiting for transport..That is the only downside...The pool is amazing and can be very crowded at times, but that is what you expect it is Instragram heaven!!!",4
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sand for 1 night, the room was nice and spacious. Everything in general reached our expectation during the stay including the staffs and hotel facilities. One thing is on the night we stayed it was during weekend so the pool was busy and crowded  they opened the entrance for outside guests to pay and come up to enjoy the pool which is a bit  too busy for hotel guests who want privacy during their stay ",4
"This is a great hotel. Great rooms, exceptional staff and the pool is incredible. It was my third stay here and it delivers every time. During the short wait to check in, staff were offering us and our children free icecreams and drinks.",5
"My family and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights on a stop over on our way to Europe and we absolutely LOVED it!  We stayed in a family room which was very spacious and so comfortable.  No detail was spared in the room itself and the beds were extremely comfortable which is very important to us after a long flight...Then there's the pool!!  The view from the iconic pool and spa's is breathtaking and the bar and restaurants on that level, offer you options while you admire the best view in Singapore. We will go again; it's only a matter of time.",5
"As a family holidaying in Asia we debated whether it was worth spending the extra cash to stay at this hotel and on balance decided to do so.  It was totally worth it and exceeded all expectations.  The service was splendid, the staff super friendly and helpful and we all enjoyed it.  My daughter especially enjoyed the pool and the pool side service.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is a brilliant hotel to stay in! Yes it can be expensive, so maybe only stay a few nights. You get access to the Infinity Pool on the rooftop which has some great views of the city. Go to the pool when it gets dark and you see the city light up! Even has a metro station connected to it and is just round the corner from Gardens Of The Bay (a must visit if you don’t know about it).",5
"This is an amazing hotel fantastic views, the best infinity pool I've ever seen.The staff were so friendly and helpful it was a real treat to stay here. The only downside is that the sun beds get pretty busy and some people were putting their towels on many beds and then not even using them they spent all their time in the pool and then dried off and left (bizarre). This really needs managing as we really struggled to get a bed. It got really busy at the weekend but during the week its was lovely .",5
We were so excited about coming here ...went to sky bar only option for vegetarians were in their words chips and spinach leafs !! Nothing else left on menu other then beef burgers  Had to wait for what seemed like a eternity for drinks to be brought to our table  Oh and ran out of coffee !,1
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night for my wife's 30th birthday and it absolutely exceeded all expectations. This was mainly due to the exceptional service we received from Cindy Go, and her colleague Kateline See. They went above and beyond any level of service we hoped for and helped create an unforgettable experience. The rest of the staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly too - from check in to the pool staff.  The hotel itself is spectacular and really is a must do if visiting Singapore. The infinity pool experience alone is worth visiting for.  This is the best hotel we have ever stayed in, not least because of the level of customer service - as well of course for the amazing location and endless amenities.  A true 5 star experience.",5
I think most people probally only stay one night and go for the pool.  The pool is amazing and best visited in day and at night.  The rooms are ok with some nice touches but have had nicer rooms for a lot less money!  The lifts are a nightmare!  It took us 20 minutes to get a lift from 6thfloor to reception to check out ! They are very slow and always full.  Breakfast buffet great with everything you could wish for.,5
"Visited here on our honeymoon and managed to persuade my new wife to part with the money to stay here for one night & it was certainly worth it. We were very early for check-in and was hoping to just leave our bags there whilst we ventured out, but so we could check in on arrival they upgraded our room. We stayed on the 45th floor and the views of the gardens were incredible. It's very much like a Vegas hotel, absolutely huge with restaurants, shopping and even gondolas. The pool was everything I had hoped it would be. Stunning back drop of the city. Room was huge, bathroom was amazing. One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in!",5
"Although we did enjoy this hotel it was rather impersonal and expensive. We were there last week and enjoyed our time, but we were the oldest couple that we saw in this very big hotel. We are in our sixties and found most of the occupants were in their 30s and seemed to not flinch when they used their credit cards or any cards. We were a cash minority. At least we can say we have been there and it was amazing, but once is enough. The shopping in this area is all high end.",3
"This hotel exceeded all of my expectations.  I picked it for the amazing pool and architecture and I'm so glad I did.  Our room was on the 40th floor with a city view.  The room was comfortable, quiet, and had all that one would expect.  And those views... The pool was just as amazing as I'd hoped.  It's a tourist destination itself.  I'm so glad my first visit to this amazing city included the Marina Bay Sands!",5
"Very remarkable stay with stunning view both from the room and infinity pool.  We stay at 39/F and It is very impressive that the housekeep specialist Ms. Zhu Mei managed to keep a very tidy clean up everyday we requested for a room make up service. What's more, the cute animals made by towels are super cute! We love it very much and thanks for the smiley face she welcomes us.  A warm stay and very convenient to go to any other visiting spots in town. ",5
"We spent the first few days of our honeymoon there. We got an upgrade to the 31st floor and got our room early upon arriving. The room was spacious and beautiful. We had a gorgeous view of the water and the botanical garden. The poo, was the main reason we chose the hotel. However, it wasn't all we had hoped. Very crowded and floors were slippery. It was still a sight to see. The shopping plaza was fantastic with every upscale retailer you can think of. Loved our stay and will come back again",5
"rude staff in the pool . amazing checking with Maria . we celebrate our anniversary , Maria took care of everything nice hotel  , nice suit room ,amazing view . the dinner in the international buffet was amazing .",3
"Stayed for a night. The room was spacious and comfortable. The viewing deck was good and so was the infinity pool before it got really crowded. What lets this hotel down is the overall service by staff. Aside from the housekeeping staff, the service felt really impersonal. Just doing the basics such as greeting guests and smiling seem to be too much work for some. We even witnessed a staff member at the breakfast buffet yell at a guest who couldn't understand what she was saying (language barrier).   Such a shame because otherwise, the location is excellent. ",2
"I stayed one night at MBS because it was the thing to do as a tourist visiting Singapore. Overall, it was an okay stay but I'd recommend for those looking to stay here only try it for a night for the ""experience"" but switch to another hotel  thereafter for the rest of your trip. Firstly, it's a very pricey joint and at S$499++ the room did provide a nice view of Gardens by the Bay. The Infinity Pool up on the rooftop was also a wow. But that's where the positives stop. The buffet breakfast up on the rooftop was a total ripoff. At nearly S$53 pp, the quality of the food wasn't the best - I've had much more memorable ones in other major hotels. The thing I can't get over is the appalling customer service. One wait staff was literally yelling at a non-speaking English guest for her…",2
"We didn't stay at this hotel, but non guests are able to go to the cheese and chocolate buffet at Club 55- which we did. The buffet was amazing, there was a large selection of cheese and bread plus accompaniments, and an even larger selection of chocolates and desserts. We recommend not eating much before coming here as there is so much to sample! As if the buffet wasn't good enough already, the views from floor 55 of the Marina Bay Sands are outstanding. Service was very good and there was a pleasant atmosphere (entry is by reservation only, so it should never be too busy). On a Tuesday there are half price cocktails which we enjoyed. At $48 per person (including unlimited tea and coffee) we thought the buffet was very good value and a great experience.",5
"Access to the rooftop infinity pool was the main reason we booked this hotel and although it's pricey I thought it was worth it. We got an early check in so had use of the pool for the whole day which was great. Staff are excellent throughout the hotel, very friendly and helpful. The hotel is crazy busy but somehow they manage to have a seamless and efficent check in and check out process! Hotel itself is huge and attached to a big shopping mall...so big sometimes you lose your way getting around. We booked a city view room which had a great view. The room itself was nicely decorated and large, but to be honest it didn't blow me away. As I mentioned already the main draw is the pool...which was fab and had fantastic views of the city...as we got an early check in we used it all…",4
"The hotel itself looks amazing but inside the lobby is a bit disappointing as it is just a standard lobby with lots of people, check in can take a while but you get free drinks and ice-cream so can't complain. No sight of the lots of restaurants and attractions it says it has 'in the hotel' However, all this is around the hotel, shopping mall, museums etc. There is lots to do! Given the price per night, we stayed for one night with the intention to be at the pool all day, and it didn't disappoint. We arrived at midday and throughout the day it was really quiet and picked up at 4pm onwards, we stayed until 9pm. The food was amazing, the view was the best, there were fighter jets, parachutes, machine guns, tanks, all in one day! Sunday is the best day to be there as they have the…",5
"What a hotel, 15 minutes, only one traffic light, away from Changi, this Singapore landmark. Had a harbour view room, means you look at botanical gardens, not to the city. Nothing to complain about the room, spaciaous, good shower, large tv, large bed, good internet, 2 free water a day.  The pool is obviously the place to go, next to ce la vie restaurant. The latter, very expensive, but hey, this is the 57th floor. Pool open from 6, and crowded from 6, lol. Views breathtaking.  Breakfast at rooftop too, always a queue, not so well organized, also very low table only, cosy, but not so convenient. Large selection of food, western, indian, asian, you got it. 52 sing a steep price.   Also check in and check out, queues all the time, and concierge service to get your bags, take them…",4
I stayed there for 8 days and everything was perfect.   Plenty of restaurants with my favourite being Bread (Gordon Ramsay restaurant) buy many other good ones.  The room had spectacular views and it had everything you could want. The gym was great too and working out with that view was amazing.  Top marks.,5
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights on our honeymoon. It is an incredible hotel - absolutely huge and it has many luxurious facilities.  I would absolutely recommend it for the experience of the view and the pool. The pool is breathtaking and the view is incredible. The breakfast buffets are unbelievable and everyone will find something they enjoy. The buffet on the roof near the pool is the best.   Other than the experience, you are a very small fish is a very large pond. We waited 2 hours for our luggage to be brought from the concierge to our room because they were busy and had to get to the rooftop pool at 6am for a sun lounger. It does feel crowded and they do capitalise on the experience. Someone from the hotel took photos of us in the pool which we could…",4
"I loved my gorgeous room overlooking gardens by the bay and the ocean, such a treat to view this part of Singapore, beautiful day and night. I was however more disappointed by the Swimming pool : of course it is (maybe) the most famous landmark of Singapore, however it’s a bummer when you are a swimmer and want to do your lapse early morning and it’s still filled with Chinese tourists that have basically no respect, and just want to take pictures pictures pictures. Hence my so so rating: i feel it’s pitiful you can’t really enjoy the pool that you are certainly paying for, since during the day it’s a tourist invasion, and in the early morning, good for pictures (apparently) ",3
"We have been here twice now, the first time we stayed for a week. We had an incredible room ( not cheap but the view and facilities made the treat worthwhile) . The service was exceptional as was the food.  Of course the Skypark and the pool are the absolute highlights.",5
"If you are into the Disneyland-slash-cruise ship kind of a traveller, then Marina Bay Sands might just be the hotel for you.   It felt so massive, too crowded, too much for me to digest that I wasn't really able to enjoy my stay in the hotel. there were like hundreds of guests queuing at the front desk to check in, it felt like I was going on a cruise ship. It didn't help that we arrived when MAMA (Asian Music Awards) event was happening and the hotel was booked with dozens of asia's pop artist who were staying in one of the (cordoned-off) tower. Long queues at the lobby restaurant for breakfast too. Even swimming at the roofdeck pool felt uncomfortable with too much people.  Nonetheless, I'm glad to have experienced the iconic building in Singapore.",4
"We stayed on the 50th floor overlooking the city. Fantastic views day and night. A king bed and sofa bed was suitable for 2 adults and 2 small children. Lots of amenities and remote control for the curtains. The infinity pool is amazing but very crowded. Great option of adults only and kids pool section. Hard to get a deck chair with so many people. Access keys are provided per person to access the pool area. You guest you can visit the Observation deck for free as a guest. Breakfast is fantastic! Check in and check out was very efficient. Easy access to food court, casino and Gardens by the Bay. Prices are a bit excessive though.",5
I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights with my family. The room was clean and comfortable. We didn't take the all inclusive breakfast we chose to eat instead at the convenient shopping Centre/ mall attached to the hotel (beautiful) with so many choices. The hotel has many beautiful restaurants and exclusive shopping to fulfill every need. It is situated right next to the flower dome and cloud forest next to the super grove tree at the garden by the bay which is worth seeing. What is also AMAZING is the Art & Science museum which will blow your mind. Worth visiting. The exquisite infinity pool is breathtaking but be prepared to share it with all of the hotel guests +/- 3000 guests. Even at 6am there must have been around 100 people there already. Brace yourself for all the crowds…,4
"Marina bay sands is located in the heart of the singapore city and it's a part of all sight seeing trips in the city. It's a big hotel on top of it is the famous skypark. Tourists can get up to the top after taking entry fees. There is a small photo session at the bottom, the memories at the marina bay will be given on reaching the top. High speed lift service is available nayicha will take you to the top where we can experience the awesome scenic beauty of singapore. We can see the city at a glance and can take nice clicks which will make your trip memorable. So never ever miss this.",5
"Nothing to add to hundreds and hundreds of excellent feedbacks already received..  Everything was superlative and the architecture is majestic, unique design.. excellent!  We got a room on the 51st floor, of course the view of the city was incredible. We enjoyed every single detail: the cleanliness, the scent of the room, the comfort of the bed, the softness of the sheets. And what about the pool... definitely amazing! A special thanks to Miss Lydia Kho, who was so friendly and incredibly helpful, we appreciated a lot. We loved to stay there..I truly recommend this hotel!",5
"We had a great time staying at the MBS although just for a night. Despite going for the cheapest room option we got a room on the 38th floor with an amazing city view.  The view is to die for. Arriving at 10 am in the morning we were ready to store our luggage and wait until the usual 3pm check-in time while the loveliest lady at the check-in counter gave us the room straight away without any waiting time (which we were super grateful for after a long flight!). All the staff throughout the visit were helpful. The pool as expected is great, with drinks priced rather normal for Londoners, water warmish, at every time of the afternoon, evening, morning we found free sun beds, as well as free spots for photos at the edge of the pool. Ce la vi Restaurant on top of the hotel has great…",5
"I enjoyed my stay at the MBS. I booked a deluxe twin room and a month before arriving, I emailed to ask for a king bed. They obliged my request. However, when I arrived, they were out of king rooms so they upgraded me, for free, to a premier king room.   I ordered room service and had issues with the room service. Since I waited until check-out to voice those issues, they argued with me and only gave me 100 SGD off of the bill.   Overall, nice hotel. Pool is crowded always but it's a part of the fun. Everything is at the hotel is expensive, as is everything in Singapore.   The elevators are slow to arrive and normally full to capacity.",5
You can really enjoy your stay there and to have the most magnificent view of Singapore at night and at day!!  There is nothing bad to say about the best hotel in Singapore but only one thing that there is nothing special in the room and you have to queue much for breakfast even in low season! ,4
Loved this hotel yes tad expensive but you only live once. The pool and bar on roof are amazing and food was good. Security good key card needed to operate lift and get into pool. Everyone very friendly will definitely stay there again,5
Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore is a remarkable hotel! I would dare say it's probably the largest and certainly most photographed. It has become a famous structure of the Singapore skyline. There are more high end shops and restaurants than I could possibly count. Even if you don't stay here almost everyone will visit the shops and restaurants... it really is amazing!!! A must see!!!,5
"It is an absolute eye wondering experience to be looking from the Infinity Pool on their roof top, shame for the price you pay they do not give you a bottle of bubbles or a welcome gift. Not cheap but  plenty of other places to go & eat at.  The light show from our room of the Gardens was spectacular.",5
"Marina Bay Sans hotel have made our vacation in Singapore so much better!  Great stuff, amazing room with a great view and unforgettable swimming pool! Worth the money , what an a great memory! :) Go for it",5
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands a few days ago whilst stopping over in Singapore, en route to Borneo.   The hotel itself is absolutely mind blowing, the facilities are immaculate and it's obvious that every care is taken to ensure the guests stay.   We made full use of the skypark (ce la vi and the pool)  Dinner at Ce La Vi was lovely, although slightly over priced for the food we had, still lovely but it is expected when dining with the most spectacular vue.   The infinity pool is again amazing but the drinks really let them down, I.e it was $44 (for two mojitos that weren't made from scratch but used a pre made mojito syrup from a bottle ( this is in clear vue of the bar in the fridge)   Our stay was fantastic, the only bad points I would give is that the accommodation does feel…",5
Today I visited both roof top restaurants The Spago and Ce la Vi Skybar as it was my intention to gather some information prior to making a booking.  On both occasions I was ignored whilst the members of staff played with their mobile phones.  When I did manage to get their attention I  was treated in a dismissive manner.  This is not the Customer Service I would have expected from this 'prestigious' hotel.,2
"We spent 3 nights at this magnificent  hotel! It is a megastructure and really impressive building. Anyway you look at it you feel impressed.We stayed on the 43rd floor in tower 2 and chosen the sky view rooms overlooking the gardens by the bay and the sea. The view was great. The rooms had a minimal decoration with all the amenities that we could require.  The room was spotless clean. The hotel has a grest location surrounded by so.many landmarks of Singapote, the gardens by the bay, the flyer, the esplanade and the river front of singapore with the skyscrapers. The best feature of the hotel (among so many) was the infinity pool. It is a 150m long pool on the 57th floor with great views of the city! It is open from early morning till 11pm in the night and it is really worth…",5
"If you are traveling to Singapore, don't miss the Barina Bay pool. Even if you are not a guest, you can just visit it and for sure you'll not regreat any dolar payed for the entrance fee. The view is amazing and you'll feel that you are in touch with the sky.",5
"hotel rooms were very large ( city side ) and very well maintained, rooms had footlighting which is always convenient when waking up in the middle of the night for the bathroom, only let down was the smog which covered the whole city, however not taking away from the hotel as it is unavoidable, distance to nearby shopping centres was uncomfortable due to the humidity and heat at this time of year.",4
"Visited with my 25 year old son for cocktails one Monday night at around 11pm. Thought it may be quiet but it was absolutely buzzing. Very busy, no entrance fee to the night club (probably because it was Monday). Initially we were ushered to the far side of the bar which although busy with fabulous views, this wasn't actually the nightclub. We then found the 'Ce La Vi' at the pool end of the rooftop. Cocktails were around $25 plus service/taxes etc with a DJ and some chilled music. Brilliant views across the city, a must if you are visiting Singapore. I have visited many rooftop bars around the world but this has to be the best I have seen so far for atmosphere, views and general ambience. Highly recommend.",5
"We stayed here for my mums 65th Birthday and were treated like royalty!   So, I live in Malaysia and the rest of my family (Mum, dad, brother and his wife) live in the  UK. For my mums birthday, we decided to stay at MBS and I flew down to meet them in Singapore, they flew direct from the UK.   They were due to arrive at the hotel at around 8.30am and I was hoping to get an early check-in. I decided to get in touch with their head of operations to see if this would be possible.  Long story short, the head of operations arranged for an early check-in for EVERYBODY, they granted us ALL an upgrade to Club which included afternoon tea at 2pm, and cocktails at 5pm.  At check-in we were greeted by the head of Guest Experience, Joseph and head of Premium Services, Joanne... I then…",5
"If you have the chance to go there, I would recommend it. They try to spoil you in every possible way.  Be aware that it costs a lot, but the pool on the top is something to see. Not many hotels have such a view",5
"Had an awesome family bonding while staying at MBS, my parents' 2nd time and my brother and his family's first. Very near to all the other tourist spots I had planned to bring them to-- Flyer, Merlion Park, Gardens by the Bay and of course, MBS Skypark. In between our trips to the attractions, they could just easily go back to their rooms and rest for a while before going to the next stop. Worth mentioning too are the friendly staff. Front desk staff Antonio, took into consideration that we have a toddler with us, so he made sure we could check-in the earliest time possible so that the child will be comfortable. Our boy was just recovering from cough and colds, but he didn't even know that and yet he thought of our baby boy.",5
"It was our second stay in this amazing hotel and everything was perfect! Despite the size of this ""monument"" and the large number of rooms, everything is made to facilitate your stay. As soon as we arrive, the staff is very kind and helpful. We checked in the Club rooms dedicated registration. We had the chance to be upgraded in a junior suite. I was staying with one of my nieces for her 19th birthday and she said she will never forget this stay.  The Club 55 with an unforgettable view of the city and the gardens. Once again, everything is well organized : despite many guests arriving at the same time, you do not have to wait for a long time to be seate and a glass of champagne is served while you re waiting. The world renowned pool is a must see of course and overcrowded but…",5
They sent a guy with 2 sets of ear plugs becos lugs becos that is the way the conf organiser booked the rooms. Worse room ever of any hotel! Seriously they sent ear plugs - come on! Worst exp ever. Bad bad bad,1
Very nice. everything working in the right way. The room are big. The service is ok. The wiew is wonderfull. The swimming pool a dream. go and stay no less than 2 night. The breackfast is ok. Only check in and out are a litle booring. to much to stay in que.,5
"Theres nothing but good things about the hotel. The staff are lovely they really helped in providing us a room with the best view and a late check out.  Oh my god. The infinity pool is insane!! An experience like no other! I dont think a trip to Singapore is made if you haven’t stayed at this amazing hotel. Honestly if you can, you must spend a night for the amazing pool and luxury experience.  From inside the hotel you can access the casino and the premier mall which literally is loaded with luxury based brands and fancy restaurants. I mean the mall even had a lake with a boat ride going through.. it was pretty amazing. ",5
"I recently returned from a six day stay at Marina Bay Sand. The hotel is beautiful and housekeeping up to par, but the staff at the front desk works slowly and hotel staffing needs to increase. We checked in at 1:20 AM. This process took at least 30 minutes which is more time than has ever been needed at any hotel, ever in my life. When charges are 500+ a night, I expect competent support staff.I would suggest finding a hotel at a lower price point.",3
"The hotel was absolutely fabulous, spotlessly clean, architectully spectacular, and the staff really helpful.  Now the bad bits about my experience.  TIp  I arrived by underground  There are two stops at the end of the line one called Bayfront and one called Bay Sands. Who'd have thought the stop called Bay Sands isn't actually The Bays Sands Hotel stop but is actually half a mile walk away. You actually need the Bayfront stop which the hotel sits on (der).  Now this is my real disappoint. I booked this hotel in April having seen it on TV and always wanted to see the F1 night race in Singapore(which is in September) so thought lets go for it. I rang the hotel and asked before I booked what the best rooms for viewing the Grand Prix were. I was told to make sure you book a deluxe…",3
"When I knew I was going to Singapore I knew I had to swim in this absolutely great and record breaking infinity pool on Marina Bay Sand's rooftop. It's was not a big surprise that the pool was pretty crowded and in the evening and night it kind of turns into club atmosphere. If you are looking for peace and would like to rest, that's the wrong place. But to enjoy the spectacular view while swimming and just watch the many selfie people, it's good fun. Be aware that they do not have sun umbreallas there and only a few palm trees for shadow. But there's a second terrace facing the sea and there's plenty of trees and shadows.   The thing that convinced me were the early morning hours. If you are there by 6:30 a. m. you will watch an awesome sunrise! You'll be able to catch a sunbed…",4
"Ok, it is a one-of-the-art hotel and you can have access to the Infinity Pool on the roof plus we had a beautiful view over the Marina Bay Gardens and the room itself is really spacious so what could I possibly not like about it? I'm not talking about the prices because I understand, demand is high. High demand also means it's crowded - always. No way you can just go down and address the lobby - there's always a waiting line. And one more thing - unless you leave the hotel by car, bu subway or via the shopping mall the way out is really problematic - as if it was not considered that a person can leave the hotel NOT via skybridges or any other fancy ways they have and just want to have a walk. But anyway. Do you want a picture in the Infinity Pool? Book a night here. Case closed.",4
"We spent 3 nights at Marina Bay Sands as part of our honeymoon. We arrived around 8.30am and were really relieved that we were able to check into our room after an overnight flight and zero sleep. We went straight up to the 57th floor, and the views were incredible! We had buffet breakfast (S$95/£52...ouch!) at Spago, which was really good. Getting loungers by the pool can be tricky, but luckily most people don't stay all day, so there is a quick turnover. Be careful not to leave your beds unattended for more than 2 minutes though as they'll be claimed. Our room was large and airy, with a huge bathroom. The lifts are a bit of a nightmare - we were on the 16th floor in Tower 2 - easy enough to get to from lobby (although lifts normally full), but to get to the pool you had to…",4
"Very excellent experience,I had a very wonderful memories in MBS with my friends ❤️ We choose MBS to celebrate her birthday and the rooms was very great and had an great view from 50F  We will must choose MBS in the next time ",5
"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands was an item on my bucket list which I crossed off last night as a birthday treat.  At $667 AUD I could only afford 1 night.  Arrived at approx 3am after overnight flight. Was told via email prior to arrival I could register on arrival for early check in. Lined up to do this to be told I couldn't until 6am, however went and sat in the lounge and had a hot chocolate and fell asleep for an hour, luckily the staff didn't seem to mind! They were very friendly.  At 6am, lined up again and pre registered. Room wasn't ready yet. Freshened up and stored bags and got passes to the pool.  I tell you know, the pool and the view from it is the reason you stay here. It was truly a wow moment!  Had breakfast and a couple of cocktails by pool. $76. Be warned.…",4
"Marina Bay sands is a sculpture , architectural marvel , beautifully crafted , iconic...  Salute to the vision and planning   Worth visit, accompanied with beautiful gardens by the bay...one should visit these marvels for treat to your eyes",5

The room was clean but you expect more for the price...  The hotel is super crowded!! There wasn't enough space at the elevator when they came cause you have to wait along time.......  There are many people in the roof and in the pool.,3
"The view from the top is amazing.  Expect to pay DOUBLE the going rate for mixed drinks and TRIPLE or more for wines on the top deck. The food is as good as you would get in most restaurants and generally unremarkable, expect to pay a 50% premium for restaurant food on the top deck.  If you have low expectations of service you will be happy, it's slow and not at all about the customer experience. Take your photos and go see the real Singapore.  A very large and expensive gimmick.  ",3
I have been to Marina Bay especially for the pool. It's very beautiful and the vue is awesome. But the water is very dirty. The service is good. But there is someting missing in this hotel. No spirit. It's worth the experience at least once but not more.,3
"In my opinion the most amazing thing about this hotel is the pool:) Amazing view from the 57 floor.  The rooms are big , we have stayed at 38th floor , cityview.  The wifi internet is not working properly and taking into account the room rate , is annoying.  The price per night is overpriced for the services included( nothing beside the pool and gym )  Also the food the pool is expensive and not very good.  The bath robes were old and overused and need to be change .  All in all , it's was a nice experience . ",4
"Worth every penny! Wonderful hotel with amazing views, many food options, easy access to the gardens by the bay. And of course the iconic infinity pool on the top! An upgrade to a club room is also really worth doing if possible. Very friendly and helpful staff too.",5
"I went to Singapore last year for a weekend staycation. My significant other has been in Spore few days earlier for business trade show and I joined him in the weekend.  The hotel is huge! Very clean and very busy. Lobby ceiling very tall with huge chandelier hanging in the middle. It really is impressive.   The room is quite spacious with well-appointed and well designed furnishings. Loooove the bathroom, my partner and I don't have to fight for space. Lol.  Never had breakfast at the ground floor, we went to the rooftop for breakfast. It was so good. Expensive, of course!... also enjoyed the must-go-for-the-sake-of-social-media rooftop pool which only accessible for the inhouse guests.   Staffs are very effective. The only thing missing? The lack of personalized service. It is…",4
"We arrived a little after 10 and my teenagers couldn't wait to get in the pool. Although there was nobody in front of me for check-in, all 5 of the clerks were busy and I waited for more than 10 minutes. Check-in was pretty slow for such a modern hotel but the girl did her best and went as quickly as possible knowing that we were chomping at the bit to visit the pool. It took about 30 minutes from arriving at the hotel to getting our room keys.   We went straight up to the pool and it looked fantastic in the dark, even though it was very busy. We loved it - and took many selfies at the edge of the infinity pool with the Singapore skyline in the background.   We were on the 10th floor of Tower 3 which didn't sound very impressive, but what a view. We looked straight out onto…",5
"I recently spent 5 nights at MBS during the F1 Grand Prix and I found it an amazing place to visit. The structure itself is an amazing piece of architecture. The infinity pool looking over the city is also a must to be experienced. Was a busy weekend but we found a lounge chair each time we visited the pool area. We had a garden view room which at first may seem like a let down but the way the gardens are lit up at night is also a great view. City view room would have been preferred but gardens are great too. The staff could not have been any more helpful from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Room was in excellent condition, clean and comfortable. It is in no way a cheap investment but at least it's well worth it. ",5
The shopping centre is clean and full of expensive shops! The bay itself is lovely with views! I highly recommend anyone in the area doing the observation deck views! Stunning and memorable views of Singapore. The photos however which they take upon entrance are very overpriced! $65 for two pictures! ,5
"Room is decent and big. Tried deluxe room. Facing to MBS exhibition lower floor. Room TV entertainment a bit confusing to access TV channel. It was so busy and too many people in the lobby and the skypool. Nice to have breakfast by the skypool but you have to queue. The restaurant opened for breakfast starts on 7.00 am. You have to be there at least 10 mins before open. I finished my meal by 7.40 am and when I get out, it was quite long queue for other to enjoy the breakfast by the skypool. Meal was just fine, nothing special. ",3
"Stay for one night at this hotel is one part of my dreams. It's come true on KL - SIN Trip 4 - 8 September 2017 Nothing to say about this hotel, can't describe in words. Amazing and sensational experience. Only one think that the breakfast place should walk very far from the room building",5
"We stayed at MBS in Singapore while visiting the city for the F1 GP. At last minute, decided to cancel the hotel we were staying at and picked up MBS. Check in was prompt and service was excellent. The room was a City View room and is very large and spacious. The best thing about the property is the infinity pool at the top. Great view from there of the city and the GP circuit. Also its close proximity to other parts of Singapore. Loved the stay.",5
"I kept think it's going to be like another 5 star hotel but the view from the top is amazing, the infinity pool is amazing.    The staff are so helpful, I which I stayed here longer now.    The casino was great, having been to Vegas it comes very close to it. ",5
"You could run out of superlatives describing this place. It is an incredible feat of architectural engineering and a vast enterprise. Suprprisingly they pull it off very well indeed. We stayed in a club room and chose the city view. This afforded a brilliant vista of Singapore overlooking the water. The room was spacious and beautifully appointed with an excellent bathroom. As part of the deal we had access to the Club lounge which is excellent. Situated on floor 55 the views are amazing and we enjoyed breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails there. Obviously everyone wants to visit the Skypark and it is quite something to behold. Surprise surprise it is a little crowded but we had no problems finding sun beds and enjoyed our time in the pool together with lots of ither…",5
"Stayed for a day at this iconic property in August 2017 Room were neat, clean and had an awesome view  Breakfast spread was very good.  Lot of activities to choose from  The Infinity pool lived up to it's hype. Awesome views Has a good access to bay side attractions from this property    The overall decor of the lifts can be improved The billing and accounts team were very responsive and were kind enough to reimburse a wrong debit",4
"Me and my family really like this place. Specially the Marina Bay Hotel view, Evening dancing water. And view from marina bay hotel. Also their laser show from top of hotel and the water font. We also found enjoy all brand shop there and shopping. Dont miss the place if you go Singapore.",5
"This hotel is huge! Absolutely massive! I would have rated this 3 stars if it weren't for that staggering view from the top! The pool at the top is good but because the hotel is so big it's really crowded! The also have an ""adult area"" of the pool which is just as crowded but the look out is amazing! We couldn't eat at any of the restaurants at the top because of there no kids policy so we opted for room service as we had a nice view from our room. Breakfast was also really good and in a massive scale pulled of with amazing service but to be honest the hotel itself is a bit lacking in something and felt a bit try hard! It's selling point is the pool but it tries to put across a luxury exclusive vibe which just doesn't fit! ",4
"Reputation proceeds this hotel and everybody knows of its amazing breathtaking view from the rooftop pool. On the downside, it was chaos up there. Children splashing water everywhere, diving into the pool from the sides disturbing everybody, and the worst of it all, there were dressed people inside the pool. Meaning T-shirts or even denim shorts everywhere. Definitely not what we expected when we booked this famous hotel for our honeymoon. We took some great photos from the swimming pool, saw a bit of sunset, and then left for a walk. It was not pleasant to sit and relax there.",4
"We have had an amazing time at MBS, there is nothing you can fault about this hotel and its staff. The customer service is top notch! This is now our second stay and we never hesitate to return, with this hotel being the only hotel we will stay in in the area. Wangelin Sum went above and beyond for us to ensure our stay was perfect!   Can't recommend this hotel enough! ",5
As someone who has never been to Singapore before I decided to spend a few nights at this famous hotel. It did not disappoint. Pricey but well worth it in my view for any first timers in particular. City view room was spectacular and we received a complimentary upgrade. The infinity pool was perfect to spend the day looking at the city skyline. Highly recommended. ,5
"This hotel is simply amazing... enjoy this hotel is something that everyone should do at least once in that life.  It is not just the infinity pool (which is incredible) but it is about the facility, the views, the staff and so on.  Placed just in front of the downtown we can enjoy an amazing view from the hotel.  This is a must if you visit Singapore.",5
"We booked a city sky view room for the last 3 nights of our stay in Singapore - what an awesome way to finish our holiday!  Check in was a breeze but I think we must have timed it well as there looked to be a queue at times when we went through the reception area. Check out was even easier with someone meeting us at the bottom of the lifts, taking our key cards and organising for our bags to be stored.  The room we got was on the 44th floor of tower 1 and had an amazing view with huge bathroom. Within the bathroom itself was a separate toilet, separate shower and a free standing bath and double basins.   The lifts were very quick for the number of people using them and the number of floors that they travelled (our previous hotel lifts were slow in comparison).   The view from…",5
"Stayed for one night this week, leading up to the 2017 Singapore Grand Prix. It's a jaw dropping place from start to finish. Booked a deluxe king room on the bay side for stunning views over the Marina. Checked in really quickly to room 3505.  The infinity pool is not to be missed on the 57 floor. Busy but worth be patient for a sun bed where you can relax and be waited on by very attentive staff. He views are outstanding.  Dressed up for dinner as booked a table at Ce la vi where the food is stunning.  If you like shopping, you are within walking distance of a beautiful high end designer shopping mall.  The gardens by the bay the other side of the hotel a amazing and worth a stroll around after breakfast.  Make sure you save your pennies you'll need them but wow worth every…",5
"MBS is impressive. The excellent service (from front of house, housekeeping, room service and even maintenance). We couldn't fault them. We had a spectacular suite on the 46th floor with views to both the Bay and to the Gardens by the Bay. The restaurants, shops and activities were all right there. So impressive. We would definitely go back",5
"To the Senior Management of Marina Bay Sands,  We would like to feedback on our disappointment in the recent terrible Suite stay at Marina Bay Sands on 15 Jul 2017.  We booked an Orchid Suite (#5227) as it was planned to be a joyous celebration for my young girl's birthday, thinking that the Suite will provide us with the comfort and the upgraded amenities. However, it turned out to be a disastrous stay for my family as summarised in the following incidents.  1) The tap at the bathtub was seriously spolit. Refer to attached pictures. You may wish to check on the log and incident report (if any) to justify our claim.   - When I'm bathing my son (aged 3) in the bathtub using the hand spray, the entire tap suddenly came loose and 'flew out' with high pressure which caused the water…",1
A 3* hotel masquerading as a 5* hotel. 40 minutes to check in and an average wait for an elevator was 30 minutes. The staff hid from us as they knew complaints were thick and fast. If you do opt to stay please stay on a higher floor as you will find it easier to get down to ground level. The hotel is so big they don't know how to manage it. Sorry you have been warned.,1
"If you stay anywhere else in Singapore you will spend your entire trip looking at this hotel wondering what it's like up there!!  It's stunning ..... pay the money & go!   Ask for a high room, the higher the better (just like NCY). Skyview rooms are huge with a free standing bath & shower room. The food/drinks options are pricey but special if you use them. The designer shopping centre is worth a visit & Singapore city is a fusion of cultures. You will get great service & friendly greetings whatever your budget.   We were in Tower 1, city side, Skyview Junior Suite, 42nd floor. Huge beds, cruise style room service, Roberto Cavalli toiletries, rose petals on the bed, etc. Super clean, great mini bar & plasma TV + sofa area. Plenty of restaurants for breakfast, posh lunch or…",5
The Marine Bay Sands is the latest attraction in Singapore with the development of Marine Bay and the Garden by the Bay.   The hotel is massive with 3 different towers all linked together by a roof top pool and garden and restaurants. Visitors have to pay S$20 to visit the observatory deck which only occupied a small area in one end of this top deck and it's not really worth the money.   The hotel has a big casino and the usual range of designer shops.,4
"Visited the Skylark during the 2017 GP and had the 'F1 Lunch'. Not cheap but the food and service was first class, with the most amazing views. Initially 20SD to gain access to the Skylark, this is subtracted from the bill - don't be put off as it is well worth it, a must see experience",5
"Orchid suite, with Club 55 access, so not your standard package, but honestly cannot fault anything. These suite rooms or at least mine have a bathroom with full window view of Singapore harbour and Garden on the Bay. Of course you can close the blind, but 47 floors up, who is looking (and do you care).   Pool is as spectacular as everyone says, but usually very criwded. We went when a storm was rolling in, mid-morning. Almost no-one there, and the infinity views plus the dementia like storm clouds rolling above were totally unforgettable. Obvious chlorine smell, but understandable  given the number of bodies.   I criticise when warranted; I am not a pollyanna. But this experience, including size of suite and almost instant and accurate room requests, were exactly as advertised…",5
"I recently had a chance to stay at MBS, Singapore because the conference I was attending is in the expo there. When I got to the hotel, I was confused. I was looking for a lobby with a check in desk and it wasn't obvious. There were shoppers all over the place. I was told ""this"" is the lobby, as in the entire first floor. There were shops, and a other registration desk for Ce La Vie. I found the registration desk for  hotel further in on the left (when entering through Tower 3). I should have been more specific and asked for the hotel registration desk instead of the lobby.  I asked for a sea view room per friend's recommendation and I got my wish answered with a corner room on the 7th floor. The view was spectacular. The ""balcony"" faced Gardens by the Bay and so every night I…",3
Everyone who is visiting singapore must stay and visit marina bay sands hotel. If stay is not affordable to everyone one should visit its sky park. Best view availabe in singapore from marina bay sky park.,5
Having read the reviews I had a few concerns about the size of the hotel and level of service I would get but you have to stay here for at least one night when you come to Singapore don't you?  I had no need to worry at all.    We booked a Club City View Room and from the moment we booked the service was exceptional.  The pre arrival form is a great idea and we were told to go directly to the Sands Lounge for check in. We arrived tired from our flight from the UK at 8am and were sat down with a drink and checked in straight away and our room was ready for us.  All great.  The room was beautiful on the 42 floor with fantastic views.  Everything was spotlessly clean as you would expect.    We went up to the pool for a refreshing swim and a light breakfast on the loungers (of which…,5
"My husband and I stayed here for one night in their 'Grand Club Room' and it was AMAZING!!!! The room was tidy, clean, had the perfect amenities for it.  It was our Honeymoon/1st Anniversary treat to ourselves and I couldn't have asked for more better memories and enjoyments. The view from the room was STUNNING!!! It was ceiling to floor window that literally viewed the WHOLE marina bay. The bathroom had a bathtub nicely situated next to the window where I got to enjoy a lovely bath and enjoy the night lights of the gardens of the bay Avatars and the just the small city view/ocean view as well. That will be my most memorable moment, that and also the amazing view from our room. The check in area I found was EXTREMELY BUSY!!! It looked like a busy airport check in area, luckily…",5
Fantastic experience.  We only stayed one night but would very happily spend a week.  It is expensive but you get a wonderful experience.  The room was vast with a huge bathroom with bath and shower.  Small balcony.  We were 40 floors up so what a view.  The rooftop bar and infinity pool are absolutely amazing.  It is so relaxing to lie by the pool and look across the city or to stand at the pool edge.  A unique and beautiful place. ,5
"We book a Club room over looking the city.The room exceeded our expectation with amazing views over the city. As we had the Club 55 package and so many things to pack in during our short stay we didn't have time to enjoy the room.  We arrived at 12 M.D and were checked in after a short wait in tower 1.We were given an access key for the swimming pool and our suitcases were stored in the baggage room.Reception said we would be informed by email, when the room was ready.  So off we went to the pool which is obviously amazing, fantastic and an incredible experience. At 12 M.D there were plenty of sun beds and attentive bar staff. Pool towels were available.There was three sections of the pool, one for adults only which they were very strict about.There was other available seating…",5
"Rooftop view of the city cannot be beaten by any other rooftop in the city! So much cheaper compared to US or European rooftop, the infinity pool is just the icing on that beautiful cake! Got to be seen by everyone at least once in a lifetime.",5
"Huge property with plenty of foodies favorite eatery.  But you need to endure the walk as the shopping mall is elongated and restaurants are placed in diverse directions.  If you are a hyatt or Starwood regular, you might be disappointed with the room in terms of amenities, bathroom and bedding. Above all, it is good choice if accessibility tops your considerations.",3
"Spacy, excellent rooms. Good service. Hotel is pretty unpractical. Depending on which floor you stay, it may take three elevators to get on top. Card must be always in hand to get in anywhere. Place is bit like a labyrinth.  Wonderful restaurants, magnificient infinity pool, great views, free access to sky park. Goos location, lot to see around.",4
I was here with my family. My two girls couldn't get enough of the pool and the sun.   We were facing the river and the view is simply breath taking. We are definitely coming back here for our family trip.,5
This place is so huge and which makes it almost unmanageable. The check in took us over an hour. There is no lobby in an alleged 5 star hotel !! Ridiculous. The infinity pool is over hyped! It takes atleast 15 mins to reach there in peak hours. There is no shower area or maybe the staff isn't aware if there is one !!  The views are great. The breakfast waiting is another nightmare. I don't want to wait for 20 mins in a queue ...Its really too much time when you have come for work. I would definitely not revisit. There are better 5 star hotels. I would prefer Hotels with better service and ease in getting things done. Again though my breakfast was included in the hotel every time it would show up as not included. After 20 mins waiting and another 10  mins everytime for them to…,3
"All the hotel is a unique experience. The check - in is not so quick because too many clients check in at the same time. The room was perfect, with stunning view to the city. But what makes this hotel different is the pool. We were lucky that it was not so crowded. Great experience, breathtaking view, you can't get out of the water, we stayed inside the pool for more than 5 hours!! The pool bar and all the stuff were very well organised and the food was of high quality. The gym was among the best I have ever visited. The breakfast was rich, never ending, tasteful with hundreds of choices. Can't wait for the next time to visit this hotel.",5
"I attended the Customer Experience Summit Asia held on Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre. The Event Hall had a good ambience with proper temperature, lighting and sound. The staff at the event were helpful. Food served at the event was great. The event area, the breakout rooms and other places such as the rest rooms were well kept and neat. ",4
"On my bucket list and I wasn't disappointed!  3 Towers and we were in Tower 3 and we had a room high up and the views from the room were insane.   Doesn't matter where you are, you can see it from all over Singapore.   The rooftop pool is the best part of this hotel. The views are brilliant and especially at night.   Just be aware that everywhere you go it's plus plus! The vat and tax 17% added on top of your bill   There's so much to do and Hawkers market and satay street are a must. Also Raffles, sky garden and the Domes ",5
"This place is stunning whether your sat in a restaurant or bar taking in the breathtaking views of this place, at the top of it or shopping inside it, it is the best part of Singapore. We went to Singapore when the festival was on so got the amazing experience of watching the laser show and fireworks. We went to the top of it and the views are unreal!  Inside is a shoppers paradise!!! Wow, the best shopping centre I've ever been to. From high street shops to designer shops, cafes and restaurants, this place has it all. It even has a man made river running through it where you can take a boat ride through from one side to the other. You must visit marina bay sands whilst visiting Singapore!",5
The service was excellent from the point of booking the hotel online things were very much easy. the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and even upgraded us complimentary to a suite. There's so much to do in the hotel and so much entertainment options are there for free and for a fee. Really wished we had more time to explore. The pool was amazing but much more crowded than anticipated probably because it was a Saturday. Would love to visit again. once again the service is exceptional.,5
Stayed one night here after long flight from U.K. Loved it. Check in was very quick and easy and we were very impressed that our room was ready even though we arrived rather early. The roof top pool was fantastic. We spent a great afternoon there. The hotel was in a lovely location very close to the gardens. Would highly recommend this hotel,5
"We were picked up by hotel limousine, Ms. Kateline welcomed us upon arrival at the hotel, we were able to check-in at the hotel around 10am which was great news since we had an early flight. We tried to swim at he hotel around 10pm but there were plenty of people so we just decided to walk around. Ms. Kateline provided us with a birthday cake as well, thank you!",4
I felt the hotel was rather disjointed and it took me two days before I found a restaurant that I felt comfortable in.  The casino was geared to Oriental not Occidental customers so not to my liking.  Think a few more European type games would be good.,4
"This hotel is a little Las Vegas In South East Asia. But better for the top sky pool   gambling arena must show your passport, closed to MRT . running around Singapore  marina. This place has best location for every occasion you have in Singapore.   Specially when there is a show at Esplanade.",4
"We stayed in a Maina suite with a pool table which overlooked the Gardens by the Bay. The view was truly stunning! The suite had everything we needed and you felt you could quickly escape the hustle and bustle of the main lobby. The butler service was very efficient and well organised. Unfortunately Club55 really let it down, it was more like mass produced dining than a place to relax for a drink or breakfast. The breakfast in Spago was even worse. As soon as you stepped away from your suite you lost any personal service.  The pool has great views and is fun if your willing to deal with crowds and noise. It was a fun place.",3
"Everything about the hotel is spectacular: the arquitechture, the location, the shopping mall, the convention center, the service. I spent only a couple of days but I sure made the right decision. I would recommend it anytime!",5
Stayed here for two nights while visiting Singapore en route to Bali. Lovely hotel in a great location. Absolutely massive and for that reason I would say it feels like more of a business hotel that anything else. Albeit a rather luxurious one. The room we had was a harbour view room that gave excellent views. The room was massive and immaculate. Very comfortable it has to be said. The pool is quite special. Very crowded first thing and at night but late morning it was dead when we were there. Went to Cé La Vi for drinks one night and was a bit disappointed however. It was full of fee paying travellers with personal hygiene issues hogging tables and not even buying drinks. We moved on to Spago which doesn't have the same views (as easily) but was significantly less crowded and…,4
"The hotel itself is very nice, we had a great experience at check in and throughout our stay, however, I typically prefer smaller hotels with more personable service. What makes this hotel very desirable is the iconic building and the rooftop pool. The pool did not disappoint! Amazing views!!! I've never seen such a big pool in my life. Definitely worth staying here.",4
"So, myself and partner stayed here very recently for two nights, from 07/09/17 to 09/09/17 for a little bit of luxury at the end of our Singapore holiday. And when you walk into this place, it really is WOW! Just WOW! Stunning architecture, you would expect so for the apparent 8 billion it cost to build. However, the lobby area is HUGE and VERY busy, as its open to the public there are a lot of wonderers, locals, tourists, just walking through along with the reels of staff and hotel guests, so it is quite overwhelming, also, checking in, we were queuing for about 15 minutes, there are I believe two check in desks and both queues were long, not really what'd expect from paying as much as you pay to stay here. And because the lobby is so big, if you're at the wrong end for…",4
Stayed at this hotel for 1 night as part of a trip exploring Southeast Asia with my fiancee and brother.  The hotel has three towers and all have their seperate checkin/checkout desks. The hotel is enormous! Took us a while to find the right area to checkin. After this we did however manage to get an early checkin at 1pm.  We booked 2 deluxe sky view rooms overlooking the city - one on the 45th floor and one on the 47th floor of the 3rd tower.  The rooms are large. We had a living area as well as the bed area and plenty of space in between our room. Bathroom was beautiful also.   The reason everyone stays here is obviously for the infinity pool located on the top floor which only hotel guests can access with individual key cards to gain entry.   The views were absolutely…,3
"If you don't like to be greeted and pampered by people with fake smiles regulary, this is the place to be. A nice lady at the reception, before closing her counter was kind enough to upgraded our rooms from (terminal 3) 21st floor to a club room in (terminal 2) 44th floor. Never saw her again.   The Infinity pool is an unique experience, lovely and stunning views. Great Breakfast Buffet (Spago).......   If your fine with man-made nature and scenery then explore the building and it surroundings.  Overall it is an experience you can do whilst in Singapore, and to be added to your bucket list but I wouldn't return.",5
We visited as part of a night tour and it was certainly an interesting place to visit. Very crowded but our tour guide got us through most of the crowd resonably quickly. Great views from the top deck. Lots of high end shops around the lower level as well as the Casino.,4
"The room I stayed in on the 40 something level was average, nothing spectacular and I wouldn't stay there again in a hurry for the amount of money it costs but if you have to stay just one or two nights for the rooftop pool experience, then do because it's amazing. Fabulous buffet breakfast, cocktails by the pool, it's a once in a lifetime experience.",5
"We stayed for one night, on a stopover, and were impressed with the friendly and excellent service. We arrived early morning and put our bags into the storage area and explore the city. We arrived back for check in later in the day and were well received and shown to an excellent room - the views were amazing. The infinity pool was a highlight and we spent the afternoon on the roof top pool, relaxing and drinking. Great spot for a short stay!",4
"Yes it's worth it, standing in line for check-in, and the pool is too crowded in the afternoon. But without staying here it would not be the real experience of Singapore. It's really iconic. The room was better than we expected, impeccable clean with towel elephant welcoming us. We booked a r city view room , 47th floor, perfect view. Check out was smoothly, you just leave your hotel cards in an envelope in the box in lobby instead of waiting. Impressive hotel, a must to do once in a lifetime. Don't forget to redeem your points , just fill the MBS card, and you can spend them after in most of the shops and restaurants. It's worth it.",5
Having had the chance to visit Singapore for 3 days we wanted to experience the Marina Bay Sands as it is the talking point on the bay with its unique shape. Whilst the external is a brilliant talking point it lacked any prestige internally. It is big but nothing to write home about. We purchased the $20 voucher per person (minimum cost to enter the upstairs outdoor bar area) which is redeemable for either food or drinks in either the bar or restaurant but let me warn you - at $27.72 for 1 Pina Colada it is not cheap. The food is also pricey. Paid $24 for a starter of calamari with no more than 6 tiny pieces. Had to eat at the bar as no tables available till 10.15pm. They take final food orders at 10.45pm so we walked out without eating dinner as it was packed with people…,3
"Well, we just loved the view from our club room.  Truly stunning, the club room, which offers breakfast, afternoon tea and canapés is wonderful and worth the money. However, its rather unpersonal, as it is huge.  The staff are very helpful and friendly, but you can not get away from the hotels size. Its worth a stay, just to say you have stayed in this building!",4
"It's great to go for a tour of the building itself, but I personally wouldn't want to stay at the hotel since it's quite noisy (there are thousands of people in there).   If you're in Singapore, explore the building and surroundings, it's beautiful.",4
"I absolutely loved staying here, I really DID NOT want leave, the service from staff is amazing and the facilities are un comparable, The Infinity pool is breath taking and spent an entire day enjoying the food and drink in the glorious sunshine sitting in the poor over looking Singapore, the view is breath taking. The rooms are luxurious and have everything you will need plus more.",5
"This is an amazing building with the infinity pool a dream but that is pretty much what you are paying for.  The room is nice but apart apart from a couple of bottles of complimentary water nothing else is free from the minibar.  Wi fi was extremely slow considering this is a five star establishment.     Our room faced the Gardens by the Bay however as we were only on 6th floor you do get the noise from the road below.  Where breakfast is included it was great to enjoy this on the rooftop by the pool.  The pool can get crowded depending on time of day, we were there mid afternoon so was not too busy.  There is very little shade so it can get really hot, take sun cream!  Also if you wish to use their pool service for snacks or drinks bring wallet unless you have set up charge to…",4
"Stayed here for 4 days in July in a large club room. The room was so nice with a great view of the city. From the bathroom we could enjoy the bay view. We liked it so much that on our last day we just ordered a great in room dining when enjoying the view and the water show.   We can not say we enjoyed the rest of the hotel that much. But this depends on what you like. If you like it big, this would be nice for you. We do not like it this big and crowded. Just made us feel living on an airport at once we left our room. It is off course difficult to keep up the standard on the service in a hotel like this. So if you are use to stay in nice hotels, you will probably be disappointed. The staff have to handle so many people that the service is very much like robots. The famous pool…",3
"Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore Designed as an adult theme park , Marina Bay Hotel surprises and inspires every traveller. Famous endless roof pool with panoramic views of shining Singapore. Best location for overseeing skytrees at Garden By The  Bay and water shows , especially during night time, all of the colorful nights shines like another playground By luckily  conneting tunnels underground ,stay in this hotel makes every attractions of shopping mall, subway, restaurant and Casino esily and friendly to access and enjoy.",5
I stayed there for one night and the view of the gardens by the bay was amazing. The pool is great but there's too many people. Don't expect the best customer service as I had communicated about USB chargers and they said the room doesn't have them beforehand. Got to the room and there it was. Emailed them with a photo to prove it and got a phone call late at night when I was almost half asleep and got an apology over the phone. NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN! ,2
"Our stays at MBS have always been enjoyable. The rooms, be it city view or garden view, offer an amazing panoromic view of the landscape. We like the rooms for its cleanliness and spaciousness. Amenities in the room are well catered for too. If there's something about the hotel to be picked on, it would have to be the checking-in queue. It could take quite awhile to be checked in, if you arrive at the 'wrong' hour. Perhaps hotel management could consider introducing internet check-in, just like the airlines, to speed up the process? You can choose to either dine within the hotel, where there are a number of restaurants, catering to different tastes or at the Shoppes, where a good number of celebrity restaurants are located. In need of shopping therapy? It's all there at the…",4
"I spent 2 night at Bay Suite room of hotel, it was amazing view out to the bay, great feeling in the morning early to see out. Everything was clean and quite new. Just the staff abit cool, but wasn't matter with us because I love the room and view so much. It was worth for money. highly recommend",4
"An impressive monument of hotel. As a professional traveller I have not seen such impressive size of hotel – that goes with all the professional logistics necessary. Ideally located in the centre of Singapore city, close by and with a view on so many attractions it is a perfect spot to explore Singapore, especially if you are short of time and need to get around quick. The shopping centre adjacent below does not fall short of any other metropolis in the world. Size and popularity has its downfalls. Everything is crowded; attractions become mass product; service needs to cope with numbers – sometimes it works. Brace yourselves for 20 minutes waiting when asking for baggage service at check out. The major attraction is the rooftop pool with all its restaurants and viewing…",4
"The Location and the Hotel is spectacular and the service  and the rooms are spacious and very much what you would expect for the price.  If you are a person that likes things a bit more intimate, this is not for you.  Going onto the roof and moving from one tower to the other, from one restaurant to another and going through endless gates that you have to check through i felt like i was walking ""the great wall of china"".  The pool is breathtaking in every sense but if you don't put a towel down at 8am(i think thats the time they open) you are not getting a lounge.  The Lobby is the same, masses of people but i have tried it once and that was enough. But if you never experienced it yourself, you always wonder what you missed out on.",5
"We love stayed here, though it was a lil bit crowded but over all everything was nice. The security was very strict,  the food just nice,.. (Need to add more menu according 5stars standard), the service all good,  but the biggest point here is the room,  we all love it,  ...fyi we stayed at the club suite room (one level above deluxe room), it's spacious with 2 big queen bed size,  nice interior design, big bathroom complete with nice quality of amenities,  kiddos love stay here,  and of course love the rooftop pool so much 😊and there is direct access to mrt from inside the hotel... I can understand MBs always very crowded,  well It's a lil bit pricey,  but worthed..  ",4
"we were upgraded at suite 5338. unforgettable! gym, spa, karaoke room huge livingroom. super technologic bathroom with soaps by roberto cavalli  kitchen and office. the best pace in my life!  the view is breathtaking in special for night show. I m agree with other customers the reception is too busy and the queue for breakfast isn t accettable for this top ranking hotel. you need to change it ",5
"Everyone has to go one time just for the view from the infinity pool!  Rooms are very spacious - we were lucky enough to receive an upgrade, the room had an amazing view over the city, good for watching the water and light show in the evening.  Plenty of places to go and eat, drink, shop and wander.  Great location.",5
"Stay at this hotel even if it's purely for the access to the rooftop pool.  I promise you it's worth it. What I (luckily) didn't realise before coming to Singapore was that if you aren't staying at the hotel, you ain't accessing that pool Hun!!  It was so breathtaking that we actually spent a full day by the pool which we hadn't planned to do at all having just come from a week long beach holiday.   The restaurants on the 57th floor (particularly Ce La Vi) were amazing as were the restaurants in the hotels mall.  There's so much to do in Singapore though that I would say definitely go and eat at other restaurants in different hotels around the bay and at sky scrapers that actually have a view of the hotel at night.   Rooms could not be faulted and it's a great touch that you can…",4
"From the moment you arrive this place is large, on a grand scale. Checkin was easy and service was fantastic. The room is as you would expect in a hotel of this price, but not 'amazing'. However the facilities within Marina Bay Sands are sensational. We were advised to get a room in Tower 3 as it's less walking. A few great thing you can do within walking distance and you absolutely have to get in that pool on the roof. It's not always crowded, and if you don't mind a pool filled with selfie sticks then you'll be right at home.",5
"I Have Been in Marina Bay Sands Twice Already I Enjoyed Visiting Marina Bay Sands This is A High End Shopping Mall Full Of Branded Signature Items .. It's A Wide Place Wherin Inside There are Some Coffee Shop and A Restaurant To Eat..There's also A Casino and On The Roof Top Level Theirs A Swimming Pool  And A Bar and Sightseeing Indonesia .Outside Surrounded by Sea and There's A Louivuiton Shop Underneath The Sea Situated , Some Food Establishments as well . Nice To Take Pictures With The Background Of The Sea .",4
"You can't being in Singapore and miss the visit to Marina Bay Sands! All in One: Hotel with more than 1,000 luxury rooms, huge variety of restaurants, shops, casino, theater, museum, convention center, admirable architecture with the largest infinite pool with incredible view, and so much fun! What else can you desire? ",5
"Had an excellent time with my family. Clean, satisfying service, nice staff. Infinity pool was one of my favorites, food was delicious, we really enjoyed our stay and had a quality time with my family.",5
Very impressive building but need to work on the detail and service. Be prepared for long long queues at check in and at some of the breakfast locations. Restaurant ran out of butter at breakfast - hardly 5 star service. Offered a newspaper it never arrived and served soup but no thought as to providing a spoon..... Big hotel big prices but needs to work on the little things. ,3
"My first time in MBS was 5years ago (2012) and I was like completely awed by the building. The free water, snacks in The hallway. Everything was just so complete and exclusive. They had this free shutterfly from The airport. The driver was just so accomodating and we were able to check in early. Booked a de luxe room and we were welcomed with a complete named in a big television screen and it really amazed me. Returning after MBS, no free shuttle, The place is so touristry. Over crowded and The queue on The counter was never the same AS lax as before. I booked two rooms. One a deluxe for The newlyweds and The other is a club room (which is much much different from the first one. ( SEE my photos and i hope if you have The budget, recommend to try this hotel AS they have more…",4
You must have a Singapore sling at the bar at the infinity pool.  It's expensive but worth it!  The service at the resort - especially the food and beverage and hosptiality is over the top.,4
"The hotel and the adjoining shopping center are fantastic.  Great shops and restaurants.  The pool on top of the hotel alone is worth the stay.  It is simply spectacular. Although the hotel is busy, it is not overwhelming.  The hotel is a short subway ride away from Orchard street. Did not go into the casino as we are do gamble.  Highly recommend it.",5
Had a great stay here! The staff was courteous and the room was clean with a gorgeous view of gardens by the bay. The only drawback was that such a big hotel failed to have a kids play area or center which normally hotels around the world have. But we found they had a great art science musuem for the kids nearby! ,4
We were blessed to have two rooms here. One was more basic but that still had a lovely bathroom and the other was a suite which was very large with a beautiful bathroom. Both had lovely views and the suite which had a balcony was on the road side but not a problem for us.   The pool was special as it was high and infinity and it's nice to have space to sit and with good bar service poolside.   The food in the hotel was ok and despite eating there a few times we preferred going out.  It was expensive but then it is different and worth the experience.   My 9 year old still raves about it.,5
"Marina Bay Sands is one of the best Luxurious hotel, infinity pool is just awesome. very courteous staff always ready to help, they have laser show everyday in evening. and casino in the hotel is cherry on the cake.",4
"Singapure is a great place for vocation.Marina Bay Sands is a perfect hotel for make your holiday absolutely romantic for a couples. Everything was on a high level standard: room,food,staff,service and atmosphere.If you are looking to reach all those goals you definitely have to book Marina Bay Sands in Singapure even for a one night.",5
"I went visited Singapore with a friend. I should have done the review earlier but I want to give people my perspective and opinion of staying at the MBS.  Regardless if you're coming with a partner, friend or alone for the experience, Marina Bay Sands is stunning. At the base of it is a shopping mall. It has its own station!! That's saying something in itself. It's huge. The two towers expand quite wide so it's great to know which you're at beforehand (especially if you have a lot of luggage). But I'm sure you'll be amazed with the size alone and the shopping mall part. It's epic!  We only stayed a night and really were hoping for great weather.. And great weather is what we had. Glad we could have such an amazing view.  Initially there were some issues booking it which meant…",4
"Well, where do I begin? It has a record-breaking infinity pool perched on a structure that looks like a boat fell onto 3 tower blocks. It probably also has a record-breaking number of people taking selfies against the Singapore skyline too. The rooms are big with suitably complicated lighting systems. The garden views are other-worldly. There are no platypuses. And it's joined on to a swanky shopping centre, like a pair of shopaholic Siamese twins.   But the whole thing doesn't really work. Everywhere there are queues, whether for lifts or bars or restaurants or lobby services. The three towers are strangely disconnected which results in constant trips in over-crowded lifts up and down to various levels. And everywhere you need a key card. It's all a hassle and hotels like this…",3
"Booked a room at the MBS and was immediately upgraded to an Executive suite. Was very surprised on arrival at Changing Airport as an employee of the airport was waiting for us at the arrival gate, she escorted us through customs to the limousine that MBS had sent to pick us up. On arrival at the hotel, was welcomed like a rockstar and check in was conducted in our suite. The suite was well aired, a swan made with towels and surrounded with rose petals, and a complimentary bottle of champagne. During the all stay, all staff were very nice and welcoming. No effort were spared to make our stay a memorable one ance again. Thank you to all the staff at Club 55, the cleaning lady and most of all to Wangelin.... you are a real jewel in the crown and you will always be present in our…",4
Nobody can miss seeing this hotel because of its  awesome size that commands attention towering over the Singapore skyline and its unique iconic three tower design.   It is also located beside another Singapore tourist icon -- the Garden by the Bay and infront of the famous Merlion Park.  The hotel is accessible via taxi and MRT.  It helps that It has its own MRT station on its basement connecting to the country's vast network of train system. Commuting in and out of the hotel to the city and other tourist sites is very easy although requires a lot of walking.  The hotel's lobby has a intimidating feel because of the  high ceiling and busy mood.  People just keep on pouring in inside the lobby.  The Checkin and Checkout counters for standard room guests can also be bogged down…,5
Most luxurious and by far the best hotel I stayed.  Excellent location and amazing view from the top of the hotel.  Rooms are huge and super neat.  Huge property with every facility you look for in a luxury hotel.  Though it's heavy on pockets but it's worth every penny.,5
"I stayed for two nights in a club room. The room was very comfortable and had all the best amenities. The rooftop pool was spectacular. I was very disappointed with the club lounge breakfast service, as the lounge was open to all after 7.30 am, and there were little kids running around everywhere unsupervised. As a businessman I expected better.",4
Upon arrival- I was completely blown away. Marina Bay Sands has got to be one of the hotels of all time! The hotel is simply amazing and all staff were super friendly and easy to communicate with.  I am already considering booking my next holiday and staying here again! You will not be disappointed.,5
"In quickly looking at the reviews, I honestly have no idea how anyone can score this place below a four star.    But anyways, on to my review.  I was only in Singapore for two nights and when in Singapore for that short of a period, where else do you stay?  Rarely have I ever sought out the high end hotel as it's usually just a place to sleep, but like everyone else, I booked this place for the pool and nothing else.  I know it's a pretty lame reason to book a hotel, but the pool at the Marina Bay Sands is a tour site in itself and probably one of the most Instafamous places in Asia.  And with your recent crack down on only guests can go to the pool and the stricter rule of once you check out then you no longer have access makes it even more of a hot commodity.    I got the…",5
"As always never fails to amaze me how perfect the place is. Yes it is crowded as it is very famous and touristy. So love the deluxe rooms with the view of the bay. So relaxing at night looking outside with the city night lights. The pool, amazing. Was very crowded then as it was night time, would suggest to try the pool early morning though. Pricey but so worth it!!!",5
"Just to let prospective guests know what to expect...... Arrived around midday but nobody about to assist with unloading my luggage from taxi 20 minutes queuing to check-in Room could have been cleaner for example bedding not very fresh Tower 3 - if you're allocated a room below level 34 then you'll need to use two lifts to travel up and down to the famous rooftop pool/bars/restaurants  The setting on rooftop is quite spectacular - however not so pleasant when management allows certain nationalities to take to the water fully clothed! Yes you can swim and do your laundry at the same time!  Pool side food was quite disgusting despite the exhorbitant prices demanded by the hotel. For example the quality of the pastries, coffee and juices were all so poor. Quite shameful really to…",4
"There are so many varied reviews about this hotel but one consistency is the wow factor of the architecture. I mean really, who conceived the idea of a ship 57 floors into the sky lounged upon three towers! It's just unreal!   The check-in was a gong show (huge line of maybe 50 people) and yet I could see that the hotel was trying to make the long wait better with waiters serving mini ice cream cones (didn't help us who are celiac) and mini water bottles (it was disappointing that they offered 1 between the four of us) but it was a gesture acknowledging the line and for that I am grateful.  Our room was on the 31st floor and what a view we had.  We were harbour side looking out to the Gardens by the Bay and seeing the hundreds of ships in the harbour (both were really cool at…",5
We were very excited about the hotel but it felt like there was no soul more like a shopping centre as a lobby. The swimming pool was amazing with views which we're to the best in Singapore. The bar service was very slow on the verge of awful. But it is about the view ,3
"We really enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands! The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff can't do enough to help you. Our room was lovely and modern, well maintained and had a nice view of Gardens by the Bay. It was worth the stay alone for a visit to the stunning Infinity Pool! It's great to enjoy views over Singapore while cooling off in the pool and the staff came over to offer us drinks pretty much instantly. We did go quite early in the day which I would recommend as the pool was much quieter then and did get busy as the day went on.   On the downside check in and check out were a bit chaotic and did take quite a while. We were also hit with some extra taxes as we checked out we weren't aware of so be warned!   Overall I would definitely recommend but be prepared it…",4
"Spending a night in Singapore - then definitely stay at the Marina Bay Sands - just to dip into the pool and enjoy this amazing view. The access to the mall is handy, there are loads of restaurants, but the best thing is the proximity to the Gardens by the Bay.  The rooms are so comfortable and luxurious. The hotels grounds are very busy.",5
"If you are under 35 and fancy a zoo this is the place..... lifts are terrible and overcrowded towards check out time so plan ahead!! On the plus side the design is fab and its right next to the Gardens by the Bay, so fab in the evening. The gym is good  and if you have  enough money to buy Gucci Handbags and Jimmy Choo shoes then the shopping mall will hold your attention. Everything is super expensive.. and if you have laundry to do I suggest you take some washing liquid as its £5 for a pair of knickers...... The pool on the roof looks fantastic in the pix , but in reality it is filled with people taking selfies....not really my idea of relaxing.. and frankly it looks like it could do with a good clean and it just can't be hygienic...... As a once in a lifetime place it was…",3
"Our first impression, the bell boys was great, very good at dealing with the amount of people.... Staying in Club room, executive check in, like a supermarket deli, take a number?!! NEXT>>> Given room number & vague directions.. Got to lift lobby, 5 lifts, one out of order, serviceing the 22nd to the 57th floor. We waited & waited, finally got into un-air conditioned smelly lift, stopped at every floor. Room was amazing, view great.. Quick shower & headed to Club room, always stay in Club rooms, love the exclusivity and all the extras. Got to floor, eventually in hot lift, and all we could see was 20 or so people waiting for lift & a line. Deceided we must be on wrong floor asked a very harassed staff member where is Club facilities were, ""the line is here will be an hour or so""…",1
"Massive hotel along the lines of Las Vegas. Very expensive and, frankly, I didn't think it was worth the price. Roof top pool was spectacular with great view but very crowded. I didn't really like the location. If you want a self enclosed destination then maybe it's OK but I'd prefer the Clarke Quay area for wandering around.",3
"We stayed here for a couple of nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel really does live up to the expectation. From the moment you pull up there is someone waiting to take your bags, the reception staff were more than helpful, there seems to be someone waiting everywhere to assist you. The rooms are a very good size and have all the mod cons including curtains automatically opening when you enter the room. The pool is really the main event of the hotel, plenty of loungers and staff on hand to order drinks and food. Drinks are expensive on the roof but not too bad when you consider where you are. The hot tubs over the opposite side were also lovely especially at night. Worth a stay for a special occasion and a very unique view of Singapore. ",5
"This is definitely a place to be but as with such places, it is crowded - there are people everywhere. Excellent property with amazing views, facilities. Gardens by the bay, laser show, shopping, etc all available at hand  ",4
"Had a really good time at MBS, was definitely an experience. Stayed with one friend for a night before continuing our travels across Asia.   Whilst the pool is amazing and the standards of rooms are good there are quite a few 'buts' mainly when considering the price (it's extortionate). Firstly, you're paying for the pool and only the pool. The rooms are fairly average and I've stayed in far nicer. The pool is impressive but incredibly busy... if you think you're going to get a shot of yourself by yourself against the Singapore skyline, think again. There will be hundreds of people taking selfies and children splashing about. The breakfast again was good but have had better and not paid $400 a night.   Overall really enjoyed the experience, probably wouldn't revisit but am…",4
"Perfect location for sky garden, shopping centre and train access to get around. Pool is amazing and very relaxing. Worth staying  for an experience, I would recommend this to everyone, and the view from the gym and room was amazing.",5
"I was there for a congress. The hotel is gigantic.Very modern, very nice rooms,enough diferent places to eat . Staff was very friendly,professional. The hotel is of course world famous for its swimming pool on top. I was not too impressed: just too many people to be enjoyable. I recommend to go swimming early morning: you will be nearly alone and can then appreciate.   The bar on top is nice , great view but too noisy and very expensive....  Overall a nice experience but the prices for room , food and drinks are very high. There are extremely good hotels in the vicinity for less money. ",4
"Magnificent food on level 57 was outstanding, reasonably expensive but well worth the visit, very pleasant and professional wait staff in the restaurant. If you dine on this level you are unable to go to the observation level 56 (1 level below) without purchasing an extra ticket $23.00 SGD, however the view from the level above is just as good, after lunch we made our way to the guest lounge area for drinks which overlooks the stunning infinity swimming pool.",5
"Alright, this hotel is an important landmark that is why we stayed. Another reason is that there was no other way to enter the infinity pool if you don't stay in the hotel. The views from the sky park and the infinity pool are great and let's be honest, everybody is there for taking pictures. That's acceptable but beyond that, the hotel is nothing special, probably it would have been possible to find more decent stays at the price paid. For one night or two I can recommend but beyond that it doesn't make sense to stay here.  The hotel is incredibly huge and crowded. Infinity pool is very very crowded, nothing like you see in pictures. The deluxe room is not too spacious with respect to the cost, and there is no bathtub. No privilege or priority is given to the hotel guests in…",4
"I think the biggest draw of the MBS is that it's such an iconic part of Singapore. It's like you wouldn't have legitimately visited the country if you didn't at least spend one night here.  My husband and I did get an opportunity to stay here while on our honeymoon (we got the stay as a wedding gift) and I absolutely loved it. We were there when they already had their Christmas decor up and their huge Christmas tree at the lobby was a wonderful first thing to see as we entered the hotel.  We had a room with a view of the gardens and it was equally as spectacular.  I was surprised though, that the big pool at the roof deck isn't heated. It was freezing when we went up for a dip and thus didn't end up staying that long.  The beds are very comfortable, pillows soft and it's just a…",4
"Probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in throughout my travels. We stayed on the 47th floor with a City View overlooking the harbor.  The room was extremely spacious.  The hotel amenities are amazing. Naturally we went straight up to the rooftop pool after checking in. Yes, it is slightly crowded, but not obnoxiously so. Most of the people up there are there for the same reason - to chill out in a fantastic space and to take it all in.  We ate dinner at the bar / restaurant up on the rooftop - which was not bad. Nothing to write home about, and a little pricey.  But, the atmosphere can't be beat. We didn't go in the pool that night since we planned on waking up for the sunrise.  We ended up waking up before sunrise - used the gym facilities for about an hour and then…",5
"This was the first stop when I arrived in Singapore. My heart stopped for a while to enjoy the nice scenery and the tall buildings, the lake, and all the different attractions found there. I also got to take a selfie of the famous merlion. Inside marina bay, you will be amazed with the architecture and the lake inside the mall with canoes. it was fun to watch especially if its your first time. I waited for the evening to personally witness the light show coming from the top of the marina sands building. The whole experience was fantastic. I would definitely go back and experience it again.",5
"Ok, so you will read a lot on trip advisor, some good, some bad and some in between.  If you are wanting a boutique personal experience then booking into a 3000+ bedroom resort is not going to give you that.  If you want a value for money experience it depends on your income, your view of holidays and spending.  But again it is 5* in Singapore and the mall below has Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton and more - it isn't catering for those on a shoe string budget.  I paid £312 a night for a Deluxe City View Room, Room 3906 to be precise - what did i get for my money?  A room in a unique famous world renowned hotel with a great view and access to the infinity pool and sky gardens.  A room which had a safe, big TV, sofa, desk, twin beds, free shower gel and free tea and coffee.  No…",4
The hotel is very nice but the fact that we couldn't  stay at the pool the next day while we paid 400€ a night is absolutely intolerant. Even when we asked the personal that we only booked the hotel for that reason and that we were there before they got very unfriendly and unprofessional.  We only wanted to stay at the pool some hours. In every other hotel of this class they would find a solution and stay friendly.  ,3
"This is our second time here. Unlike the first time, I am disappointed with MBS this time. The check in and check out system were amazingly quick though. However, the room is so basic. The infinity pool at ANYTIME is always CROWDED. The hotel in general is crowded. Since Singapore is an amazing place, I will definitely go back there but would stay in a different hotel.",3
"This hotel is the iconic property in Singapore. It is huge and very impersonal as a result. Regardless, the staff are very good and very well trained -- the service level is excellent. Prices are stupid -- $30 (Indonesian, maybe $25 US) for a cocktail; food is similarly outrageously priced. The rooftop infinity swimming pool is cool for a photo or two. Rooms are fine but nothing special. Breakfast embodied harried service and a totally average menu and food quality. If you are in Singapore for one or two nights, sure, stay here, but if you are there for for longer then stay somewhere else and visit the Sands as part of your city tour.",3
"Ended up paying $70 a night extra for a City View room after finding out the Deluxe rooms are on the lower floors, with maybe little or no view.  Wow - money well spent.  Got a room on the 51st floor and we were able to watch the nightly laser show from our window.  Fantastic room and service.  A must stay whilst in Singapore and the only way to access the roof top infinity pool, which has an adults only section.  Fantastic views from the pool deck of Singapore city, the harbour and the Gardens By the Bay - watching the nightly light show from the rooftop was fantastic.  Not cheap, but a must do - suggest 2 nights minimum to cover all aspects.",5
This is the best place to be if your in Singspore   We had a time of our life experience   Do something good to yourself and book a night or 2 as we did   Absolutely fantastic  My kids and me will never forget this experience,5
"This hotel is expensive and other than the pool, which is spectacular the other hotel we stayed at in Singapore at the start of our trip before spending time in Malaysia was much nicer. This hotel is enormous and felt very impersonal. Not really good value for money unless you want to be close to the casino and a huge number of shops. Nice view of the gardens by the bay.",4
"I booked a king harbour view and was told we were ""upgraded"" to a city view. Arrived at the room to find twin beds. They should not accept bookings for rooms they don't have. I accepted free breakfast and a late check out as compensation but I remain as that was the best they would offer even when I threatened to cancel the booking. So I remain dissatisfied. The discussion took so long we were almost too late for dinner. The hotel is very noisy and busy with the many people shouting. Music in the bar too loud to talk. You are paying for the architecture and the view! The restaurant on the roof is great but no need to stay here to eat there. ",1
"The hotel is amazing, a truly 5* hotel. Rooms are fantastic and there is so much offered at the buffet breakfast. The staff are so friendly and don't mind helping you.   The infinity pool has a amazing view of Singapore.   I will be returning again.",5
"We stayed for 4 nights at the start of our honeymoon. We arrived on an early flight so was not expecting to be offered a room immediately, but to our joy we was offered one there and then. During our conversation the lady offered us a room on a higher floor as it was our honeymoon. We were over the moon and had a spectacular view over the bay. The room was great, huge clean modern. The pool, oh the pool. It really lives to expectations and it is busy but we still got to relax there. Great cocktails. We did go up to the pool at night and the water was so cold! That was not good. Perhaps a fault that night. But still nice to do. The hotel is great, huge architecturally stunning and the service matches the environment. You do have to walk through the shopping centre a lot to get…",5
"Love love loved it at the MBS! This is a hotel on steroids though! If you want to relax and don't like crowds and hustle & bustle, this is not the hotel to stay in.  It starts with check-in and the lines and the organized chaos. it is a bit of a production line and there isn't a lot personal about the MBS but it has to be expected with the number of people being processed and churned through at reception. They had about 15 reception staff at the desk all day and busy... but the facilities are great.  We were lucky enough to get upgraded as this was my bucket list birthday present and got the Junior suite which was a big as my home - separate bedroom, walk-in-robe with a dresser, bathroom as big as the bedroom and a separate lounge room! It was magnificent & luxurious in every…",5
"Stayed at this hotel during a short visit.  Was given a Double Room on the high floor with a city view.  The room was smelling musty and old.  The carpets looked like it needed maintenance.  The room was not soundproof.  There noise from people walking outside in the corridor could be heard inside - very irritating.  The hotel is very busy and so there is always noise.  For the amount of money that we pay per room night, this is not acceptable at all.  Walked around the Skypark.  Great views and the infinity pool was fantastic.  The problem is that it is always crowded and noisy with kids all the time.  Not enjoyable at all - Thumbs down for the experience.    Went to the restaurant for dinner - I had 2 vegetarian options.  Soup and Pasta.  Very bad experience.  The hotel needs…",3
What a wonderful place. Bucket list item checked off with their amazing infinity pool as well. We had a king club room which was Devine and had access to club lounge. The service was amazing where we were continually greeted by our names which blew us away as it was from people we just passed on the way in. Also amazing and delicious breakfast in the club lounge and the cocktail hour canapés were equally delicious. We had a club sandwich for room service and it to was amazing. We will definitely return,5
"I had the opportunity to stay in this hotel 2 times during the next august, moving and coming back in a south east Asia travel- The first time we had skyview room at 45 floor, perfect experience. The second time we had the opportunity for an upgrading in Presidential suite. Maybe this was related to some concerns in our arrival but the front desk has been perfect . What to say? in both situation everything perfect. Strongly reccomended. I visited othe topo Hotel in singapore, but that one is actually the best one for all",5
"We are just about to check out from our 4 day stay at this hotel! Our stay has been amazing! the hotel is a remarkable design state of the art! it is a must if you are visiting Singapore!  The views from the pool make you speechless and the pool itself is fab! great service, great atmosphere, a little busy but we agree that's expected if you intend on staying at such a tourist attraction like this!  Our room was great, immaculate, comfortable with a fantastic view of the gardens!  I cannot think of 1 negative thing to stay there is so much to do here, shopping, bars, restaurants, casino, it has everything! Breakfast was delicious and again service just brilliant!  The hotel seems to cater for all in different ways! Overall so pleased we booked this hotel will definitely…",5
"Everyone says that the view around Singapore is most spectacular from the top of the Marina Bay Sands (even superior to that seen from The Wheel). The only thing is that to go to the top and check out the view via the Lookout you will pay $23.00AU per head. To avoid this go to the bar (free entry) on the same level (other end), and buy a drink, or not, and you have the same view gratis.",3
"Huge clean modern hotel. Lots of facilities and amenities inside hotel / shopping complex. Check in quick, no queues like other reviewers have mentioned. Room very clean and spacious. View of city lovely.  Rooftop pool view amazing.  Imagine it to be busy in the daytime but evening was lovely. No complaints. If your one of those people that like to say they've been everywhere then you need to come for the photos from the pool😊  Would go again",5
This hotel was on our bucket list and we are glad we spent 2 nights there.  Especially to swim in the infinity pool with the amazing view of Singapore city.  see it in the day.  And at night it was so pretty with all the lights.  The Only draw back was there were lots of people everywhere in the hotel and pool..  we had to queue up for breakfast and for the lifts as well sometimes.  However the staff were fantastic and very helpful.  ,4
"I spent my last night in Singapore at the MBS hotel - I checked in at 5pm so I didn't have a huge queue to contend with like other reviewers. Nice room with lovely garden view - no bath, but nice white tea and rose bathroom goodies. The roof top pool was shut due to weather so I enjoyed the gardens light show from my balcony. Ordered room service and had to send the 17 pound glass of wine back as it was off. Pool eventually opened and there were wet and dirty towels and dressing gowns everywhere - an absolute mess up there - got the obligatory selfie and got out of there. It was the same sorry story the next morning - and I felt like a sheep with everyone else trying to get up there in their dressing gowns too in over packed lifts. Mall is big, but shop staff aren't friendly.…",3
"Wow!! It's really nice here. We enjoyed so much strolling around. Many shops to choose. Restaurants, etc... loved the view, the ambience. So modern. We're amazed of the fountain & light performance synced with the music. Amazing!!",5
"We stayed here for 4 days,the suite was perfect with view to the gardens with an exceptional huge bathroom.. View from the pool was absolutely stunning!! We didnt like that it was overcrowded both pool and lobby of the hotel,also that u have to pass entry check to the roof top pool,but in the end if u are in Singapore u must stay even for a night to this iconic hotel:-)",4
The beds and pillows here are probably the most comfortable I've ever slept on. Both the room and bathroom were exceptionally clean and tidy.  The free wifi is also good enough without having to pay the extra for better wifi.   The shower in our room did overfill and slightly flood the bathroom. We also asked the concierge for a HDMI lead for the television which they provided without charge but when we came to use it it wouldn't work. ,4
"Amazing Experience at Marina Bay Sands. It is really incredibile. The view from the hotel and the incredible infinity pool make you feel on the top of the world. Its like a city, with shops, casino, theatres, restaurants and bars. I really suggest to stay at least one night there. ",5
"We spent one night here as part of a three week trip around South East Asia for our honeymoon. We were really looking forward to this stay and this really didn't disappoint! At check in we were told that we'd been upgraded to a suite and wow what a suite it was. The staff throughout the hotel were amazing, be it at the lobby, concierge, restaurant, they went out of their way to help. Bar 55 afternoon tea and evening canapés were brilliant. The 5-7pm canapés also came with an all inclusive drinks list. Views from the infinity pool were spectacular, as were the views from the skypark. If anyone has a chance, I would recommend the skypark. If possible try and go just before sunset and watch Singapore and gardens by the bay light up as dusk approaches. All in all this is an amazing…",5
Stayed for 2 nights just for the iconic pool which was good. hotel have 3 towers and have entries at 2 sides from tower 1 and tower 3 taxi dropped at tower 3 side went all the way to tower 1 side as this side check in counter was closed and then got room on tower 3 again so it was quite a walk within a hotel before reaching room. breakfast spread was good but very busy. Casino is huge and nice. but best best part of our stay was pool right on top.,4
"The hotel is too big to cope with the capacity.. expect to queue for everything from check in, entering the pool area, going to breakfast and even had to wait 20 minutes for the bell boy to come get bags before telling us he couldn't collect them all. Staff are rude and not happy to do anything.. get interrupted every meal to the waiter putting the bill on the table before we've even finished. Hotel is too much of a tourist attraction... selfie sticks everywhere - no privacy. Breakfast was nothing special.. cold buffet.... all in all could have got a better experience at a different hotel such as Ritz or Shangri la where we saw better service. The hotel is trying to pose as if it's in Vegas but without the luxury, elegance style and service... very poorly done. Not even a lobby…",1
"My partner and I stayed for 1 night. We booked a club 55 room and on arrival got upgraded to a suite which was super impressive, actually way too big for what we needed but not complaining. Bed was extremely comfortable shower was awesome. The club room gives you free drinks and nibbles from 5-7  champagne, wine, spirits. But no cocktails. Was a bit disappointed with that. The pool is really good and the view world class. But so overcrowded with people and security is over the top. For us to get to the pool we had to go all the way down to the floor, walk through the busy mall, then up to level 55 then jump in another elevator to go to the roof. Bit annoying when your wearing your bikini going through the mall. First day we only took one entry card for the both of us. They…",4
"We stayed here for one night on our trip through Asia. The place is absolutely stunning. During checkin, we found out that we were able to checkin to our room early, which made our final day in Singapore so much better. Room was a tad smaller than the ritz, but equally as nice. Service was top notch from check thRough check out. The hotel has easy access to the mrt, which made touring around the city easy. Also close to the super trees!  The amount of restaurant and shopping options and at this place is insane. Unfortunately I was suffering from some food poisoning so I didn't get to fully enjoy, but it looked impressive! Did a few hours at the rooftop pool. Place is definitely one of a kind, but a bit crowded. Food and drinks were expensive as expected, but not egregiously so.…",4
"Amazing hotel with unique views of Singapore. This hotel is splitted into 3 towers with 57 floors each. last floor hosts the infinity pool, facing the financial district, it's stunning and it can be accessible only by hotel guests and the whole infrastructure is enriched by a casino, 20+ restaurants (some of them are  Michelin starred), a shopping centre, a tube station and the garden area which is quite impressive (Gardens by the Bay) and Singapore flyer is aslo located near to hotel.  If you're visiting Singapore, this is a must place!",5
We booked into the Marina Bay Sands for our final night of a 2 week holiday in Singapore and Bali. This was a treat and we were so excited. There was 5 of us in total so booked a triple and double room. Upon arrival we were greeted by the door staff who were the best staff we encountered. When we checked in both rooms were assigned and off we went. The rooms were 2 doubles and for the 3 girls in one room - a camp bed was added (tiny and uncomfortable) this was not worth the extra €100. Therefore we got 2 double rooms (one on the 37th and one on the 28th floor) and not a triple as expected. Rooms were nice and what you would expect. The pool was amazing and was the best part of our stay. Now onto the staff - the restaurant and bar staff are extremely snobby and only choose to be…,2
"Stayed in 8th march 2016 for a night booked through agoda to have an experience of Marina Bay Sands and it met all my expectation level.  Infinity pool is what i like the most.  Overall, I would rank 8 out of 10.",4
We are a family of four and we spent two nights here. The room was very nice and the infinity pool was spectacular  (but VERY crowded). The hotel did not cater for children. There is an age limit after 9pm which was inconvenient. All in all the service was good but expensive. Will not stay here again. Can get much better value for money in Singapore.,3
"The Marina Bay Sands was built to bring breathtaking experience. The construction has quickly become the symbol of an entire city facing the 21st century with an arrogant confidence.   The location is absolutely great. The resort gives direct access to the fuurist park ""gardens by the bay"". The resort comprises of 3 towers covered with a boat style rooftop with its world famous infinity pool, a casino, an an XL sized mall.   We had a family suite located in the top levels (49th floor). This room is very spacious and provides the very unique advantage to offer both views on the marina and the park.   Given the hotel size (more than 2000 rooms...), the service is very good. The restaurants are overpriced and there is nothing really amazing to mention about them. Better having…",5
"We stayed there for a night to celebrate our anniversary.  Only the bell boy's service was excellent.  They carried our luggage before we take it from the taxi's boot and informed us how the luggage will be sent to our room even though we have not checked in and do not know our room number.  We asked if there is any room upgrade available but it was fully booked.  Then I told the concierge if they could offer something special for us since it was our anniversary.  He said he will.  The room was spacious and had good views but the bathroom amenities were pathetic, not even branded shower set.  I stayed in Hilton in India, they provide crabtree & evelyn.  Upon return from our Infinity Pool, the only thing they did was using towels to make into silly swans and some rose petals on…",1
"Beautiful garden view room, great service and very good choice of food from room service menu. Infinity pool is really something to see, however a little overcrowded. Overall a truely amazing hotel, highly recommended. Thanks team, cheers Darren & Dallas ",5
This is a big hotel with lots of guests and lots to do. The service is very good but don't expect too much intimacy or the sort of surprises you get with smaller hotels.  Having been to Las Vegas I can see the similarities and I don't just mean the casino.  This was my first time in Singapore so  staying in such an iconic hotel was a must. It didn't disappoint. The pool was packed as expected and there were short queues for breakfast.  We had a high room with a stunning view of the city. In hindsight we might have preferred the garden view because the nightly light show in the Gardens by the Bay is simply stunning.,4
Excellent casino must visit please carry your passport don't bring any bags as the same will not be allowed in the casino. Coke is on the house and one can do bett with 2.5 sgd must visit in Singapore.,5
Fantastic experience and place to stay. We spent 5 nights there. Views from our room were over Gardens by the Bay which were truly stunning. The restaurant on the top floor was excellent and the night club was great fun. All thumbs up from our perspective.,5
"Whilst the roof top at and pool is awesome, the room accommodation is definitely 3 star at best. Certainly nothing like the other high end hotels in singapore.  Very much a revolving door of hotel guests coming and going and just felt like part of a cattle drive. Staff were pleasant.",3
"This is a magnificent building amazing engineering. However the food on the deck restaurant is awful and incredibly overpriced - would never stay here, there are better places. Couple from UK. Great view.",1
"Great location, hotel is on the pricey side but money well spent. Rooftop pool is really good, probably the largest rooftop, infinity pool I've ever seen. Lots of shopping, restaurants and the casino are all within walking distance underneath the hotel without the need of walking outside. amazing. Yes, I'd come stay again.",5
"Disappointed from the moment we checked in, took 45 minutes and one of the rooms wasn't ready even though after 3pm. No apology was offered, not what you expect from such an expensive hotel. Lifts were a nightmare, no air conditioning and waits were long. Definitely visit this hotel if you go to Singapore, you can get a day pass to visit the infinity pool, this is a must as the views are stunning especially at night But I would not recommend staying at this hotel, it's just not worth it The staff are very rude, especially in the roof bar, which is not what you expect when paying extortionate prices I would not stay here again ",1
Great location for people attending conferences and great view. A bit expensive for personal travellers but not a problem if your employer pays for it. Would recommend the rooftop pool and bar as well.,5
"Have just visited the place. We did not stay. Both inside and outside are magneficent. This hotel has shops and restaurants. It was very easy to approach. Labels are everywhere so you can track down everything you want. Additionally, it is very easy to find a taxi. Visit skypark as well if you want to!",5
"Staff was great, they made us feel comfortable in every situation. The guy that checked us in was very friendly and made us forgot about our dressing condition (we spent the night in bus). Even the guy in the spa explained me (twice) how to use the locker while I was totally naked making me feel very comfortable. Sometimes in places like Marina Bay you always feel uncomfortable. The roooms are good and the infinity pool is awesome. But.. one of the most important thing in a Hotel when you are abroad is the wifi, and that was orribile. Even when it was working it was slow, and most of the time wasn't working. Because of its mechanism it worked just when the phone was in use, and often it needed time to reconnect. And it doesn't work in every spot of the hotel. Of course doesn't…",3
"We were on a short vacation for three days and we decided to stay here. It was a huge hotel, and may be very crowded at times. There was a long queue on check-in counters, but check-out was fast as I used the express check-out.  Our room was facing the Gardens by the Bay and it is really awesome. The view from the room was amazing whether it be day or night. The infinity pool was amazing and is really worth it all, however, my son developed some rashes and felt very itchy afterwards so we decided to get back into our room right away. May be because of the water in the pool, I don't know. Staff were friendly, at least those that we encountered.  Overall, it was a great experience and my family was very happy.",4
"I stayed at the Marina Sands Hotel a week before the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix. My room had a city view and was in the middle of the three towers. The view was exceptional, especially at night and worth the small extra cost for a first time traveler to Singapore. The rooms were very modern and the flat screen TV excellent. The bathroom was spacious and the separate shower and baths high quality. The mini-bar had an automatic accounting system, by which anything removed from its position was automatically detected as being purchased. This was really annoying. Even trying to look at what was available in the fridge racked up a bill that I had to go and correct with the concierge. It also made it virtually impossible to place anything else in the mini-bar fridge without moving the…",4
The rooms of this hotel may not be the best but the view of harbour and merlion is amazing. Loved garden by the bay and the casino. Ample shopping and eating out options in the food court and shopping area attached.,4
We decided to stay here for a treat as we were only in Singapore for a few days.  We enjoyed MBS but not sure I would have needed to stay any longer than 3 nights.  The hotel is huge and seemed very crowded at all times meaning we spent a lot of time waiting for lifts and queuing for the breakfast restaurants.  The breakfast buffet was always worth the wait though.  The hotel is well located to view the nightly light show at the Marina and also for visiting Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum.    Family dining options near-by to the hotel are quite limited although there is a food court in the shopping centre underneath the hotel.  The Shoppes and restaurants are very much of the high end variety.   The infinity pool really was fantastic especially at night and…,4
"Room is clean, view is awesome- unblocked view. Easily accessible by train, good location right smack in the middle of cbd area. Love the infinity pool. Price is a bit steep though. Might consider staying there again          ",3
"Everyone should experience the Marina Bay Sands Hotel at least once in their life purely for the infinity pool alone. The views are breathtaking and it was worth it.   A couple of reviews on here complaining of the room being ""basic"" or ""dated"" which is complete rubbish - the rooms are huge, plush and modern.  The infinity pool is always busy but I wouldn't go as far to say it's overcrowded. There is a section for adults only and kids only. For a couple I do think it is easy enough to find a bed - didn't have any problems but for larger groups I would imagine it to be difficult to grab beds together especially at the front few rows. However there is plenty at the back. The pool itself is amazing - it's actually busier at night I found. It seemed majority of the hotels guests are…",5
"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel dominates the Singapore skyline and with good reason, it isn't just a hotel it is a modern day wonder of the world.  We stopped for 1 night only but the time we spent there will live with us for the rest of our lives. Initially we only wanted to spend a day on the roof top infinity pool, however upon finding out the roof top pool was only for residents we booked room only at a cost of £400 per night, well over our usual nightly budget, so our expectations were high....we weren't disappointed.  We checked in at 11 am knowing the room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. We were delighted to be told the room was indeed available and were handed the key cards after a warm and sincere check in. The room was on the 8th floor of the 3rd tower and we opened the room…",5
"Of curse is the pool the main attraction from the hotel. But together with the shopping center (wich offers a large variety of high class shops) and the water fountains show, was all what stood out to me. The pool area is divided: two pools for families and on pool for adults only. They are really strict with that rule and advice everybody who looks like under 18 to the family area, when someone doesn't follow the rule. However it looks consistent but it isn't. The poolbar is cheap (20 Dollars for a Burger, 5 Dollars for French fries and 10 Dollars for Coconut milk) and the room we had (Tower 3 - Room 1212) was big enough for 3 travelers. Acceptable for the price we paid! Otherwise i didn't find anything special at the hotel. Yes the view from the pool is great and in the…",3
We stayed on the 49th floor. The room was amazing with a balcony that overlooked the gardens and bay. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom very spacious. They could have added a makeup mirror. The lifts were fast although sometimes you had to wait. The pool on the top floor was unbelievable. There were quite a few people but it was well controlled and there was a section for adults only. The architecture was amazing. Try to get a package as it is expensive.,5
"We stayed here for 2 nights on our way back home from visiting the UK and wanted to end our trip on a high note! We are so glad we did! The hotel itself is a work of art - the architecture, structural engineering and view are second to none. Check in was efficient, and we were upgraded to a suite which was stunning and one of the largest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in.  It was palatial and would have been the size of an apartment. The room has everything you would expect from a luxury, 5 star hotel; quality comforts such as designer toiletries, toothbrush, loofahs, coffee maker, well stocked mini fridge, slippers and bathrobe. Bathroom was all marble and luxurious with shower and separate bath, bed was impressive, and a wonderful view of the Marina and gardens. The hotel…",5
"We arrived for a 2 night stay meeting family from Australia. The building is an amazing structure and wonderful look at at. However, we had to queue for 30 minutes at check in, the check in girl was lovely but all seemed very impersonal.  We went to our room which had lovely views of the city yet the decor is very dated, the tv did not work and some sockets were faulty. The infinity pool is amazing and is the one thing that saves this hotel. The most frustrating thing are the lifts, we waited on average 1 hour to get from our floor to ground, as the life's were full, very disappointing. My advice would be, do 1 night, see everything and then move to another, more pleasant, less busy hotel. ",1
"It was three days and two nights in heaven for us. Our room was large and comfy, trendy and well-furnished and we love the bathroom so much. For the pool at the top, we cant say much but SUPERB! Overlooking to the bay, have the sunshine on you and surrounded by the lovely city view. What a wonderful experience. Situated in a very strategic place, making you want to stay longer than your plan. And the staff - definitely nice and helpful! We're so hapoy with our stay.   We'll definitely come back and suggest this to our friends and family. ",5
"Upper level Gardens By The Bay / ocean view highly recommended for fantastic views.   Room furnishings were ok but nothing special - one would expect more for the price.  Maid service very disappointing - on our last night we found the maid had neglected to make the bed with a sheet between the duvet and bottom sheet.  We didn't bother to call room service as it was very late and we were getting up the next morning at 3 a.m. to catch a early morning flight to Hong Kong.  Perhaps the maid was too busy leaving her card with a washcloth shaped like an elephant to encourage leaving a tip to bother making the bed correctly!    The pool area view was nice and the staff at Spago exceedingly helpful and friendly with  good food and drinks.    Restaurants, which were very good, are…",4
"We've just spent three nights at Marina Bay Sands. Our room (deluxe room with a nice view on Gardens of the Bay) was large, extremely clean and well furnished. Bathroom also was very comfortable. The pool is an unique experience. Bathing overlooking Marina Bay is priceless, and we really appreciated the ""adults only"" zone at the entrance from Tower 3. The hotel itself is a little ""Vegas style"" though, a lot of people everywhere (A LOT) and the constant feeling of being in a giant mall. Recommended once in a lifetime for experiencing the infinity pool.",4
"When visiting Singapore you just have to stay in this hotel - at least for two nights! The swimming pool and the view from room window will definately take your breath away!! The higher the floor you get your room, the better, as the view will be more astonishing and the room itself is usulally bigger (or better to say huge in comparison with other hotels in the city).",4
"Marina Bay Sands located at a great location and is an integrated resort. It's very crowded everywhere. The staff here can't take care of every aspect. Our room is the premier room with sky city view. The room here is large but beds are not very soft. The washroom is fine with separated space. Our room is in tower1, the left one. I thought the room in tower3 would have a better view or the bay. The Infinite Pool is the best place or the hotel, which attract most of the people. We took lots of photos up there.  I doubt whether would I stay in MBS on my next trip to Singapore.",4
"Myself, son and daughter went on holiday to Singapore and Bintan Island. The MBS is like a supermarket freeway. The lobby is a complete highway road block and you queue for breakfast for 5-20 minutes. The roof pool is a 'Must Visit', but its totally full of selfie fanatics. Whilst there are beautiful things about this hotel, I really see it as highly over rated for the money you pay. I would rather have stayed in Bintan longer and would not return to the MBS.    I would advise the Gardens by the Bay and Clarke/Boat Quay.",3
"We stayed there only two nights and we had an amazing time. Staff there made everything so easy for us!they were very polite all of them and they we more than happy to answer all of our questions about where to go how to get there etc. The swimming pool has an unbelievable view and it was life time experience.we went quite late and it was not really crowded but I felt it was a bit dirty. Our room had a view of the gardens by the bay and we enjoyed the night show from our balcony which was much better as you can have a panoramic view of the gardens. Obviously it looks as a mall,a super amazing and expensive mall but the mall is separated from the rooms and the three towers and you do feel safe there!all hotels at orchard str have the same philosophy of having a super mall at…",5
i can tell this place is worth to visit especially for those who wants to 'hunt' some photos. it's easy to find good angle. and i really recommend you to visit on workdays bcs not so many people there. your photos would be no 'people' noises hehehe.,4
"I have given 3* for the pool and 1/2 of  the staff.  Basically this place is trading off the building which is quite amazing. The pool has stunning views however we stayed 1 night and that was enough. The pool is heaving and there are soooo many children. The life guards do there best to protect the adult only pool but they have given up with the adult only Jacuzzi! It's just not 5* luxury. The hotel itself I busy and just feels a bit like a shopping mall which in places it actually is. People taking photos EVERYWHERE.   1/2 of the staff are lovely and smiley and couldn't do more for you. The other half act like they are being forced to work there. In particular one lady in the casino was so miserable I left, as for the guy checking us out he said ""checking out? Room…",3
Every thing was better than the pictures. The pool was busy during the day though we did find out later the first pool was adults only which was perfect. We awoke early the next morning and were the only people in the pool. The experience was amazing and peaceful as the sun rose in the morning.,5
"We stayed here for two nights mainly due to the pool I always wanted to visit. the pool is nice, would be even nicer without the crowds... The pool is too crowded for swimming, the folks are mainly taking selfies. The pool area also was filled with sunbeds, which were usually very full. The staff is nice and helpful, the food and drinks were mediocre. The view of course is unbeatable. The hotel is a five start hotel, but nothing special about it. The room is very spacious, we had a view to the gardens by the bay with a nice balcony. We ordered from the rooms service once, the food was ok, but considering you in Singapore, the food in the streets is excellent.",4
"Stayed here for just 1 night and true to the reviews, the infinity pool and views were amazing but the pool was way too crowded for a proper swim. With the sheer amount of people in the pool, I had real doubts of its cleanliness.   Rooms were well equipped and spacious but nothing to shout about. Due to the sheer size of the hotel, it was probably asking too much for better service. Check in was impersonal and even the vip registration was full of guests waiting to be served. Room service came in an appropriate amount of time but the lifts here had bad frequency and were constantly full so if you are on the lower floors you couldn't even get in. ",3
I visited this place in day and night as well. This place has the very famous Marian Bay Sands hotel building overlooking the artificial lake. The place is open to all and is very well lit up in the evening. Most of the time there is a light show near the hotel building which can be seen from quite a distance as well. The whole area is picturesque and one can desire to go to the top of the 55 floor hotel building which has a viewing deck. Nearby areas to visit are Skypark and Cloud forest.,5
"Que to go up , your met by people every where it's like a holiday camp . Viewing deck over run . Prices sky high . Dirty loos . DONT BOTHER unless u want a photo only ...oh don't dress up they all wear drssing gowns .",3
Awesome place  Once in lifetime swimming pool experience  Must visit . The hotel is really beautiful with amazing view from the rooms and top . You can see the gardens by the bay light show from your room  It's looks like a paradise when you are swimming pool you must surely visit,5
Stayed at MBS for 1 night. There is nothing special about the room. Gives a corporate feeling to it. Breakfast was not provided and cost over $60/pax and the quality of food was very poor! The only interesting part of the stay was the infinity pool but it was over crowded. Though the poolside food at spago was great.   Overpriced hotel ,2
".... but otherwise, hotel was *meh*. It's pretty, it's clean but it's old and big for the sake of big. It really doesn't offer anything other than easy access to the gardens by the bay. The location isn't convenient for business or pleasure and it doesn't feel like you're in singapore at all.  Stay once for the pool access but next trip - try something else",1
Visit hotel lobbies.casino and shopping mall.Quite expensive to visit top level.Views great but you cannot access top level swimming pool.,5
"We love this hotel so much, the infinity pool wasn't fake! LOL its REAL!!! We had an amazing experience staying in this place as well as for dinner, drinks and shopping at the same time! Definitely will stay here again!",5
"We stayed in the hotel for a night and we had a gorgeous hotel view. The staff are very friendly.  And we were checked in early like 11 am I think because our room was already available though the standard check in time is 3 pm. Since we stayed at the airport lounge we paid like $50 USD for 5 hours prior to that because we had a late night flight from the Philippines. But we realize then that we could have get a hotel for $150 a night with a good bed to sleep. Well anyway it was an experience staying in an airport lounge with shower and complimentary snacks.   The hotel in Marina Bay Sands was kind of expensive but we had a blast during our stay.  Our room has a great view, and it's connected to the high end shopping center. Taxi drivers are very honest and polite. ",5
"This is just a wow experience. Take at least the club room and ask for a room on the highest floor possible. We stayed @ different floors: 36, 39 and 46 with city view. Very spacious and luxury. Great City view!! The extras from the clubroom choice are related to the 55 floor for breakfast and afternoon tea. Again with great views ont he city and seaside. Not to forget is the rooftoppool. Great city view from 57th floor in your infinity pool. All in all expensive but wow!",5
"Yes, Club Level is a bit more expensive. But you do not go to this hotel because it is the cheapest, you go to be amazed and spoiled, So when we were spending a few days in Singapore with our 2 sons (18 and 16 years old) we just had to go here and spoil ourselves with Club Level. And it was amazing, and we were truly spoiled. Spacious and luxurious rooms at the 44th floor (views!), complemantary breakfast with all the choices you can imagine at the Club at 55nd floor, free drinks with delicious appetizers at night. It was absolutely worth it!",5
"Stayed here with the wife for two nights at the end of our trip to Singapore. I am so glad we saved the best for last.  We upgraded to the executive package which entitled us to breakfast , afternoon tea and Drinks and canapés at the level 55 lounge. It cost us a lot of money (approx $A800 per night by the time you add the10% tax + 7%tax ) but it was well worth the expense. We didn't even have to go out for dinner after the drinks and canapés (which are served from 5pm-7pm) as we were too full from the smorgasboard of tasteful delights on offer.  Thank you to Vincent & Vella in the club 55 lounge for making our experience one to remember. If you can afford to treat yourself at this hotel you will need two nights minimum as there is so much to see and do here just in the precinct…",5
"We stayed here for 2 nights , it was absolutely fantastic. The infinity pool is beautiful especially at night . We went to club 55 and they couldn't do enough for you . Would definitely go back. Check in was fast and the staff was really friendly. The rooms are clean and a really good size . 2 nights was enough for us in Singapore. Shopping is amazing . ",5
"The last night of our holiday, we pushed the boat out to stay here. We were told upon check-in that we had been upgraded to a room on the 50th floor ( We couldnt believe our luck, we have never been upgraded before anywhere and to the nicest hotel suite I have ever stayed in).  Our room faced the back out onto the bay and we watched the ships coming in, in the evening. - We didnt mind at all not having a city view as you got that from the pool. We were given robes to wear to and from the pool which were a nice touch and towels were available at the poolside  The view was fantastic from the pool across the Singapore skyline and then from the hottub, you could see all across the bay and beyond.   We did look around the shopping malls and ventured out locally for food.   This was a…",5
If you are going to singapore and you are having a bit of good budget then you should surely opt for this hotel  Even if you dont have a good budget you could contact some agencies providing some affordable packacges Above all It is just more than worth going there Here they have an infinity swimming pool on 57th floor  It looks just great at night All the services are just great A bit expensive but great you know...,5
"What an amazing experience, after a not so cool stay at Staniel Cay arriving at Marina Bay was almost like getting to heaven, staff is friendly, knowledgeable and service oriented. The rooms are astonishing, the beach superb... hope to come back soon to get a top class service.",5
"Clearly an iconic structure and an engineering marvel however the only reason to stay here is to visit the pool and get your photo.  We knew that this hotel experience would not be the best upon check in. We were in a line for 25 minutes.  Once we reached the counter the lady was very nice, but focused on selling an upgrade (should be free after that wait but anyway).  We finally got to the room on the fourth floor in Tower 3 and I would say that it was on par with a 3 star hotel. It is in no way luxurious. The rooms on the lower floors have significant road noise, am unsure what they are like the further up the building.  The following morning we went up to the pool... be prepared for this to take awhile from lower floors, as you need to switch over to another lift well to head…",2
"We stayed here in July. This is a very big hotel and the staff act like it is a big hotel. You will not be treated as a special guest, rather you will be treated as just another guest.   Upon checking in, they lost some of our bags and when the bag boy came up he blamed us and said that we made up the fact that we brought any bags. He accused us of being liars and laughed at us when we asked him to look into it further. Looking at his reaction, we went down to the lobby ourselves to figure out the situation. We weren't able to get a response from any of the staff because they were all too busy catering to other guests. We had to go to the baggage room ourselves and they wouldn't let us in. We described our bags and they couldn't find them for 30 minutes. Finally, they let us in…",2
Nice and clean and view from gardens by the Bay is nice to see from our room! but building walls are becoming old maybe they need to paint it again..   I like infinity pool it's warm and clean! Worth the price!,4
Amazing place. Stayed here for 3 nights with wife and 2 young children in a garden view room. Yes it is very expensive but a once in a life time opportunity. Views from the pool are fantastic. Food and drink really good but pricey. Casino is out of this world!!  If you are looking for a bit of luxury for a short break in Singapore then look no further. Only draw back is that EVERYTHING is overpriced.,4
"So glad we took the opportunity to stay here as part of our trip. We were on 47th floor. Amazing views of the sea and gardens by the bay  The roof top pool is amazing and you have to swim in the day and at night to appreciate the different atmosphere. The beds in the water are tricky when trying to keep your possessions dry. There is an adult only section of the pool.  Cocktails by the pool are essential. The busiest pool times are after breakfast and evening as people await the sunset. Quieter midday and early afternoon.  Great observation deck and views of the F1 track.  There are plenty of places to eat - mostly owned by celebrity chefs but in the mall below the hotel is a hawker centre with street food of all descriptions. Very cheap, clean and excellent food. There are…",5
"Booked into MBS for 2 nights. The checked in was smooth even though there was a huge crowd. During the queue, bottle drinks were served which I can't recall it was practice previously. The counter staff straight away had a room as the check-in time was 3pm. Maybe it was due to 24 hours form submission I had earlier sent to the hotel.  The room was facing city per my booking request. Happy with the room lay out, cleaniness and tidiness. The only thing is no drawer for your clothing as the hotel expect the guest will hang their clothing instead. The house keeping was effective and efficient. Of course there is always small oversight. Looking forward to come back again if there is special promotion. ",4
"The room was spacious, modern and clean but looked like an ordinary room however the view was insane we had views of the gardens, the domes and the sea. The hotel offered many services and some which are exclusive to guests e.g. access to the viewing deck, the infinity pool and even discounts at shops in the malls. The pool is great but busy, it's a struggle to find a sun bed during the summer holiday.  There is a mall attached to the hotel with an abundance of restaurants and shops (including a casino) which takes you to the bay front where you can watch the fountain show. The bar Ce la vie is worth visiting as it offers great views of the city and is open to the public.",5
"Its not everyday you stay at hotel that has a pool like this. It has amazing views of the city  and with the price the downside is that its hard to leave. Even more so as we had club, great experience and views from floor 55, free champagne, some great food and excellent service. Our room was huge and could have slept much more than 4, and again had views of the bay and the city. Staff were more friendly than has been written in some reviews and to be honest I actually enjoyed the stay even though my wallet didn't. Sunset in the pool, overlooking the city - amazing.",4
"The hotel is breath taking and a good experience, if it is your first time to Singapore or you have not stayed here before I think it is a must.  We arrived early to our hotel, and the lady at reception was able to arrange early check-in, we went to our room on the 47th floor, we had a room facing the Gardens by Bay. The view was amazing, both during the day and evenings. In the day you can look out to the sea, and see the gardens from a nice distance, and in the evenings the gardens are lit up and you can even hear the night show taking place if you go to your balcony. The rooms are really clean and have everything you need.  The hotel also offers access to the iconic infinity pool for guests, this is on the 57th floor. During the day this is relatively quiet (especially when…",5
"To gain entry to the rooftop bar, we were required to pay $20. This money went toward a credit for drinks and food once on the top floor, however upon reaching the bar we found out one non-alcoholic lemon lime and bitters was $12!! However, the amazing panoramic views of the lion city made the ridiculous prices worth it. Will most definitely be booking in to stay at the hotel one day in order to use the amazing infinity pool.",4
"I will never come back to MBS again. The only positive aspect of this hotel is the infinity pool (but it is crowded with many and many rude people). The room is dirty, old and comparable to a 3 stars hotel. Check in is long and not possible before 3pm (check out 11 am.....not even 24h for a room paid 800sgd), service is miserable (the luggages arrived 3h later in the room and at the reception they forgot to give me back my visa and I got it back 4 hours later (of course they do not even apologize for that or give us a discount). It is impossible to sleep at night due to the noises in the corridor and the noise of the elevator. Never again!",1
Terrible service.  The price and the service do not correspond.  In the Room there was mold on the ventilation vents. You feel like a mass product being fabricated through the check-in process. In the evening the Lobby is full and for concierge service you have to stand in line for more then 10 min. I recommend seeing the amazing building from the outside rather then staying in it.  ,1
"Booked the deluxe room via booking.com. Was asked for an expensive deposit but not forced to pay, only unless you are to use their fridge and other services. It was really spacious and clean, with combined shower and bathtub. View from the balcony just overseeing the gardens by the bay towers. It was an experience swimming at the infinity pool although at night would be more fantastic overseeing the city lights. The pool was kinda crowded with tourists though but the view was enough to compensate. We were given only 2 room access keys which was also the entry to the pool. With that said only 2 people can enter the pool at a time per room booked which is a downer if you bring your family along. But it was a good crowd control strategy especially for the access of infinity pools…",5
"We stayed with friends and our 5 year old daughter on Singapore National Day!   It was a great experience and loved the pool on the 57th floor, watching the parade and fireworks from here was fantastic and memories we'll never forget!   The room was basic and service not personal based on the sheer size of hotel. Breakfast was not included and very expensive for an OK buffet had much better in other 5 star resorts.   Overall a great experience staying for one night in this iconic hotel but probably not to be repeated. ",4
"We only stayed here for 1 night, but hard to find fault with anything. We stayed in a club room on the 48th floor, with fantastic views overlooking the bay. The bed was huge and the bathroom was probably the biggest and best I've ever seen. Club 55 was excellent and special thanks to Miles who looked after us during the evening Cocktails and canapés two hour period which included free flow champagne and numerous other drinks as required.  The hotel complex is more like a small town, complete with it's own MRT station (Bayfront). An amazing hotel.",5
"We've booked this magnificent hotel for our honeymoon and it didn't disappoint our expectations. Check-in was quick and professional, although we arrive few hours earlier our room at the 28th floor was ready. Rooms are comfortable, with every amenities and amazing view over the city. It's a five stars hotel and you get exactly what you've paid for.",5
"We stayed for two nights. Very large family room. Very comfortable but only at second floor, so no views. Crowded swimming pool but what a location! The infinity pool on the 57th floor is really amazing. Pricy (breakfast not included) but a must do, once in a life time. ",4
"On arrival everything was so professional, from the baggage being stored to the check in. It was exciting and huge! One would wonder how they can justify the price for one night but what you pay mostly for is the experience. Some things/places are worth it. This hotel certainly is. This is not the place you come for just a bed, MBS has so much to offer.   There are restaurants and designer shops in there shopping centre which is signposted.   There are many restaurants scattered throughout the hotel. Personally I visited club 55 the views were incredible.   The pool itself was simply breathtaking you cannot take your eyes off it. What I would recommend is buying a waterproof phone case so you can take your phone in the pool and take pictures.   Also a special mention for Nicole…",5

"This place is truly truly the BEST place we have ever stayed! What they have created is actually very clever. Attractions right on your doorstep include the Gardens by the Bay, which at night are stunning. Ask for a room with a Garden view, forget the city, you can see that from the massive infinity pool on the very top of this beautiful structure. One major plus point is that they have a kids section. What I mean is that the kids section is where the kids go, they are not allowed in the main area of the pool which gives those of us who are on holiday with our spouse or another adult a bit of peace.  Saturday the practice for the Parade and it is brilliant, jets flying over the roof, helicopters carrying the national flag and then a great fireworks display at 8pm, best seen from…",5
"This was my 6th visit to Singapore (albeit the first for leisure) and, I suspect like others, I've long wanted to stay at MBS ...largely to swim in the pool!  It didn't disappoint. The hotel is an incredible spectacle, very well designed with excellent, comfortable rooms. We had a great view of gardens by the bay from the 38th floor.  The skypark and infinity pool is amazing and we spent a great afternoon up there. The staff were friendly and the amenities were all excellent.  However, at £550 for 1 night (for 3 people with drinks but no dinner or breakfast), it's difficult to justify coming again - especially with so many other great Singapore hotels and much more reasonable prices (I'd recommend the Westin certainly ...and they have a great pool too).",5
"Stayed here for 2 nights in May and the hotel is amazing. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. We were asked if we would like a city or bay view when we checked in, we were given a bay view room and the it was breathtaking. I'd highly recommend choosing a bay view room, our room looked straight on to the Gardens by the Bay and we could watch the light shows from the room. The rooms are also alot nicer and bigger than what they show on the hotel pictures, ours had recently been renovated. The rooftop pool was out of this world, the staff up there were so friendly. It's a must if you are ever in Singapore. If I ever return to Singapore I will be staying here again. 10/10",5
"What a hotel, what a pool, what a view.  Check was spot on, we arrived early but we're allowed to use the facilities whilst our rooms were prepared. Rooms and views exceptional, location brilliant and staff couldn't be more helpful and polite. If you go to Singapore you must stay at MBS",5
Positives: Great location Great facilities Attentive to clients Great mall and restaurants Modern rooms Amazing view  Awesome Infinity Pool  Negative points: Noise due to renovation works but they stopped when informed. Crowded since the mall and casino are inside the hotel. ,4
"The duty manager , Michael, was very attentive and helpful throughout our stay , while another receptionist also offered us a great room at the top floor during our check in .The great views in the skypark  coupled with great device made our trip really memorable . Would definitely recommend to anyone coming to Singapore for a weekend getaway .",5
"To get the best out of this hotel you need to stay for a few nights. We arrived mid afternoon and left to join a cruise ship next morning. The size of the hotel means you take some time to learn where everything is. We had an Orchid Suite on the 19th floor which was very nicely appointed and considering the size of the hotel, remarkably quiet. The Club Lounge gets very congested and involves waiting for a table. Snacks and drinks were usual club lounge fare. The Club Lounge was also the place for breakfast and was also busy. Service was very good and attentive. Food was fairly standard with a good selection of Asian and western dishes. Check in and out was a little confusing with two check in counters, neither of which had our booking,which was being handled by the Seabourn port…",4
"WOW! it is one amazing hotel the rooms there where gorgeous and there was an abundance of food to choose from I recommend eating breakfast at spago for buffet it is beside the rooftop pool and while I was there the manager brought my little toddler brother a stack of pancakes waffles and croissants because they thought he was cute, the people there are very friendly and hospitable. The pool there is like no other (sky infinity pool) you can see all of Singapore from up there. The shopping there was one of my highlights as they have the ""shoppes"" it has all high end shops eg: Gucci, Louis Vuitton (ect) if you are to go to Singapore this hotel is a must for at least one night ",5
"As someone who travels a lot and loves to see the world, I was told to stay at Marina Bay Sands on my trip to Singapore.   July 2017 - I have been to 4 different Asian countries before visiting Singapore. Each hotel allowing me to experience the WOW factor during my visit, unfortunately, except for MBS.   Before each flight I would call the respective hotel in order to book a hotel car to pick us up from the airport as I was unaware of how the public transport works in each place I visited and due to the reason that we needed a van since we had quite a few baggage. Before taking off my flight from Seoul to Singapore (which is 6h 20mins) I had called the hotel to book a car. The GSA first told me that I had to book a car 3 days in advance which I explained to him was NOT stated…",1
"We stayed one week here for business purposes. It's very convenient location for us because most our partners have offices in Downtown. Clean rooms, very friendly staff, lots of restaurants and bars, amazing view. Everyone knows the famous swimming pool on the roof. Automatic express check-out is excellent thing! ",5
"The Marina Bay Sands, it's an Icon of Singapore, the swimming pool it's really beautiful, but avoid rush hour!! I Stayed on Club level, so dedicated Check-In and nice lounge available. Room with city view is the best. The price is expensive comparing to similar Hotels.",5
"Travelling as a family of six we had booked an Orchid Suite and a Grand Club Room - and were spectacularly lucky when we checked in to be upgraded to a Straits Suite on the 51st floor with outward tilted floor-to-ceiling windows which I wasn't brave enough to lean on! True luxury living, two huge bedrooms with a karaoke room and a grand piano in our suite.  The signature 57th floor rooftop swimming pool is truly amazing - but full of people taking selfies - even at 6.15am - but the staff there are excellent and we always found a sunbed - even if sometimes on the side facing the sea, where there are hot tubs and more shade.  There are many great things about the hotel (especially the Lounge check-in team and there were some brilliant individual elements of service from fantastic…",4
We booked a club room for 3 Nights and loved every minute of it.  Our room on the 7th level of Tower 1 was like a Junior suite and enormous. A lounge area separated from the ample bedroom by the huge flat screen on a swivel base.  The bathroom was the largest of any hotel in which we have stayed previously was home to a massive free-standing modern bath tub with glass Shelving around it. Also a separate marble tiled shower room with frosted glass door was big enough to comfortably fit three adults if you so desired!  The toilet was similarly tiled and same frosted glass door. All opened onto the double Vanity.  The patio opened to a vast unobstructed view of Gardens by the Bay. The patio was bigger than our own verandah at home. Two sets of table and chairs included.   There was…,4
This place is an amazing feat of architecture and construction. Did not stay here but visited and was impressed with everything.  We ended up having dinner at one of the top level restaurants.  A must see if visiting Singapore.,5
"The hotel is generally known for its 57-storey swimming pool and this pool is truly an experience.  If you want to enjoy the pool you need to stay for at least two nights. In the pool from 10 to about 16 hours (check-out: check-in) is a few people, and also plenty of free sunbeds. The room was really large with a perfect view of the bay and the city. Huge hotel, a bit of a tourist factory.",4
"My husband wanted so bad to stay in this hotel so we did 5 nights, the building its self is an art, room are huge but nothing fancy just normal, and of course the pool is exceptional.  Over priced restaurants but in its mall so many restaurant choices.  We enjoyed it but it's a one time deal for us. ",4
"We payed about  AU1000 a night for 6 nights at MBS in July.  took up drinks and breakfast package. The place was too full. Waited for a while in lifts. Rooms are not luxury for the price. No comparison to Macau or Vegas. TVS are old. Pool was very full. Lots of people stay one night only and pool was so full. They have removed all shade to promote not staying up there for long. Breakfast they suggest get there before 8am. 3 venues but they cant cope. So you have option of breakfast in room. Go to Fullerton or another top hotel, We were ripped off.  Seriously not worth the money. A disgrace.  Seriously Id like a refund.",1
It looks great. The rooms were very nice. The pool amazing.   If I received the service I did in a 3 star hotel I'd be very disappointed   - long waits at lift - very busy everywhere always lining up - problems checking in - concierge couldn't/ wouldn't help with very basic requests eg hold an envelope for someone to pick up - problems with keys and no service - had a baby and they wouldn't let us book a cot. Had to wait until we arrived and then maybe it would be available - fridge is full with minibar and they offer service to change fridge which we paid them for but they never changed the fridge - One night we got a babysitter and wanted a drink before we went to an early dinner. We couldn't go to bars on top because they were full.  - other bars were for special guests or…,2
"Our second stay at this hotel. We stayed at Family room which was very big, has 4 beds, kitchenette, balcony, sofa like living room. Room quaity was nice. Take note that the family room located at lower floor near lobby/shops and don't have that Singapore view from top which usually you want if stay here. But fine for us as still can enjoy the pool and the view.",4
90mins in a lift to get to your rooms. Absolute Pits. STEER WELL CLEAR. 5star? Wouldnt even be a 1star. $1000 a night? Surely this place is taking the piss.do not waste your time. Toilet was blocked for 24hours also. ,1
"Beautiful hotel. Go there to admire the architecture. If staying as a guest, be prepared to the treated like a number (if you are lucky). When things go wrong (and during our stay something went wrong every day) the hotel staff are only interested in the lessons learned bit for the betterment of the company, but 100% ignore you as a guest. I have never stayed in a hotel where I paid so much money and received so little service.",1
"Just to clear it out of the air people coming here should not expect a Peninsula or a Swiss Palace Hotel, but for its size and being a casino related hotel, it is probably the best resort of its Size, better than the ones in Las Vegas.   The MBS team is very good and very nice and professional to its level. Being such a huge hotel I recommend not coming here with your heads up high thinking you're a King at the Claridges but that this is a resort for families, for businessmen, for guests looking for all types of entertainment.   The Front office is where one faces what he will expect at MBS so I recommend being nice a friendly to the front desk agents and they will be super duper nice to you and might even give you a nice upgrade. Big thanks to Mei Ling, Ramesh and Momoko. I…",5
"Myself and 3 friends decided to splurge on our last night of holidays and stay in the Marina Bay Sands and it was 100% worth the money.  The feeling of walking out to the infinity pool was amazing after being looking at pictures of it online for years.   The hotel is amazing and has so much to offer. All the main attractions are within walking distance.  If you are considering a stay here go for it , even just for one night you won't regret it :) ",5
"Nice view and location(Bayfront MRT Station), right beside garden by the bay, sky park is amazing, 23 storey-high hotel, right beside ArtScience Museum too. You can enjoy the night view and it is one of the best spot for photography lovers. ",4
"Excellent hotel with attentive staff, excellent amenities, buffet and pool.  We stayed in an Orchard Suite and found the price was reasonable for the room size and inclsions.  The buffet is also worth a look, plenty of cusine choices from all around the world.   Tip: Be aware that if you touch the mini bar you will be automatically billed.",5
"The Marina Bay sands is a massive hotel with casino, restaurants and luxury mall within. If you enjoy the Bellagio in Vegas, this would be a good hotel for you. The rooms were nice and the service was good,  but there were so many people. You have to ride 2 different banks of elevators to arrive at the pool and then, check in and out of the infinity pool with a key card for each guest, and then, you cannot find a seat. The pool is packed with people taking selfies. It feels like you are on an over crowded cruise boat. Also, they had jack hammers in the lobby everyday during our stay, working on construction of a new restaurant.  I will say the location of the hotel is very convenient and it is nice to have anything you could need in one place, but for me, when I am paying for a…",3
"* There was no hot water in the bathtub * swimming pool was too crowded and look dirty, people are there for not swimming but taking selfie. * the way they organize the breakfast section was really suck, it was too hot because it's kind of on the roof and open air, no aircon equipped. the staffs were really rude, they don't know how to smile in the morning I guess * the breakfast menu is really poor, I only had breakfast there one day, the rest days I ate in the mall * the fridge is computerized, so whatever items you take out from the fridge, it's automatically charged. If you don't pay attention to the note on the fridge, you are deadly charged, no staff in the hotel inform you about that by words Despite these minuses, the guys in front of the hotel were very helpful, they…",1
What to say about marina bay sands one of the most luxurious property to stay in singapore .we stayed for two nights the rooms were amazing and the hospitality was superb.the best part was infinity pool on 57th floor which was beyond my expectations . Overall experience was superb  One should visit this property atleast once.,5
"The hotel staff went out of their way to help us. Early check in (9am!). Great pool.  The breakfast buffet was surprisingly expensive, but a great range. Lunch on top of Singapore was fantastic. Close to airport and shopping.",4
"First impression: crowded. Queus at check in... recommendation 1: if you booked a suite: check in directly inside Sands Lounge, Tower 1! If not  or not knowing this (like us): stand in line and stay calm (staff serves juice and mini icecream). We had an Orchid Suite: given room was located on low level...Front desk: ""only one available!"" We checked room: spacious, nice, terrace.. BUT no great view and much noise from the street...so disappointed! I adressed Concierge: very friendly! Mr. Ramesh Govindsamy was able to find Suite on high floor - THANKS! Recommendation 2: try to get a room on a high floor (35+), idealwise in Tower 2 (so to have short distances to breakfast restaurants, gardens by the sea and to Club55); higher floor saves you from having to change elevators when…",5
"Congratulations ; I have had the best service ever. Thanks to Ken whom works on the front desk. He has been very helpful and organized my staying so well. The buffet for the breakfast is huge.  The pool is big and clean. The hotel itself it very clean and quite, and very central : possible to walk to Flowers Dome.... I will come back next year",5
"This place is the definition of luxury. They rooms were amazing, the staff were helpful. The whole hotel was lovely.  Location = perfect. 5 minute walk to a hop on hop off bus stop. Right on the bay, to walk around.   The roof top pool was awesome. (cold) but awesome. Stay here for only 1 night if you can afford it, and you will NOT be disappointed.",5
"ARRIVAL / CHECK-IN Our flight arrived early in the morning so we were at the hotel at 5:55am.  We approached the check-in desk and the agent had the cheek to say that check-in did not open until 6:00am; by this point it was 5:59am so we asked if he genuinely wanted us to stand to the side for 1 minute or if he could make an exception.  Needless to say, he agreed to check us in.  We had reserved a ""Grand King View"" club room and were told we would receive an email when it was ready and would have to come back to the desk at that time to collect our keys.  At other hotels they give you the keys and then text/email you the room number to save you having to line up again; it's a shame MBS does not have this.  It's especially annoying because the check-in area is permanently swamped…",4
"An amazing place to spend a complete day - an array of restaurants , plenty of shopping , museums ...so much to do and explore here.This place has beautiful views..must visit one of the  rooftop restaurants- either the Wolfgang puck spago or c'est la vie",5
"The highlight for us was the edge pool. The view is amazing, the pool is massive and allowed us plenty of space to catch a view of the city. The pool in in 3 sections with an adults only area which was great. The rooms themselves were good but nothing amazing (unless you are very high up with a awesome view) we were only level 13 City view - pretty basic. Lots to see and do in this area. We stayed 2 nights and if we could afford to would have stayed 5 nights. Lots of restaurants, clubs, gardens etc to walk to around this hotel",5
"we booked for one night stay (that's all we could afford). The main reason was the pool. you don't have to go back to room, but simply leisure at the pool overlooking the city is enough to experience. The room we got on the 33rd floor was overlooking the Gardens by the bay and the port. you would want to gaze at the scenery by the window all night. The hotel service is excellent, amenities are superb.",5
"We got the Club Room with City views at a reasonable price. Our only worry had been how busy the pool would be. Our experience in that regard was fine. Afternoons are definitely busier than mornings though. Also had no trouble securing day beds. We had a lovely stay.  But be warned that check-in (even for club rooms) can take quite a while. Easily spent 30 minutes there. You also need to carry around your pass at ALL times if you want to get anywhere in the hotel. The pace is also very high tempo. A lot people walking around at all times of the day. No personal attention. If that is what you require, this is simply not the place for you.   Gym was fine. Not crowded at all.  Breakfast at the pool was also of high quality. Just a lovely experience. I recommend it. ",5
"The hotel was awesome place to see. Clean, gigantic, and the epitome of Singapore. Check out the infinity pool feel like you are swimming around the cloud. The hotel is not too expensive and the service was great. Don't worry about shops, there are shops by the hotel. Must experience it!!!!",5
"The incredible architecture and location next to the Gardens by the Bay were the best part of our stay at MBS. The standard twin bed room was faultless - with comfy beds, lovely bathroom, excellent amenities and amazing views over the Gardens.  The rooftop pool was great BUT so full of people taking selfies that we only swam once. Spago for sundowners on the terrace was a highlight. Fantastic cocktails. Lovely to watch the sunset over the city.",4
"I've actually never checked in however I'm still waiting for my £390. I've booked a room through The hotel's website in the begging of May, I then changed my mind and cancelled it on 22nd of May.I've received a confirmation with a code about this. The booking was made for 29th of July for 1 night. I received another email ""Greetings from front office"" on 27th July , this was an email confirming my reservation for 29th of July. I immediately responded, resenting my 7 weeks old cancellation. The MBS sent me an email back saying basically ""ok""- misspelling my name - not Jelinkova but Kelinkova. What a surprise it was when an invoice arrived on 30th of July and my credit card was charged  £390. I wrote a few emails and I got a very luke warm reply that there has been mistake of an…",1
The stuff was very friendly. Room was big enough even with our child it wasn't to tight. The infinity pool is great and you get even later always a spot. View is great. The food at the pool is excellent. Drinks at the bar could be a bit bigger. Once you checked out you are not allowed to use any amenities of the hotel including the pool.,4
The Marina Bay sands is very good and has great views over the city. Food in the hotel and shopping mall are very expensive and the shops are overpriced. The beds are comfy and the wifi connection is good.,4
"My husband & I bought tickets to see the pool few years back when we were younger and could not think of affording a night at Marina Bay Sands. It IS still expensive but we finally could cut it off our bucket list!  We booked a room with skyview- our room was on the 45th floor in the third tower overlooking the shoppes and the water body. The room was much bigger than we had expected with good amenities and the bathroom was huge.The bed was large enough for us and our 8 year old. The sofa in the room could be turned into a sofa bed but we decided to keep the room open.The view was spectacular. At night, we even could stargaze lying down by the window.  The pool was magnanimous. However, as the day progresses, the water starts getting dirty - courtesy so many people and at times,…",5
"Definitely a sight to behold.  Despite being very busy...only about a 5 min wait tops for breakfast.  In all honesty.....without the swimming pool....a hotel with nothing else that is special.  Service ok...but you get chased to pay a bill after every 2 drinks...even if you give them your room number . Location is ok , as in next to the harbour / business centre for views ....but blimey you pay for that , and in all honesty....not worth it . Shops in the mall are great , but so over priced ...unreal. Stay in the hotel...to say you did it ....but stay again ....i doubt it ! And as an Engineer ...dont think much of the welding....phoor....i wouldnt pass it ....and hope the wind doesn't blow too hard. Would go back to Singapore....but not same hotel.",3
This is one of the best hotels I have been to. You don't need to leave the place it's so big with so much to see and do! Outstanding views and not to the mention the iconic infinity pool. The views are just brilliant from the pool. A must see in Singapore for both daytime and evening views. The basement is crazy! A 3 floor shopping centre with a casino in the restaurant!? Wow. Probably the only hotel I would visit in Singapore. ,5
"Infinity pool was the best part of the hotel. Good views and right opposite the gardens. Was given a room on the highest floor. Club rooms didn't seem that much bigger than a normal room but still decent. Great breakfast too- afternoon tea could have had more variety. Only downfall was the start of the trip when there was bad customer service from reception desk- even from the manager. However, we managed to resolve the issue. Most restaurants in hotel are also very expensive. Overall, great stay!",4
"That pool... Need I say more? It's worth every penny! Huge hotel with hundreds of guests, but all the staff are extremely friendly and make the whole experience feel very personal! If you can spend one or two nights in this beautiful place: do not hesitate!",4
One hour wait in line to check in and another hour wait for our rooms to get ready. We booked 2 rooms for one big family and the rooms were two levels apart.  It was a big waste of money and time.  Not recommend.,1
"Whoever designed this place should get some kind of award. It has everything. Check-in was a breeze and we arrived at 12pm, 3 hours before official check in time. Room was great with a huge bathroom and view of the marina and city. The Casino and Sky Garden was great. Loved the pool and service near the pool. Everyone was so kind that worked at this place. I plan on going back. This is one of the nicest hotels  i've ever stayed in. I will be back. It is a little pricey but worth it to me. ",5
"Excellent hotel, room, especial swing pool on the top roof. But, check in time too late 15h, no special, room rate no breakfast,  Anyway, perfect equipment, mordern, good location. Will be back if have time",4
"I have been visiting MBS ever since they opened. The property continues to amaze me. The room standards are still very high with no signs of wear and tear.   The service standard keeps improving with each visit.    The check-in and Check-out process was seamless.  This visit like most times we had the most stunning view of the city and the Marina.  The infinity pool on the rooftop was just stunning, providing a view of the city and the sea on the other side.  Shopping and dining can't be beat. Best of all brought under one roof top.  I have stayed at many 5 and 6 star properties in Singapore prior to the opening  of MBS and nothing compares as a complete pacakge under one roof.  With all this said, there is no doubt i will be returning not before long.  Thank you once again for…",5
"On my recent jaunt around roof top bars in Singapore I rate this one highly... Views both sides, of city and bay. Breeze keeps temp down and the infinity pool us stunning. It would be good to get clearer photos of this esp with no people in it but then if you had the choice as a guest to be in  the pool wouldn't  you...well if so many onlookers weren't gawping! The staff at the bar were fabulous, esp as alone. There would be excellent views of the light shows and sunset. Being made to feel welcome is a plus in a top rated hotel and they did this well.",5
"There is only really one reason to stay here and that is the incredible infinity pool providing views of one of the greatest cities in the world. The pool is unique and offers truly sublime views. Yes you can't really swim in it and yes it does get crowded, however nothing else really compares to the unique feeling of hanging your arms over the edge of the pool and seeing Singapore below you.   The hotel is truly vast, at times it feels more like a shopping mall in the lobby rather than a hotel. Checking in and out could be quicker, however given the 2500 rooms you can understand why you might have to wait 10 minutes.   The location is very special, right on marina bay with downtown close by and with it's own footbridge to gardens by the bay. The shopping mall and mrt station on…",5
MBS have 3 towers of rooms.  Checked into the 3rd tower.  Check in wait was short.  Good that they offered bottled juices /mini cones for guest which is a great idea as it calms agitated guest to a certain extent.    Room was spacious and view was good.  Dined at the Rise restaurant downstairs for dinner which had a good selection but can be a little pricey.   Downside was the pool was too crowded with people taking selfie instead of swimming😑  Nice to experience the stay once but would be better to enjoy the beautiful structure from afar,4
Really disappointed in this place.  below average room furnishings and design. lack of service. just a big touristy hostel that gouges you on price. the restaurants are especially overpriced and lacking.,1
"I've traveled to over 20 countries in the world, stayed in countless of hotels/hostels/motels from no stars to 5 stars. So I've got heaps of hotel experience to be able to tell which hotel is worth it or not. I regret staying here on my short trip in Singapore, to be honest if my friend did not wanted to 'experience' this hotel I would choose else where from the start. Firstly the exterior is amazing, but upon hotel entrance it's a total mess! Super crowded, no where to sit (which I worked out that they might did this purposely so that hundreds of people (hotel guests and none hotel guests) do not hang around to crowd up the lobby even more! I felt like I was lining up to buy a ticket to go into my room! I've been to Singapore before and stayed in a 4 stars hotel around Orchard…",2
"Since getting off of the cab it was perfect. Everyone was nice and caring. We arrived a little bit earlier than expected but we had no problems. As we asked for, our rooms were on the same floor. The room is huge, nice, amazing view of Gardens by the bay (you can see the lights show). And the infinite pool is all that! yes! Worth it. Amazing view. It gets full at times but you can enjoy it.",5
"Found ourselves in Singapore while travelling the world and thought wit the heck, let's stay here for the night. The infinity pool is awesome and the music, ambience, food etc is excellent but it can drain your wallet pretty quickly !  Room was gorgeous overlooking the Gardens in the Bay and was large, clean and full of complimentary goodies. I'd recommend it to anyone even if it's just to go to the top of the building to relax in that awesome pool!",4
"Spend 2 nights here, not cheap but worth the money just for the pool and sky bar. Had a room on floor 47 lovely big room with a massive bathroom and a balcony looking out over the Marina Bay Gardens which are amazing especially watching the light show from the room. Pool is open until late at night which we took advantage of. Pool does get very busy, never seen so many people taking selfie's.  Found bars very expensive for drinks, 2 large gin & tonics £58  but as on the 57th  floor guess you are paying for the view plus drinks aren't much cheaper outside hotel. Only disappointment was breakfast which did not live upto the rest of hotel standards. Would stay again if visiting Singapore",5
"The hotel location is really special and the metro station is right underneath. With a huge shopping mall in the same complex with restaurants and food court as well. The service is excellent at the hotel from all staff members. One thing that confused me a bit is that you do not have to shower before you go in the pool area and you don't even have to have proper swimming gear on!! People were in the pool with normal cloth, stuff like cardigan, t shirts etc.. even at night where there is no sun!! I found that annoying and inexplicable from a hygiene point! Other than that it is a great hotel!",4
"Wow wow wow, spent 4 nights here food and rooms were amazing! The views and infinity pool are breathtaking ! Had a few drinks at the rooftop bar , very expensive!  A visit to raffles hotel to have Singapore slings is a great experience . ",5
"I'll start with the positives: - Bathroom was fantastic though a bath could have been useful - In dining room service was brilliant and food was good  Negatives: - complimentary WIFI was spotty at time - TV continually kept freezing - Not enough lifts as all lifts were packed and took a good 30 minutes before one could fit in. Especially bad if you a placed on a low floor (we were on level 7) - Some staff had little idea of the building layout. I was sent to the wrong tower to locate the Banyan Tree Spa - All requests made by our travel agent on our booking were completely ignored (higher floor/city view) - Not the fault of the hotel but the hygiene of guests left a lot to be desired (coughing with out covering up, etc) - Crowded. Felt like we were staying in a shopping mall…",2
"WOW, WOW, WOW!! This hotel is incredible. My husband, myself and our 10 year old daughter recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights to start off our 10 night holiday in Singapore (the other 8 nights were spent at Shangri La Rasa Sentosa). I wish we had have stayed longer at MBS. We booked a Club Room King City View, this room type was nice and spacious, stunning views overlooking the city and had a pull out double sofa lounge that was made up for our daughter. I highly recommend booking a club room as it comes with all the privileges, which is daily access to club 55 for breakfast, afternoon tea, nightly canapés and alcoholic beverages with views to die for overlooking the city skyline, Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. Children under the age of six eat for free in Club…",5
"Spent a couple​ of weeks on holidays here with the family, was an incredible experience! Everything about this place is seven stars! If you stay on or above the 47th floor the breakfast bar is poolside and what a pool! Will be going back for a refill for sure! ",5
"We stayed at MBS hotel well...because it was in our bucket list (specially because of the infinity pool) Did we like it? I'd say yes. did we love it?...I'd say no specially.  The hotel feels crowded. It's HUGE and there's people EVERYWHERE. It doesn't feel luxurious but rather ""las vegas""-ish Which is OK! but I was expecting much more.  The main attraction is the roof top pool...which can be REALLY OVERWHELMING! you really have to watch out to avoid a selfie stick in your face! It's super crowded, specially before sunset....with lots of families with young kids (I even saw a family with a inflatable kid boat!) To get to the pool will take time...you have to change elevators, wait, get in line to get in... So, yes, if you are patient and lucky you'll get a instagram-worthy pic to…",4
"Booked a room purposely on a Saturday . As there will be fireworks because of NDP celebration.  Staycation for me.  I would say price it's a bit expensive. But for the fireworks it's definetly worth it.  But for tourist this will be one convenient location. shopping malls, attraction place nearby.  Generally : Staff are friendly , environment clean, spacious  no restrict of guest to hotel room, but for infinity pool will be 2 guest per room  The good thing: - snacks eg: ice cream, mango juice was served to me while waiting for check in. (1st time encountering it, WOW point man! - staff able to meet my expectation by trying to fulfill by request - In room dining served pretty quick, (24 hrs). nice food too - Definetly AWESOME view! - Requested items from housekeeping, items…",4
"Amazing place. Very nice ambience. Very well connected to the metro station. Pretty spacious for business meetings and conferences. Have lots of shopping options nearby. Water laser show in the night is amazing. Highly recommended, both for visitors and business professionals.",5
"By all means go and have a walk through and probably even go to the Skypark but DO NOT contemplate staying here!  We just had the worst 2 nights of our extensive, worldwide hotel experience. So many problems to mention it most of all, the people! It is jammed packed EVERYWHERE in this hotel. The pool is jammed packed, the elevators are jammed packed so you spend half your time waiting for an elevator and when you're finally in it, it stops at almost EVERY floor 😡😡😡😡  Check in is a nightmare! Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere if you're looking for a quality hotel stay. ",1
"This is one of the most amazing hotels in the world. The infinity pool was special in the sense that you could see the whole city's skyscrapers from looking out to the pool. In addition, the view from the top floor room allowed for you to wake up to garden by the bays and see the boats in the harbor. It really did look like a painting.   The only slight downside is that it can get very hot when going up/down the elevator from the pool area because there's a lot of family traveling up and down the elevators.  The architecture of this hotel is amazing and is worth the stay if you're willing to spend the money. Two night is enough, but one night would be just fine too if you can't stay here your entire trip!",5
"Wonderful hotel with a lot of facilities. Staff are very helpful front desk, concierge, room service. Anything you wish you will find it and they will bring it to you very fast. Infinity swimming pool on floor 57 is more than a breath taking. It opens from 7 am to 11 pm. Sunset view from the swimming pool is amazing. Food buffet in the breakfast is wonderful. If I will come again to Singapore I will definitely be in this hotel. ",5
"My memory of MBS   I travelled to Singapore with the impression of staying in one of the most recognisable and talked about hotels in the world . Sadly my time and experience there was very disappointing . I would describe the hotel and overall experience as ""a diamond with no sparkle"" There was a great deal of hype and excitement to see this world class destination but frankly I left with a mediocre experience , sour taste in my mouth and a memory of a hotel that did not live up to its reputation .  If you are looking for :  - a chaotic check in that leaves you feeling suffocated and like a cow being led to the slaughter house ; - an overcrowded pool with hundreds of people talking selfies of themselves with the view / themselves pointing to the view /sitting on the chair…",1
"The Marina Bay Sands is a destination, one of those ""must-do's"" in Singapore. As a destination, it is a great place - catering for rich, or pretend-rich, people from all over the world, coming here to experience luxury in the forms of nice rooms, infinity pool and great bars, all situated in a pricy and luxury part of town.  If that is the sort of experience you are after, then consider this a 5-star, must-visit, place, and read a different review. If however, you are more into real luxury destinations, or like me traveling for business, the Marina Bay Sands may not be what you are looking for. Read on for details.  --- too many tourists, too little service --- The Marina Bay Sands is more of a resort and experience location than a luxury hotel. This means that the hotel common…",3
"The best thing about this place was the very early check-in that we got at about 6:30am. Our flight arrived well before schedule, so we tried to get in straight away, and bingo! Thank you Pearl at the counter, we were able to go straight to our sky view room in tower 3 and enjoy the view, as well as the obligatory photos in the pool, before it got too crowded. We went back later, mid afternoon, but the pool was soooo full of people, we just left again. The room was very comfortable in a sedate sort of way with plenty of space. We can't comment on the service as we never required anything but that early check-in, great.",4
"Fantastic and enormous hotel. The check in takes too much time, had to wait for about 40 minutes just to check in which is bad for a five star hotel but after that it's a wow experience. The rooms are big, quiet, nice, comfortable, missing out to use the hairdryer in the bathroom and there is not a real makeup mirror in the bathroom, just a loose one you have to move around. The pool area is wonderful, the breakfast is a rip off but fantastic, try to get it included in your price. The staff is fantastic and we just loves every minute here! ",5
"Friendly staff, lovely food and several restaurants to choose from. Rooms big. There were 3 of us in a room. We requested a city view which was amazing. The best is of course the infinity pool. Quite crowded but there are 3 of them so we stuck to the adult pool. Coming from South Africa it was expensive but truely worth the experience.",5
"This hotel will have you awe inspired from the minute you approach, the iconic building yes but once inside a delight to behold so tastefully done but on a humungous scale.    The views from the roof are phenomenal but expensive at circa £25 per head and you get one drink,  if your not a guest. The skypark and botanical buildings adjacent are some of the best I've ever seen.",5
"Spacious room with a great view. Infinity pool is crowded. Even though it is a quite large pool, it is not for swimming, it is just for taking pictures. It also looks like little dirty. I think noon is the most calm time for the pool.   Most people stay in the hotel for the pool. Because this is huge complex, it is a bit crowded. Service is average for this price range. I think you can get better service for this price on other hotels in Singapore but you cannot beat the view.",4
"Also Singapore is a city that never sleeps! Hotel is amazing! Only to see from the outside! It's a small city on his own,with 60 restaurants I was unable to taste everything. Excellent parking service to park our Porsche, amazing reception, nice staf,amazing room with amazing bathroom,clean and luxurie, super view from the top swimming pool! Once,or if you can few times in a life time to do.",5
"Stayed at the grand clubroom at the Marina Bay Sands recently.  The room was comfortable though a little large for just the two of us.  Worth mentioning is the excellent cocktail at level 55 which came with the package,  featuring an assortment of canapés,  artisanal cheeses and delicious desserts,  not to mention free flow of champagne.  Special mention must go to Kamille whom I met during a very early morning breakfast before my appointment in the city.  She was attentive yet unobtrusive, warm and went out of her way to ensure that everything was fine for breakfast.  ",5
"The service was impeccable, staff are very efficient and friendly. If you like overly loud music whilst dinning in the dark, choose ADRIFT by David Myers. I had to leave it was so noisy. The room service was the best.  I cannot describe the atmosphere at Spagos, other than fun. A good selection of cocktails not to be missed",5
"We paid double what we have ever paid for a hotel room to stay one night at the end of a week in Singapore and it was worth it. The room was gorgeous, bathroom amazing, view of the city stunning and then their was the infinity pool. Check in was very quick and efficient which was a relief as we had heard it could take a while. We didn't have much money left after paying for the room but did find enough to enjoy a Singapore sling at sunset on the pool deck which was as good as the one at Raffles.",5
"We arrived at Marina Bay Sands and was in the queue to check in to our room. We were then ushered by a staff who also brought the rest of the queue to another check in desk. Expecting a 5 star service, of course we were disappointed.   Of course the view was perfect. We had the view over the Gardens by the Bay. The infinity pool was beautiful, towering over the amazing view of Singapore. However, the pool deck was infested with people. You have to look out for available benches in sight, if not wait for the next available bench which could be forever.. Children are not allowed in the infinity pool of course. Several life guards on duty.  The evening sunset view left us speechless. You could also have the view over the Central Business District of Singapore. There was a warm…",4
"We wanted to visit the famous infinity pool  on the 57th floor, so I booked a room for one night - it was one of the more expensive options with club access. The room was nice, the pool quite amazing. Then some issues one would definetely not expect for a SGD 1.000 rate per night: 1) Check-in and check-out takes ages, 30-45mins. (Ok, there's the express check-out option where you have to sign that the hotel can charge your card as they want and you have no rights to demand changes:) 2) If you have kids, prepare to pay. Club access ""included"" in the room does not apply to kids. Every time you enter, it's SGD22+tax per child. So if you want to have the ""complimentary"" afternoon tea, evening snacks and breakfast with two kids, it's some SGD150 extra. 3) You are allowed to have two…",3
We had 4nights spent at this hotel (14th to 18th).  We can say the housekeeping services did by their staff Xiao Yu was heartedly felt.  She changed clean towels daily on those towels I laid on the sofa/chair for our sitting & replenished extra coffee packets.   Many thanks to her services rendered well. ,4
Landed in Singapore.. college friend whisked is to the most iconic place in the country.. what architecture.. what a place humming..& happy.. so elite.. There we we got the view of the city.. so panoramic..  went to the Casino too.. ( won a small Jackpot ).. Infinity pool at night.. pity they close early..did not swim much .. just some pictures  So safe & secure.. the hotel it's amazing..clockwork precision.. you do not see much staff around.. yet it's run so efficiently..& 👍🏼👌🏼,5
"This is the best hotel experience I have ever had in the world. I can say all of the obvious stuff about the hotel and all of its amenities....(which are spectacular) but nothing like the Skypark on the 57th floor with an legendary view of Singapore's skyline. Oh yeah, there's also the world's most amazing infinite pool. The time lapse video of this engineering wonder is incredible. ",5
"Stayed here for 2 nights with my 2 friends in June in their Deluxe room with lovely views of the Gardens by the Bay. They had originally allocated a floor on the 30th floor for us but was accommodating to our request for an early check-in and compromising by offering a room on the 3rd floor. This ended up being a big positive as it turned out because despite the many rooms there are in Marina Bay, there were only four elevators to service each towers (3 towers) with one of them being closed the whole time we were there. Truth be told, I could really only notice 2 of those elevators really operating. This was a pain as you can imagine the amount of guests there are in the hotel, so within the later part of our stay, we resorted to just using the fire exits illegally. Fortunately…",5
My friend and I stayed one night at the Orchid suite and it was amazing. Photos and reviews will not do justice. But it all started with good customer service from Gideon and Sam Foo. Will never forget them. The food and staff at Club55 were also top notch. Will definitely come back again.,5
Super.. if you're thinking to book this place.  just do it.. splurge.. well worth it! loved it. Everything about this place will blow your mind! Stop looking at the website.. book now. Thank you Marina bay sands!,5
"Hotel managers Joseph & Cindy were amazingly kind in helping me plot a huge surprise for my dear friend, who actually was not aware that I had booked a room!! But actually I went to the hotel one day in advance and brought the bday gifts & balloons that Cindy then wonderfully set in the room ready! When arriving there with my friend, I said I found a key on the floor and tried to convince my friend to go with me and see how the rooms look like! After firstly refusing to do so for fear we might end up in jail, my friend was a good enough friend to just follow me around, and when I finally opened one door, the balloons were there at the entrance to greet us!! You can imagine the shock and surprise!! On top of this, Joseph was so kind to send us a very delicious birthday cake and…",5
If you are staying in Singapore you must spend 2 nights in this hotel. Hotel with latest amenities and infinity pool. The view from the room was breathtaking. Good shopping mall with almost all the latest stores ,5
"Its our first time coming here and we had a suite on the 44th floor. The looks were very iconic . The pool is so so amazing, there were a lot of people, but its really worth visiting..the rooms were clean and staffs were very helpful, kind. i would recommend the spa as it really relaxes you.",4
"I liken a stay at Marina Bay Sands to a day in Disneyland - its a dream place, somewhere you just want to be but after one day you are all Disneylanded out.   MBS is incredibly busy and you are treated politely, professionally but more as a number than a person , the foyer is huge and manic you queue then check in is lengthy,  security is tight, the one key one person policy is unwavering - up in your room while your mouth is still open from taking in the view and your surroundings you learn 'the rules'  if you press a button beside your bed you kill the power and if you move anything from the fridge you will pay $10. Finally time to get swimming costume , robe and slippers on and  ride the 2 lifts to the 57th floor  (stopping on every floor) oh  the anticipation, but you arrive…",5
"We stayed here for 3 nights after flying in from London and before we continued to Bali. Nice hotel but we wouldn't return.. the photos of the pool on 57th floor make it look so peaceful and amazing - although it is very amazing it certainly isn't peaceful. We were very surprised to see that the pool was full of kids (even up until 11pm at night) and it was so loud and certainly not peaceful. Why they wouldn't have had an adults only section or a time limit on children being allowed up there I have no idea. I appreciate that we stayed in a child friendly hotel but I couldn't believe that these kids were being so loud and splashing people in the pool, running around the loungers etc and no one did anything about it. We had a premium deluxe room I think it was called and we felt…",3
"We had a suite on the 47th floor overlooking the bay & Gardens. The view is outstanding especially at night with the show of lights of the Gardens. There  is a very small balcony but no seating. The room is quite spacious with a separate good size bathroom. A large shower recess, bath & double basin, good bench space. The suite was very clean & quiet. Our suite included Club Room access which was quite good if you went there before it became busy as once the Club Room was to capacity we had to wait to be seated. The staff there though are extremely friendly & accommodating. The Infinity Pool is Ok, views from there are amazing but you also have to get there early to claim a lounge on the pool edge. There are a lot of people there & we were thankful there was a designated pool…",3
"This is a massive resort style hotel with thousands of rooms and thousands of guests.   It is famous for its pool in the ‘Sands Skypark’, but also has a mall, museum, and casino just to mention a few things on the premises.   It may come with a larger price tag than other hotels, but it is more for the novelty of seeing the pool and the views from the top.  The views from the top are amazing. The skyline of Singapore and the bay area on both sides of the hotel can be seen.   The service was what you would expect at such an extravagant hotel.  Once the check-out line was getting longer, they moved a lot of us to another check-in/out area which was great.   I stayed in a Premier room.  The room was large and had a nice balcony overlooking the bay and Gardens by the Bay.  There is…",5
Truly an  amazing experience.  Nothing at all to improve upon. A fantastic and memorable stay. Staff and facilities were superb. Attention to detail was phenomenal. Beds and pillows were so luxurious. The infinity pool is incredibly good especially in the evening with all the lights of Singapore below. Please treat yourself to this amazing experience!,5
"Very beautiful place and worth to stay. Visited starting of this year. Plan to go again. Great customer service and friendly staff.worth to stay again and again..""pool and the view is the best food is also good",5
"First of all: Impressive!......... Disney Impressive...  The place was CROWDED, TOOOOO MUCH PEOPLE!!!   The room: it was nice, tidy, clean, very good size, AMAZING VIEW....  The food: plainly good, expensive (but all Singapore is expensive), but it took a long time to arrive...  My stay was payed for, but i wouldn't pay for that in a million years, there are way better alternatives like Fullerton or the Ritz...   And NO I REFUSE TO BE THE A5$#""!$ IN THE INFINITY POOL INSTAGRAM PIC.",3
"The property , ambience everything truly lives up to expectations. The adjacent shopping mall which is connected to the three residential towers is a treat. The food court is amazing and it has everything that one could wish. The location of Marina bay sands places it above it competitors, walking gardens , the beautiful marina area are just a few steps away. Last but not the least the, infinity pool on the 57th floor is an experience within its own right. Every time i went there if was like a big party going on. The staff was courteous although the check in can be a bit of an hassle, the staff at the front desk are well trained and ensure that your needs are met. Try it if your pocket allows, staying at the Marina bay sands is an experience ",4
"I booked a suite for $1000 per night. Upon arrival it took 35 min in waiting line to check-in only for find out our room are not ready at 1pm.. Then to our surprise our child can not access pool unless we pay $50 extra.. Then to more surprise his break fast does not include in room rate and we have to pay another $45 per break fast. To top it of ""Michael"" the service manager provided what I consider a street level service. I travel extensively around the world and stay at affluent hotels all the time. This is a real shock to me how this was handled today! I asked for General Manager and he has yet to find time to connect with me. It's not really about $$ here. The point is their website fails to disclose terms of booking ( unless you read a very fine print ) and one can never…",1
"Everything about this hotel is impressive. The building itself is a work of art, the large lobby impresses you the minute you walk through the door, the patient polite service you receive through check in, the United Nations of guests that inhabit the concourse and the rooms themselves, all done so very well. Of special note, the staff of Club 55 were always a pleasure to interact with, and always made you feel welcome. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Is it perfect? No.  Its biggest issue is due simply to its popularity, so that the pool area is always crowded, and the buffet can get a bit loud. These are not reasons to avoid those areas, they are just not the places you go for peace and quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and appreciated the hard work of the…",5
"Amazing hotel with 5 star service and facilities. This was a bit of a splurge but well worth the money spent. Celebrity restaurants, high end shopping and services. Close to Gardens by the Bay and an MRT station inside the shopping precinct to get you wherever you might be going.",5
"Email & feedback, no response since 3 weeks (helping foreign friends doing booking):  Other than the previous disappointment (guests not allow to check-in even-though authorization letter had been submitted), it seems like your department has yet to improve from there on it's system/SOP. MBS has too many rooms to handle. After standing around waiting for 1.5 hour, the compensation of 2 hours late check-out was only considered just an one-to-one exchange.   Happened in June 2017:  1) And it was real unfortunate to hear that your department forward another friend “A”'s reservation detail to “B”. This is individual PRIVACY. No reply since on this feedback.  2) It doesn't has a platform to differentiate like other hotels: -a) The one who does the reservation (Regardless given Log in…",1
"Beautiful and glitzy Marina Bay Sands has all the conveniences one needs for a luxurious stay in Singapore.  As you enter the lobby, you can see the windows and sunlight pouring in from the pinnacle of the roof to the spacious ground floor.  When you go downstairs, you will find a mall, casino and MRT station all without leaving the building.  If you go on top of the roof, you will find the much talked about Infinity Pool that will make you catch your breath.    Nearby, within walking distance are the Trees in the Cloud Garden and the iconic Merlion Park.  A truly clean, safe, efficient and multi-cultural city with polite and friendly people all around!  There is nothing bad to say about this place.",5
"When I first entered the hotel I expected the hotel lobby to be very huge, and it was indeed. The hotel has three towers all connected at the ground floor with the endlessly high ceiling. My room got upgraded from regular size room to the junior suite. It has spacious a dining room, two living rooms, and there is a balcony which facing the beautiful view of 'gardens by the bay' and the bay. I cannot tell much about the staff, since I did not have much contact with them. The pool is definitely the selling point of this property, I could spend whole day just to relax enjoy the breeze, the view, and swimming is my favorite sport anyway.",5
"I had a transfer in Singapore and went straight to Marina Bay Sands hotel to get the mandatory view. I am so happy I did it. This view is a must see. If you can only visit one thing in Singapore, let this be the one. You can see most of the city - and you can drink a singapore sling, while you do it :)",5
"To stay in one of the world's most iconic hotels is a treat.  Not only a landmark itself, its a place to really spoil yourself for a day or two. Full mark s to staff and especially Julie at check-in whom was gracious friendly and treated us to a high level floor, and to Reggine poolside and her mates who treated us so well while we had the hard task of sunbaking. The service from the staff, considering how big the place is, is always friendly and patient, and appreciated by us folks. Rooms enormous and views breathtaking, very spacious and the theatrics with the curtains upon entry a bit of fun. It was also very very good to have the balcony to step out onto. Poolside, without saying is where everyone tries to get to and it fills up fast in the afternoon after check-in - but we…",5
I visited Singapore for a week or so back end of 2016. This hotel is really amazing and can be seen from various points in the city! I enjoyed my visit here although is obviously expensive! The cleanliness of it is certainly on point,5
"I have been living and working in Singapore for over 30 years and our stay at MBS has been part of a very fon farewell to the island state.   First impressions are that this is a slick operation and there is a sense of an immense amount of planning behind the scenes. My wife and youngest son have also spent a fair amount of time in F and B and the service sector and they both have a very clear sense of what works well.  Plus points. MBS clearly sets out to look after its customers. Room service is excellent and each person who makes face to face contact with customers has been very well briefed. The concierge desk foes a great job and dealt with numerous queries in a prompt and sensible fashion. Really, the service ethos is to be credited. The rooms are also airy and spacious.…",4
"The hotel itself is fine. If one wants to be picky, then the lobby suffers from being some sort of elongated corridor linking what are three different hotel buildings (i.e. the various towers of the hotel). As a consequence, the lobby lacks warmth, and its cavernous interior only serves to act as an echo chamber for the constant passage of people and conversations.  However, it is the design of the hotel and the behaviour of its guests that caught my eye. In days gone by, temples were built to act places where we could place the gods and worship them. Humans would look upwards to the temples and gods (think of the Parthenon for instance). In this hotel the columns support a pool area wherein the humans array themselves, taking copious selfies while perched on high. It is as if…",4
"During a 2 night stay in Singapore we stayed at the marina bay sands for 1 of those nights. Booking into the MBS for our final night in Singapore was one of the best decisions we have ever made.  If you are reading this review to help you with your first trip to Singapore then you will be happy to know Singapore is really easy to explore,they have an MRT system that will take you to any part of the city quickly , cheaply and comfortably.   Due to only visiting Singapore for 2 nights we booked our first night in the Park Regis hotel located near the Clarke Quay area. This decision was part of our plan to use the first full day and night in Singapore to explore the city and do as much sight seeing as possible. For our second day we then checked into marina bay sands , there really…",5
This is a wonderful hotel but cant help wondering if it is a victim of its own success being so busy. The queues at the lobby for check-in and for breakfast and even for the lifts can be quite long at time. However the facilities are really five star. We stayed in a lower floor (4) and facing the gardens so there was a bit of traffic noise. I don't think I would stay here again as I don't think it offers good value even by Singapore standards. Fortunately I wasn't paying for the majority of this trip to Singapore.,4
"We stayed here for one night and had a very nice room with balcony on the 24th floor.  First but the elevators. Indeed, to access the pool you need to change on 34th floor and there is no direct to 57. This means you have already lost 5min going from 24-34 & you loose about 10more going from 34 to the pool. DO NOT FORGET ANYTHING IN YOUR ROOM!! Second but the fridge. They installed an automatic mini bar like you can find in Vegas. But first off we weren't even offered the choice to have it oppened (fridge is locked). So therefore you have nowhere to put your drinks. To get what they call ""a personal fridge"" you must pay 10$. Not huge if you are staying long BUT this is a very big NO for me. Any 3,4* hotel you have access to a fridge for free. Third but is for the parents who do…",4
"An icon of modern Singapore, the rooms are clean, large and luxurious - our Skyview option also afforded us high floor panoramic views of the city. The in-house amenities are thoughtful and there were plenty of modern options to connect and recharge. Housekeeping were conservative in supplies despite 3 people staying in the room but these were easily replenished by calling housekeeping. The infinity pool is a big drawcard and is a fantastic way of seeing the Singapore skyline and is only open to hotel guests - despite this it was still very crowded and at times bad behaviour from fellow guests detracted from enjoying this wonderful facility.",5
"After watching a TV documentary on this hotel I always wanted to stay there. We booked a marina room which didn't disappoint. Bedroom had marina view and bathroom looked out to the sky garden. Unreal views. This hotel is huge, because of this you don't get the personal touch from other hotels. That's to be expected. We did get an upgrade and early check in which was great  Throughly recommend this awesome hotel",5
The hotel is beautiful the rooms excellent but the staf in the hotel they are not kind they treat the people very bad  also in the restaurant on the pool the staff they are very rude and mean if I go again I will think about staying in this hotel because of the staff they don't know how to treat the turist ,1
"Stunning building and surrounds, nice room, quite pricey, swarming with people by the hundreds on their phones not watching where they were walking in the lobby areas (hundreds of kids). The pool was people soup, horrible. Too big and busy, like a mini city. Not good value. Although a stunning masterpiece of architecture and design, I'd rather stay at the Raffles.",3
"We recently stayed at MBS for 4 nights in Deluxe King rooms.  The decor is tasteful and the rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms, with everything being spotlessly clean. Service was excellent with everyone we encountered being very friendly and welcoming.  Concierge and Check In desks were very helpful.   In regard to disability access, we were dining with a disabled family member one night and were informed that provided slow careful speeds were maintained our relative was able to use his mobility scooter in both the hotel lobby and through to the restaurant. It might be useful to know what toiletries are included.  Apart from the usual tissues, shampoo, conditioner, body wash & soap, there’s body lotion, shower cap, dental kit with mini toothpaste, packaged comb, packaged…",5
"We had 3 nights in Singapore and decided to stay one night in Marina Bay Sand, just so we could swim in the pool. And it was so worth it, the hotel is absolutely amazing !!!! First it starts with the check in, what a great system with barcodes for your luggages , it's very practical and well organised especially with the number of rooms !!!  The Room was absolutely stunning, natural colours, beautifully decorated, very modern yet very warm, calming and comfy. The bathroom was great and what a view !!! We chose to stay on a Ocean side room and it was a great idea ! The view of the boats, Garden by the bay and the flower dome and cloud forest was just amazing and calming ! We were on 36 floor. The pool was a unique experience !!!! What a view !! Whether it be early morning,…",5
"Such a beautiful hotel with so much to see and do there. We didn't go to the Casino or restaurants, as it was just a night check-in, but we managed to get up for a swim and gym workout. Just amazing views from the roof top with one end sectioned for adults only which was good as there alot of young children swimming and splashing with not a huge amount of room to swim around in as it was pretty busy.  The room was fantastic with plenty of room, very clean, comfortable bed, but no so comfortable pillows (which the case in 90% of hotels we've stayed at).  Overall it was very resort style with people everywhere, such a busy place with many people looking up around them to take in all the views. I wouldn't say it's worth the money in my opinion as I've had better service in less…",5
"When deciding on a stopover location won our way to Europe we decided on Singapore. As first time visitors to Singapore we decided the iconic Marina Bay Sans was a must and we weren't disappointed. Amazing restaurants (Spargos was our favourite), and malls below the hotel to keep out of the heat, we loved lazing around the infinity pool and was happy that it was separated for couples and families.  Our room looked over the Marina Bay Gardens and was a real treat.  Would stay here again. ",5
"This hotel....this city....this cultural experience...FANTASTIC!  From the moment we arrived it was nothing but awesome.  The rooms were spectacular, the breakfast buffets in the skypark every morning were delicious, the view from the rooftop infinity pool and  the spectacular sunrises just made you feel whole.  The staff was very helpful and more than accommodating.  The location was great for shopping in the attached mall (which was more than exquisite), walking distance to the Singapore Flyer, the Gardens by the Bay and the bus lines.  Did the Hop-On/Hop-Off tour buses and they pick up and drop off right at the hotel. Can not wait to go back one day.  Singapore is an experience in itself!  Don't stay anywhere but here!!",5
Our stay in MBS was amazing. We loved the hospitality of the staff esp. Ms. Diane in the front Desk.she was so helpful and very professional. My kids love the sceenery from our room.Inifinity pool is the best. It was in deed a great experience. Thank You MBS.,5
"We arrived at Marina Bay Sands for a belated honeymoon in May 2016 for 3 nights. The hotel is an iconic and impressive landmark within Singapore and we were incredibly excited to be visiting and staying. I emailed the hotel prior to arriving asking a few general questions and stated that we were visiting on a honeymoon. The guest relations service promptly replied and noted it was a special trip and answered our queries.   As we arrived at the hotel, we were taken to the Tower 1 entrance which is grander and nicer than the other entrance. Tower 1 is also probably the best tower for your room to be in. The building is vast and a magnificent structure and the hotel lobby seems more like an airport than a hotel. We arrived early (at 9am, when check in is at 3pm) – so we chose to…",5
"I don't think there are enough words to explain how terrible our experience was in this hotel. We went with high expectations all of which were shattered entirely. Firstly the service was unbelievably poor and the communication between different levels of staff was entirely shocking. It seemed impossible to relay a message from one person to another. Secondly and even more surprisingly there is a complete lack of infrastructure in terms of transferring between sections of the hotel [there are 3 towers & 50 plus floors].  We waited 40 minutes for a lift... This mind-boggling delay caused us to miss the wedding ceremony that we had travelled thousands of miles to see, causing untold levels of distress among ourselves & the rest of the wedding party. Due to the insufficient…",1
We had a staycation in Marina Bay Sands..... was celebrating my daughters birthday....enjoyed the infinity pool.... had both morning and night city view.....breakfast was good. Room had a nice view of gardens by the Bay. Enjoyed seeing the NDP preparations. ,5
"Marina Bay Sands is a landmark building and is worth experiencing. The highlight of course is the infinity pool at the top.The rooms are big and well kept. The response time of the staff is surprisingly fast for a hotel of this size. The hotel is clean and the view of the city is amazing. It is convenient to find transport and also has a metro station close by. Though a bit expensive, the hotel is a must stay at least once for all visitors to Singapore. ",5
"Perfect location, iconic hotel! We stayed at a garden view double room on the 40th floor this time and i actually loved it. Last time we've tried city view. Both are worth it. The room with a garden view has a small terrace with a direct view at the gardens of the bay - the view at night is magical! We saw a star wars light show from the terrace!  The rooms are nice and clean, but as you may know it is all about the swimming pool at the roof. The swimming pool is amazing! You should definitely try it :)   Many shops and restaurants just a minute away from your room. The subway is connected to the hotel. ",5
"We love coming here!  For such a large hotel, they provide the most amazing service!  And are able to fix anything without any fuss and don't mind helping you out.  We always book to be met at the airport and it then is totally seamless!  There can be a little wait for restaurants but not too long and well worth it!  Though it is worth booking on public holidays in advance.  The bakery is really good and has a large selection including coffee, smoothies, fruit, breakfast and lunch food.  We took some snacks from here for the day!  The pool is always busy.  ",5
"Phone message told me to ""please wait as we are experiencing high call volumes"", when actually the booking office was closed and no one was there to answer my call!!  Receptionist swiped my card $400 too much for deposit, asked for explanation and she BS her way how this is ""company policy"". Stood there until I made her realise the only way out of my onslaught was to admit her mistake and apologise.  Keycard locked me out at the pool as it did not register my late check-out. Asked the towel counter for help, asked to wait, 20 mins later asked again the next shift staff and was told they ""have no contact with downstairs"". What stupid liars who can't come out of a better excuse.",3
"The hotel is very nice and clean, staffs are very friendly and helpful, roof top swimming pool is quite attractive, the food court "" Rasapura Masters "" has a lot of very delicious cuisines from Europe to South Asia. It is quite worthy to stay though the price is a bit expensive. The only thing that I am wondering whether can do better is that the size of the double beds are little bit small. We booked a deluxe room with double beds, one for our daughter and the others for my wife and me, the size of the double bed seemed a little bit small although we didn't really mind to squeeze close to each other:=)).",4
"The staff at Marina Bay Sands were very polite and demonstrated great sincerity and initiative to give me and my wife a most wonderful wedding anniversary to remember. They greeted us personally and escorted us up to our rooms; They surprised us with rose petals and bouquets over the room; They further surprised us with delightful decorations every day. Thankfully, the weather was great and it allowed us to enjoy breathtaking views of the city landscape and the opportunistic fireworks display.",5
"This hotel definitely has the wow factor. The views from our bedroom and the infinity pool at the roof are amazing. The check-in took far too long- about 30 mins, and pool is overcrowded.  Funny how the project was totuted 10 years ago as being a major job-creation project for Singaporeans- the majority of staff are foreginers (Filipinos, Chinese mainly).  Service was very good (apart from the slow check-in). Our daughter had her 9th birthday on our last morning there. The staff sang a birthday song and presented a cake- very personal touch. Staff also remembered my name by the second day.",4
Was very unsatisfied by the hotel service.. The room service suggested me to drink tap water from the bathroom when I asked for water for my 10 months old daughter... Not worth the money at all... It's crowded and the management unable to provide service.. ,2
"We have stayed in Sands for number of times..be it short getaway, school holiday break etc. The rooms are so far clean & well kept. We get to see Gardens by the bay night scenery from our balcony, which is spectacular.   Everyone will rave about the infinity swimming pool ..well, it all depends on crowd. Sometimes, it can be so crowded that you miss the fun. Try going during lunch or dinner time, when you get lesser crowd. Breakfast? So far, i find it too crowded. And prefer to eat elsewhere.   From Marina Bay Sands Hotel, you can walk across the overhead bridge (Lions Bridge) opens daily from 8am to 11pm.",4
"Me and my friends stayed Marina bay sands second time. But this time they upgrade us and gave us a 2 bedroom suite. It was definitely wonderful, luxury, adorable! Very high quality equipments, very large room and everything you need.  Infinity pool was wonderful view, Ce-La-Vi Restaurant also was luxury and tasty. Only one thing that I disappointed was very few 50$ black jack tables in the casino :) and also all staff were surly in casino! But overall, I definitely recommend Marina Bay Sands.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is an impressive hotel from the silhouette to the actual clockwork mechanism that makes such a huge property work so well. I was given an enormous room on an upper floor, always impeccably kept. I asked for a nespresso machine and it was provided immediately. There is no breakfast included or even a breakfast room but the hall has half a dozen restaurants and bakeries to choose from. Very efficient check in and out. I was forgetting the iconic pool in the terrace. Better in photos but still an inescapable experience",5
"I had a very pleasant experience when I checked into Marina Bay last week. The front desk officer, Diane was very, very patient with all my questions. I would like to commend how she handled my inquiries in a very professional manner. Kudos.",5
"As a highly discerning traveler, this hotel was overall very wonderful. The rooms are clean, room service was very quick considering the enormous size of the hotel, and the pool was superb!   Some reviews mention that the feeling of staying here can be impersonal, however anyone who books a stay here understands the sheer size of the property.   My personal experience was great, every restaurant and food order was perfect, and the hotel service was very pleasant.   Only downside was that many of the casino dealers had poor attitudes. One dealer in particular went out of his way to not acknowledge you.   I would certainly return and I cannot wait to come back again :-)",5
"Stayed for one night in a family room.    The room is really nice and comfortable for a family of 4.  They are located on floors 2/3, so don't expect a great view.  The room has a nice balcony, and again is very spacious for a family of 4.  Went to Spago for an overpriced drink and buffet, service was poor.  The pool area can get busy so plan accordingly, and get ready to deal with ""selfie"" madness in and around the pool.  It's entertaining in itself to watch the number of phones in the pool.    Being close to the shops is nice and the MRT station is below, so easy to get access in and out.    I'm not sure I would stay there again - I would probably pick something a little more boutique like, ie Naumi.",3
"This hotel does it's best to minimize its environmental impact so you can not only enjoy all of the lovely amenities, but feel good about staying here too.  The service is excellent and the food was outstanding.  The 55 Club is a must, and the infinity pool is a wonderful experience not to be missed.  The location is very close (walkable) to many attractions including shopping, the Flower Dome, Cloud Dome, Supertree Forest.  I highly recommend the Marina Bay Sands to everyone staying in Singapore.",5
Loved the sky deck restaurant. Wonderful location. MRT station connectivity is good. Check in and Check out process is very smooth. It was an amazing experience. Very close to Gardens by the Bay and Flyer Wheel,5
"What a wonderful hotel and stay we had. This hotel lived up to the hype. We had a very large room with wonderful views of Gardens By The Bay. Huge bathroom with shower and bath. The infinity pool is an amazing sight. The view it offers is wonderful. The water was very cool but it was so refreshing. The pool is only a privilege for hotel guests. Plenty of chaise lounges available. Pool service, food and drinks were great. Spa was very friendly and allowed us to shower after we had checked out to be refreshed for our long flight. The night laser and music show were great. If I ever visit Singapore again I will definitely stay here again. ",5
"The hotel has an infinity swimming pool where you can soak up all day without being bored. From this pool you can see the entire city, it's great. There is also a casino for you to entertain. Breakfast is very nice.",4
"We knew that it will not be great, but decided to give it a one night stay - for the kid to try the roof infinity pool, to see the views, etc. But honestly, regret this decision a lot, ecspecially after spending 3 nights at Four Seasons, which was one of the best of our hotel experiences ever.   I think the business of MBS is built primarily on the ones staying there for the pool and the views. Other than that - the hotel is humongous and inpersonal. The number of people is like in a conjested London tube on a rush hour. The price is a rip-off for the service and amenities. The pool is nothing special, stayed there 10 minutes, made a couple of photos and left. The view of course is great, but whether it is worth it - NO.   My wife was unfortunately not very well and as our…",2
"Stayed in Marina bay sands for a week on business/pleasure, stayed in a Club room which entitles you to the Club 55 Lounge benefits, they are all high floor rooms so great views of the Singapore skyline and city. The lounge in on the 55th floor, great views, good food selection, staff are amazingly friendly and professional, the down side was that you normally had to queue/wait for a table for breakfast and Evening drinks and canapés (normally only 4-5 minutes). It was a very very busy hotel during my stay, 2000+ rooms...lobby was particularly busy. The pool is spectacular, the views are like no other, it's spread across the 3 towers on the 57th floor, a bit cold but very nice ) during busy times getting a good deck chair or 2-3 together can be an issue but do recommend this…",4
"The Marina Bay Sands is a wonderful experience on every level - from the amazing infinity pool and SkyPark on the roof, beautiful rooms with great views, outstanding and gracious service, fantastic dining (highly recommend the 55 Club option) and proximity to the Flower Dome, Cloud Dome and an outstanding mall. It's worth the splurge to stay here and experience all that the Marina Bay Sands has to offer. Made my trip not only to Singapore but to Asia!",5
"Hotel is obviously expensive but more than worth it! The views from the room are always good (city center or gardens by the bay). Swimming pool is a very special experience. Don't hesitate, just do it! :)  ",5
"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a Big new hotel right on the bay.  The rooms are large, new and modern.  Plus, there is the infinity pool on top of the hotel.  Pay the extra for a Sky View Room, it's worth it.  we arrived just after ten on a Saturday morning and they let us have our room right then!",5
"So many things happened in one day  1) To start with we waited for 1 hour only to check into the room at 4.30 pm wen 3 was the checkin time. we were literally waiting in the queue for an hour.  2) Mr suren, at the reception desk was extremely rude. His so called hospitality made us feel unimportant. On telling mr suren about having more checkin counters he said they were fully booked so an issue . its was mainly about his tone and attitude which made us unhappy  3)  We had made bookings through bookings.com and we were of the assumption that we had booked a city view room.maybe we made mistake while booking.  Again on highlghting the same to mr. suren he said we never promised any thing. it was a very uncanny behaviour by him.  4) We mailed the hotel twice about wanting city…",2
We went for cocktails to Ce' La Vi bar & restaurant on the rooftop at the Marina bay Sands Hotel. The service is excellent & the Singapore Slings were superb we also enjoyed pizza & calamari while watching the lightening in the distance surrounded by the amazing views of Singapore from their open rooftop bar. We truly enjoyed the night & didnt want to leave,5
"I have experienced a few sights in my life that were difficult to grasp due to their sheer scale and strangeness - the Majlis Al Jinn, Burj Al Arab, the Address Hotel on fire, the Scott Platform.  The Marina Bay Sands is such a sight.  The immense scale and improbable geometry demands attention from every angle.  The view from the room (47th floor if memory serves) is as if from a plane, and swimming in the infinity pool where the city meets the sea is simply unreal.  They have actual paving stones and trees up there, a garden high in the sky with jacuzzis and waiter service.  It reminded me of Iain M Banks descriptions of Culture leisure spaces in his sci fi novels.  The top floor bar and restaurant feels as solid as the ground - yet have nothing but empty air beneath them, for…",5
"This is a one stop shop for the bucket list seekers! The views are so amazing! The luxury is ridiculous. You can be on a budget or go all out! Military discount is available. Dont worry about city view, you will get that for the pool scene.. The Ocean view is pretty spectacular and cheaper! Drinks on the pool can be expensive so look at the prices first.  This is a must go to place in Singapore",5
"Yah, yah, it is very expensive but if you are staying at this architectural wonder, you need to be in a Marina Bay Sands suite. With free access to the pool, gym, Club 55, you can make a stay worthwhile.  The suite is very large and plush. Great amenities and cute touches like the towel animals show an attention to detail. Service was exceptional our entire stay as we spent our all our time just enjoying the hotel. There are lots of other options in Singapore but nothing as spectacular as the Marina Bay Sands.",5
"Pro: Marina Bay Sands has become one of popular icon in Singapore. The unique architecture, the views, the infinity pool, and all the attractions around the area are just incredibly awesome. The room is clean and nice.  Cons: I arrived at the check-in desk around 3 in the afternoon, and it took them almost 45 minutes to find the right room for me, eventhough I've booked and paid for the room couple months back.",3
"The building itself is undeniably amazing; the architecture and engineering is a modern marvel and the view from the rooftop is breathtaking. However, the actual experience is like watching a Hollywood Blockbuster with a bad script; lots of razzle dazzle but lacking a soul.  If you have past experiences at staying at high end hotels you will be disappointed. The service was a solid 3 stars and times worse (saying this the restaurant and wait staff were excellent). The problem is that due to sheer number of rooms and it would appear (from my check-in experience) many people only stay a night, thus the churn is enormous.  We are a family of 6, so had two rooms and stayed 3 nights. We had problems of cards not working on the pool deck/lifts/restaurants (this automatically puts you…",3
Very cooperative and friendly hotel stuff The rooms are very big with sofa beds with excellent view The swimming pool is marvelous The hotel Location is great  I think the suit can accommodate 6 persons although the hotel limit it to 4 persons,5
"We held our wedding at MBS and it was a great experience. We had received a phone call 2 to 3 days prior to the wedding from the (Hotel check-in/operations) team. The team sincerely tried to accommodate some of our special requests (Like having a city view room). We are grateful to them for upgrading our Deluxe room to a suite that overlooks the city. Upon check in, the team even called to ensure if the room they had allocated was alright and congratulated us on our wedding. This team was also extremely professional by coming to our room and walking through the entire check-in process as well as check out process the next day. Overall, their service deserved an excellent and the room was great as well.",5
"A terribly over crowded pool, which was very unappealing the water looked slimy. So many tourists. Then because when we didn't tip the room cleaner, they stole our shopping which was 2 men's shirts we bought from Zara. We made a complaint about the noise from the lower ground Clubs and Bars on the first night ""that were partying all night - the sounds travels up the towers of the hotel. You simply can not ignore it. -  No sleep at all.""  The reception and concierge did not even care when we complained. They didn't move us to a less noisy location. No action was taken. We were very disappointed in our stay. The gym and the cocktail bar at the pool were the only positives about the experience.",1
"Amazing hotel, luxury rooms. Enjoying the views from the pool is a must (only allowed to hotel guests). Good food variety in the multiple restaurants. If possible, better to book a room with views to the front side where the city is, rather than the back side where the Gardens by the Bay is",4
"Wow what an enormous hotel. So beautiful. Great that it is attached to the Bayfront MRT station, so easy to arrive. The luggage storage process was very easy, the check-in process quick and we got a room before check-in time which was great. Every staff member was so attentive and friendly, especially the pool bar staff.   The room was so beautiful, loved the bath tub and the bathroom was massive! The bed was like sleeping in the clouds, it was so comfortable. The decor was very beautiful.  We had room service for breakfast and the food was amazing and still hot when delivered. There were so many restaurants to choose from otherwise, as its attached to the shopping centre, and the food court was pretty cheap too which was great.   We booked a gardens views room, and the view was…",5
"The view from the infinity pool at MBS is legendary and speaks for itself so I shan't spend time on this but instead focus on the service, which is always something that I am very particular about, as well as the room and amenities.  I have heard horror stories about the service at MBS, or perhaps the lack of it, be it from friends, online reviews or personal experience from a previous stay. Maybe I have been extremely lucky, but the service I've encountered throughout my 3 day 2 night stay this time round have been nothing short of excellent.   This starts right from the valet service, who took over my car with a smile and engaging in small talk to make us feel welcomed. To be fair, check in at MBS will always a nightmare due to their system, but we have been really lucky to be…",5
"Very Long check in lines. I don't know what took the receptionist that long to check people in! We were waiting for almost an hour until we got our room keys!   Not so much information about the membership that we could have got discounts on the museums and other purchases, so we have to go back again to get the memberhip because up to 50% discount on the museum entrances, got points for dinner, drinks etc. Could have told us to join immediately at the check in!   The rooms themselves was amazing, we were on the 49th floor harbor view rooms, and it was breathtaking at times, but next time we will choose city view as there's only blackness in the evening as there were almost no lights from the sea.   The pool lives up to the hype, it was an amazing experience! We loved it! It's…",3
"From the moment we arrived at the Marina Bay Sands it became clear that we had made a poor decision by staying here.  It started with a very long check in queue, finally when we made it though the check in process which took about 25 minutes.  The room type we booked was unavailable so we ended up with two rooms over looking the shops instead of the gardens.  When we got to our rooms they were small with no bath and ugly decor.  The hotel was absolutely over run with people, construction and noise!!!  The queue for for breakfast was ridiculous in each of the three restaurants with a very uninspiring spread.  The draw card of this hotel is only the pool which looked like human soup at best. The view was good but not at all appealing with hundreds and people an their selfie…",1
"Even though its big and busy and not my normal kind of hotel I absolutely loved bed out visit here! We had a club room with city view which was spacious,comfortably and had a stunning view. There were ample towels and more were provided in the evenings. Although it's a very busy hotel we found the staff to be very charming and attentive particularly in Club 55. The breakfast was amazing as was the cocktails and canapés at 5.00pm. The afternoon tea was good but we just found that it was too much to have that and then eat again at 5.00!  A special mention must be made to the lovely Rani who looked after us so well in Club 55 - thank you.",5
"It is clearly a thing to be seen. Inside and out, it truly is an amazing building. And surrounding it are some of the best attractions I've ever seen. The views from the top and of the hotel itself are second to none.  However, as a guest at the hotel, it didn't live up to what I wanted. It is very clean, the rooms are wonderful, and the staff are very good, but if you are not in the money leagues, you are ultimately just a number. The personal touch just isn't there. My check in was quick, but I saw the line was very long at other times, which is ridiculous. You have very little time to enjoy the pool, check in is 3pm if your lucky, check out at 11am. The pool is very busy. Amazing yes, but not relaxing. The lift system is slow and annoying to the top, 3 lifts, and the casino…",3
"My company make the reservation I always preferred another hotel but is was good to tried this one.  First it took me for ever to check in, and the staff was very rude like they don't even know what to do, I ask for extract pillow I have pain in my back and they tell me get to your room an call that's another department he can't even call.  The hotel is big and very nice but the staff is very bad for the price is not worth it. ",2
This hotel is awesome! Their infinity pool is one of a kind. Definitely a must-see. Thanks to Mr. Antonio (front desk agent) for being so helpful and accomodating.  Our room is clean but bathroom amenities are just average.  ,4
The Mini City...that's how Marina Bay Sands can be described!!! What doesn't it have...everything...views of the city...the garden by the bays...boat rides inside the mall...a pool that's worth being clicked in...the casino to help u try your luck....the elevators that zip up and down in seconds and a huge inventory of 2600 rooms!!!!!  So are the services slow and flappy considering the huge inventory????  No...definitely not!!! U name it and u get it - super quick.  Well now don't expect the personalized touch of Ritz but the staff at Marina is super quick & efficient.  A Singapore stay needs at least 1 night in this property!!!,4
"we are staying at grand club room which included the access to club55. the room is spacious, and they update the toiletries now into roberto cavalli branded which is better than the previous paiza branded one. The pool has become so crowded now you cannot enjoy a nice swim there but mostly people just go to the pool for a selfie at one of the best infinity pool ever.  As when we are there the Rise restaurant is under renovation, other breakfast venue is crowded and there is queue for breakfast.   Club55 served quite a good food for breakfast, and the service is impeccable.",5
"I've been to my fair share of luxury hotels around the world, and this is my first experience staying in a luxury hotel in my own country. I had to attend a conference at the convention centre, so I thought it would be fun to stay at the iconic MBS at least once.  I haven't given five stars because I reserve that for experiences that blew my mind. MBS is great, but nothing extraordinary - it gave me what I expected to receive at the price I was paying.   To start with, it was a little bit complicated getting there - I'm terrified of driving around in the city centre area, so I had studied and pored all the directions and maps the website had, but they weren't that specific (I guess that's not their fault - I'm a below average driver) so I still approached MBS with some…",4
"If you want to spoil yourself, then stay here for a night or 2. It is like a treat and you pay more for that. We stayed in Tower 3 with a room facing Gardens By the Bay; great size room with a balcony. I don't think the rooms facing the city have balconies. Lots of space to relax in for our last 2 days in Singapore. The Infinity pool is the drawcard here and it doesn't disappoint. There are 3 options for breakfast, 1 on the pool deck and 2 in the lobby. We ate at the pool deck and Adrift in the lobby for breakfast. Adrift has a much higher quality breakfast, the breakfast on the pool deck area was disappointing. You would come here just to try out the pool and to be able to watch the light show in the Gardens from your balcony. Up there as a great place to stay.",5
Beautiful hotel. Awesome room. But the wait in the lobby to check in to your room is absurd. Waited nearly an hour just to talk to the receptionist because of the queue. Others really good hotel. Food options for vegetarians is a little in the hotel restaurant. Although breakfast buffet has a lot of options.,5
"We went to Singapore for a wedding and it was my boyfriends birthday too, they made us an upgrade to a suite, the experience was incredible, the hotel it's marvelous, and  the attractions around it are excellent too. Garden by the Bay, ArtScience Museum, the Mall, the Flyer... and of course the infinity pop were incredible. ",5
I have been to Singapore about 4 times now and every time I am in Singapore I visit the Marina Bay and always enter the Marina Bay Sands. Everything here has been done in an Excellent Big Way.  It is awesome.  ,5
"What can i say! Booked this on a recent visit for myself and my brother as a thank you for him letting me stay with him.  From the minute we checked in to the minute we left nothing was too much.  Drinking mojitos at the infinity pool to ordering (very) late night snacks. A must visit for anyone who has the time to check in.   Different living at the highest point!! All the staff very friendly and helpful, no request is too much!",5
"amazing property and amazing services. check in line is long but its faster so its less waiting time and you get good place to wait for groups while check in. the infinity pool on roof top is the best pool i have ever been to. and the in room facilities, cleanliness, room service, bell man services,early check in, breakfast, shopping mall, dinner restaurants, celavi club, the light show in evening, connecting mrt station, location of the hotel....everything is just too good.",5
"Great location. A real 5 Star Hotel. Big but personal. Concierge was amazing. Room was perfect. Views over city from room were fantastic but it the other side you look over the amazing Sky Gardens so either way we would have been happy. Can walk everywhere but if you have a family it's great to hire bikes, electric scooters or seaways from across the water to view the whole area around Marina Bay Sands. Definitely worth the money. What you spend as a little extra here you save because you are so close to everything you need. Value for money if you can afford to come. Hire a super car from the lobby, eat amazing cakes, swim in the Skytop pool and enjoy the best view in town, go to the spa and overlook the tranquility of the Sky Gardens. So much to do if that's your type of…",5
Staying for one nite after discharge from hospital. Good hotel and we are relax. Only less about facility which still cant accept about refrigerator locked.  if we are open the refrigerator mean paid. So mean if we do not need content of refrigerator the room is not include refrigerator. But we need put some medicine (neopugen) which need cold place. Its mean high cost but less facility.,4
"Girls getaway in luxury. Couldn't of asked for a better experience from the moment we arrived, friendly porters, receptionists and housekeeping. Room was lovely and the pool was perfection. Best part of Singapore.",5
I stayed 1 night with my husband.  It's crowded but didn't bother me.  We got free upgrade for our honeymoon. I really appriciated they did such an effort.  One negative thing was the fact we had an insect in our room. But they sent up a team quickly to resolve. This hotel has great view. Of course the rooftop pool is the thing you should do. ,5
"This is the most iconic and overall best hotel on earth for me. It is a luxury hotel at reasonable price. I am so happy for the experience to stay at this hotel. The check in time was 3pm and the reception staff understand that we was tired and they check in us early at 10 am (free of charge) and to an upgraded room.they were very kind and helpfull.all the staff was smiley from the reception to the infinity pool.the room was very clean and smells good. The bathroom was also very clean.the view of our room was fantastic. Choose room with city view or skyview. There are 2 500 ml bottles of water every day. There was hairdrier,toothbrush,shampoo and conditioner,body lotion,shower gel,cottons,nails kit,pon pom.the infinity pool is the highest and best pool on earth. Amazing pictures…",5
"Upgraded to premier room with a fantastic view of the gardens by the bay. Excellent service, clean, spacious room. State of the art facilities. The pool is amazing, but it can get crowded. Like literally crowded! I highly suggest to take an early morning dip to fully enjoy the pool without the crowd. Best skyline view ever!   To infinity pool and beyond!",4
"We had a lovely stay here in May.  Geanna and Kelly at check-in were amaziing, upgrading us to a beautiful room on a high floor with an awesome view.  I felt sorry for their colleague checking in a family next to us that couldn't be pleased, no matter what room or upgrade they were offered.  They essentially wanted the presidential suite for the price of the lowest level room which they had booked.  My friend and I asked for nothing and were upgraded immediately...  The room and view from balcony were gorgeous.  The late night room service was delicious!  The true highlight of the hotel is the rooftop!!  From the pool to Spago Bar, I cannot say enough good things.  We had drinks and appetizers there every afternoon before dinner and loved it!  There were a ton of kids in the…",5
Excelent location and AmAzing view from the room and Infiniti pool . Costumer service very good The gym need more Machines but the view of your workout time one of the best i have been Highly recommended on your stay in singapore  At least one night for the best experience on a infinitivi pool,5
"Was so looking forward to our stay at the MBS, but was ultimately disappointed.  The hotel is beautiful, the views spectacular, and the staff ever-friendly all of which you'd expect from a top-ranked hotel.  What was lacking, though, was the attention to detail.  There were two problems with our room that we asked them to correct - TV remote didn't function properly and the shower drain was clogged - neither of which was remediated.  The ""up"" button on the remote did not work.  Not the end of the world, but not what you'd expect.  We asked that it be replaced, but it wasn't.  Should've been a simple fix.  The bigger issue was the shower drain.  It was clogged causing the water to build up and spill over into the bathroom beyond.  We remedied the first time by building a towel…",2
The hotel is truly a landmark unto itself in Singapore with its unique architecture and of course the guest only infinity pool that sits atop the 3 towers in a structure that resembles a boat.  The rooms are very well appointed and ours had an incredible view of the city and bay.  The hotel is conveniently connected to the tram system as well as the luxury mall that gives you every choice in luxury shopping you can think of.  The casino is also connected which we did not have the best experience at--(note there is no alcohol served at the casino).  We knew this hotel was a special treat and would cost more than others but glad we did.  The staff was all very friendly and helpful and the close proximity to the tram as well as other sightseeing made this a pleasurable experience…,5
"I've stayed at the Sands a few times in recent years, usually for conferences.  It's really a very good hotel, much as it maybe lacks the character and touches of a smaller operation.  But that probably shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, as it's massive.  And, really, as big as it is it's surprisingly well managed.  Pros:  -nice rooms.  Well-styled, great views and have everything you need.  -gym is very nice.  Again, fantastic view and very well-outfitted.  -the upper deck and pool areas really are extraordinary.  It's very crowded and so not exactly relaxing, but the pool and the views are worth seeing at least once.  It's especially nice to head up there early in the morning before it gets crowded.  Cons: -It's a big hotel and there's a corporate feel to it.  You don't…",4
"We booked a club deluxe room and filled in that the occupants would be 2 adults and 2 children. It didn't ask for our kids age. When we arrived we were told our children counted as adults (they are 16 and 13) and therefore we couldn't legally stay in the room we had booked. It was a deluxe room that included club entry, breakfast and cocktails on a high floor. Instead they found us a family suite, on the 2nd floor, no club extras, and it cost $140 extra. My husband was bummed and behaved like an infant, bitterly disappointed that he wasn't getting the luxury extras and wouldn't even go in the famous infinity pool.  I will not travel with him anymore. He can't roll with any punches. We were treated very nicely and professionally (He didn't speak with Aya at the desk- thank…",5
"Service: ++ Rooms: + Cleanliness: ++ Location: + Price: -/+ Wifi: ++  From checking in till checking out the whole experience is fantastic! My boyfriend and I stayed in the deluxe room with garden view and that was the best choice we made! The room is big and clean, with a tiny balcony where the view is great. At night you can enjoy the show of the Garden by the Bay. Which is fantastic. But of course the best part is the view from the rooftop on the infinity pool. It takes your breath away when sunset kicks in. Prices to eat there or even roomservice are less expensive then we expected. Expect the minibar, that's extremely expensive. Last but not least there service is top of the bill. Always ready to help with a friendly smile. We hope to stay hear again very soon. ",5
We planned to stay at Marina Bay Sands for two nights to celebrate my wife´s birthday. Communication before arrival was neat and I contacted the Hotel in order to ask them for a small welcome gift for her birthday. Two days later I received an answer that they would put a little present in the room and the person answering would take care personally. How this story ends... you´ll find out later.  Location: Exceptional location in Singapore right at the Bay with views to the CBD on the one side and Gardens by the Bay and the Sea on the other side. Easy to access by MRT or car and conveniently located for shopping and exploring the Bay area.   Hotel: The architecture is stunning and beautiful. A nice piece of architectural art with an impressive Lobby in which a rework is going on…,2
"The hotel felt quite new and clean. The bed was firm which was a big thing for me. Maybe it is the summer holidays, it was jam packed with people.   The wifi at the hotel was pretty poor. It kept disconnecting and I had to login several times a day.   The gym, unfortunately closes at 23:00 and that was very incovenient for people like me attending the trade show there. After the show and most likely client dinners, there were no time for exercise.   At night time, the lifts were incredibly slow. There were people going up to the pool, people going down to the lobby. It ususally took me 15 minutes to go from my room at Tower 3 to the gym at Tower 2. Until I found the express lifts next to tower 2 that noboby seemed to know about. It will take you straight from lobby to 55-57…",3
"We came yesrerday. It was such an awesome stay at Marina Bay Sands hotel. The room we got  is facing the side of Marina Shoppes whereby we have a spectacular view of the city, merlion park, esplanade and so on. Staffs are great. Very polite and accomodating. We love the infinity pool so much  as well as the spectacular view from the deck. What an amazing sight seeing experience on top of MBS. This is my 2nd time to be here in MBS, but i will always want to come back. 👍👍👍",5
"Well what can i say, the pool is AMAZING! honestly makes the experiance of staying at this hotel. The rooms i found were average and the hotel is so big you feel like your in a shopping mall. I would recommend this to anyone who visits singapore.",5
Really Marina Bay sands is an experience rather than simply a hotel.  We loved it as did our two kids.   The infinity pool on level 52 is clearly a highlight and was a great vibe  The restaurants as part of it were great especially Spaggo and Osteria Pizzeria in the Shoppes  The room we had was spacious and overlooked the City side. Each night we got to experience the light show put on by the hotel.   The room service was excellent quality.   Any query we had was so promptly attended to which made it such a easy enjoyable stay.   A good walk to the Gardens by the Bay to enjoy the light show there.  Loved the Sky deck too.   What a great experience!!!!,5
"We stayed one night in a 14th floor corner suite in tower 3. The room was excellent. Large balconies. Great views. Wonderful staff. Location is walking distance to many sight seeing locations. The pool is as good as it looks or better than the photos on the internet. The only problem is the size and design of the towers. If you are not in a good room location you have to constantly transfer lifts to get anywhere, everyone gets lost, and there are way too many people using the hotel amenities, restaurants and lobby area. Always too busy and noisy, long lines to get into the restaurants for breakfast, and the club lounge is a joke. Does not even have a lounge to relax in. Too many guests trying to use the club room at the same time. Food in the club room for afternoon tea and…",2
"Deliberately had a two night stopover here on our way to the Phillipines.  Love Singapore, the streets are well maintained.  Loved Marina Bay Sands, it's been on the bucket list for a couple of years, so figured why not stop on our way to our destination.  Great hotel, the infinity pool was very busy and drinks quite expensive, but hey why not, were on holidays!!",5
"Marina Bay Sands is an attraction in itself with sky park on 55th floor and the roof top swimming pool on 57th floor which give panoramic view of the entire city. Once you are dropped off at the hotel, the porters fetch your luggage, give you a receipt and show you the check in counter. The check in process was very organized however you should expect queues. The sky view deluxe suite provides an excellent view of the city. The room is spacious and very near and clean. You can get free access to sky park which is a must. The roof top swimming pool gives the best view of the city. You could be enjoying a cocktail by the edge of the pool enjoying the scene and spending hours. The pool is slightly congested though with mostly people taking pictures. Best time to go to the pool is…",5
"To be honest, this is one tough decision for me to make but I am going to put my opinion and experience down and you will be the one to decide if its worth it or not.   Marina Bay Sands definitely is one of if not THE most eye catching buildings in Singapore period. And it is a lot of travelers dream to visit this and not only just walking around but actually stay in this 5 star hotel. MBS have a 5 star hotel rating but the first thing it will definitely make you question it is the lobby area. One would assume that it would have their dedicated Check-in area but that is not the case, the lobby area is in the same area as everything else... and the check-in & check-out desk is one of the tiniest I have ever seen.   The check-in time is at 3pm and check out is at 11am. My…",4
it was best.iwas there with my family . totally singapore is so clean and beautiful but this hotel was so luxray and fantastic.rooms was so clean+beautiful+big+good wifi+such good place and view with nice balcony and it was so secure.,5
Our room was city view. The view is amazing during morning and even at night. The pool was a bit crowded even if it is raining. But overall experience was excellent. My 4 year daughter enjoyed swimming and does not want to go home.,5
"We were there a 3 guys for vacation it's a Breathtaking view , to watch the The ships unload goods at the port of Singapore, the food was perfect, the service really good, thw price a liytle bit expencive but it worth every penny",5
"Upon arriving at this hotel was greeted by a very ARROGANT women at check in desk who did not wanted to check us in, was told that our number has been called, never had such RUDE welcoming in a hotel, greeting desk was more like a DOCTOR SURGERY than a 5 star hotel, was checked in by her college who sat next to her, nice hotel but Shame about Arrogant check in staff & Attitudes, will not be using this hotel again.",3
"Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is a must. It is undoubtedly expensive, but the views,  especially from the pool are exquisite.  I stayed for a romantic weekend to celebrate my anniversary, and we stayed in a City View room. The room had amazing views of the marina and Singapore's financial district skyline. The rooms were large and comfortable. I would recommend a higher floor, as at nighttime the lower floors can be seen from walkways below.  I would recommend this hotel as a must try once. It is fantastic luxury.",5
Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever had the opportunity to stay in.   It is very pricey but if you can spend one night it is worth it.  The views from the 57th floor are amazing.  The sunset and sunrise from the top will take your breath away.  The infinity pool feels like you are on top of the world.  Fabulous at night and beautiful in the morning.  The hotel screams luxury.    BUT. If your budget does not allow one night ... make sure you go up to the observation deck.  The views are breathtaking.  It is definitely worth it :) ,5
It was absolutly ridiculous one of the worst staff I've ever experienced. The queue to check in took over an hour and the staff were rude and unhelpful and seemed to have no decided to provide any form of customer service. Extremely disappointing for the price we paid. Complete waste of money and time. ,1
"Great place, beautiful hotel. Service is ok and vey pricey. BIG shopping mall indie the hotel, but very expensive. Hotel is clean and roomy, cleaning lady is super nice. Foods were great but expensive. If you have the money to spend then it's worth it.",5
"Amazing,Outstanding,And Fantastic . Room was very nice with balcony with a fantastic Ocean view, love the interior of the room. Outstanding services of receptions girl. Check in was very impressive. Love the night view from 57th floor! Infinity pool is very crowded can't enjoy. Including room service all services are outstanding. Enjoyed rooftop restaurant with so romantic environment with candle light! Want to be there again and again.",5
Had a club room on level 47 overlooking the city with access to the club on level 57. Enjoyed our stay. The pool is a great experience although always crowded. Room was nice. Club facilities were okay although not as extensive as other clubs we have used. As a club member you only have benefits at specific times of the day ie you cannot drop in at any time & have a coffee - you need to pay.,4
"To me this is the only reason to visit Singapore.   The city is overpriced and there is nothing to do bar a few things here and there. Arriving at this hotel we were not disappointed. Rooms were HUGE, bathrooms incredible with a massive walk in shower.   Plenty of lifts for the whole hotel and staff by the pool where very friendly. Views were just incredible and funnily enough the alcohol and food was same price as ChinaTown so was happy there. To get access to the pool you need your key card which was great, meant it was quiet and not overcrowded with plenty of beds spare. THE VIEW was worth every penny! main pool was adult only and heavily enforced. Childs pool was next door with same views but was nice to get away.  Few little niggles...  For the price you pay per night would…",4
"Fantastic!!  The only sad part was having no breakfast included with the price of the room. We had 3 of us girls sharing a room, had a great view of the city from a high level floor.  The infinity pool is amazing, we layed there nearly all day with amazing Pina Coladas served in a coconut.  Be prepared for a long queue to check in. Service is friendly, decor is stunning inside.  Definitely a must do at least once in your life!",5
Floor owner was so kind and his room cleaning was also good. Infinity pool was good. But braekfast at the restaurant next to infinity pool needs to be improved more and it was inconvenient to use that restaurant.,4
"Great for what i have experienced here. The rooms have beautiful views, nice pool and very clean, service is perfect, comfortable, courteous and professional, im really satisfied and really want to come back here again in the future. Loved my trip included the hotel i stayed...",5
Of course it's all about the pool ! The sole reason we booked the Marina Bay Sands was because of that incredible pool and it really is as amazing as it looks the pictures. We secured the coveted in pool lounges to watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand ..... truly beautiful !Yes the pool deck is busy.... crazy busy... but it was a fun relaxed atmosphere and the service was really great.  Check in was fast and smooth despite there being lots and lots of people in the lobby. Staff walking around with bottled water was a really nice touch. We had three rooms on the 44 th floor and they were fantastic . Amazing views over the Super Grove trees and out over the water. The rooms were incredibly spacious and the bathrooms were huge ! Gorgeous freestanding bath and an enormous …,5
Marina bay sands is a HUGE hotel with a mall and amazing infinity pool.  It has 57 floors and great views. We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights. There is a walkway to gardens by the bay from In the hotel. It even has a a MRT tram station.  The infinity pool has great views of Singapore and you can see as far Malaysia  If you look closely. We stayed on the 2nd floor. The room was cleaned at least once a day. The cleaners mad a little towel animal every day for us as well. Our stay was great. Thank you :) ,5
"Stayed on the 7th February for one night while backpacking SE Asia. It had always been on my bucket list to visit the infinity pool therefore I forked out the expensive (but well worthy rate) to stay here. Stayed at the infinity pool from 1pm to 10pm, absolutely SURREAL. I'd recommend this to absolutely anyone. I don't regret anything about my trip. views are amazing and such kind staff members! Free wifi, towels and snack bar at the pool was fairly good prices!",5
"We had three nights at MBS.  We decided to indulge and had a King Club Suite.  Be prepared that this is a massive hotel with three big towers.  It is a small city unto itself.  There are lots of people about at all times of the day - literally.  The bars, restaurants and pool have people from opening to closing. Chances are you will queue for most things at some stage and like many attractions elsewhere in Singapore- they will be crowded.  Having said that, they seem to be efficient and you never seem to wait as long as you might think.  Our suite was magnificent.  We had a beautiful view of the Gardens.  The room and bathroom were scrupulously clean and maintained.  All of the staff we dealt with were professional, helpful and courteous and all times.  The club55 lounge…",5
This is definitely a place you have to visit when in Singapore.....  what an experience.   What a hotel.   What a view..... phew.  Stunning,5
"Very nice hotel! Huuggeee!! The rooms are nice, very spacious, with a nice bed and a great bathroom. Countless restaurants, with a huge variety of food, but if you want to eat something after party, late at night, you will not find. The best part of the hotel, in my opinion is the swimming pool, with its great view! It is not easy to find a chair by the pool, but if you are patient and get there early you will be able to do it. Another great thing about this hotel is that you can get there by subway! You take subway at the airport and you will hop off it inside the hotel! Awsome! I consider this hotel an attraction of SIngapore, and it worth, at least, the visit for some pics.",4
"Just went there to spend the day, to experiance what the hype was all about and it is all very real.I was really excited to go there because UFC fight night was taking place and all the fighters were staying there,sadly didnt get to see anyone but really got to walk around check the shopping and the pool.",5
One of the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed in. We were upgraded and stayed on the 48th floor and had the most beautiful view of the city. The food was exceptional. The service was unbelievable and the pool was the best I have ever stayed in with beds in the water. Every aspect of our stay was perfection.,5
Very nice place to visit. Casino is quite nice. Shop is good. Mrt just a minute walk. Taxi so many. Will be back to mbs again. The problem is all expensive shop so nees to get money from casink to shop...hahahaha,4
"It’s everything you’d expect: classy, expensive, and sophisticated.   I totally enjoyed the room, it was tastefully decorated and comfy. Special rate via booking through travel agent in advance start from 13,000++ Thai Bath or around 333 Euro per night.  The room was very neat with the view of panoramic Singapore, included 2 bathrooms with a telephone inside each, the king sized bed was comfy, and Internet Wifi was very fast. I loved how the curtains open up automatically when you first walk into the room. The views from the infinity pool are amazing. I heard that if you're not a guest at the hotel, gotta pay extra $20 or THB 500 or 13 Euro to get to the pool area.  It's worth for one-time experience.",5
"We booked the Club Room as a 1 night staycation to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  There were some really nice experiences at the hotel: 1. The room was really spacious and as we had a Bay View, we were not disappointed. There is no other view quite like the one we had. 2. The room was clean and had nice amenities. 3. Most of the staff were nice and friendly. Jonathon at the Sands Lounge check-in was really lovely. He gave us a later check out at 1pm. 4. We were given a complimentary cake for the anniversary. Thank you.  We expected these to be better in view of the 5 star status, and Club Room price and booking: 1. We had to pay for valet car park. Other hotels in Singapore would have waived this. 2. Emails from the reservation department pre-check in were perceptively…",3
"We stayed for 1 night in July in an Orchid Suite with city views.  We had priority check in which was a nice touch.  The room was very spacious, but felt almost under furnished.  We had breakfast included which could be taken in our room.  We also had access to level 55, the evening canapés and beverages included were beyond our expectations.    The pool.... while it is obviously the most amazing location for a pool, it was so packed, it really made the experience less than desirable.   We ate at Adrift and also Gordon Ramsay's Bread Kitchen, Bread Kitchen was superior.    I loved the location, which was a short stroll to the Gardens By the Bay and also Satay By the Bay.",4
"Disappointed with the rude staff at the pool gantry. We wanted to visit the restaurant Spago but entered the wrong tower and ended up at the pool entrance. We only hv one access card at that moment and asked if we can enter to go to Spago so that we do not need to take the lift from tower 1 level 57 to level 1 and move on to tower 2 to take the lift back to level 57. And i told her we were not dressed for the pool n thus not entering to use the pool so not to worry.  I informed the lady that my other key was left in the room and she shouted rudely that i am ""not supposed"" to leave my card key in the room. I told her my kiddy is in the room that is why i left it there.  Such rude service from a 6 star hotel.  P.S we were so angry that we decided not to visit Spago. ",1
"Everything about our stay at Marina Bay Sands was amazing. We got to the hotel 2 hours  before standard check in time, the queue was large but we were offered free ice cream whilist we waited! Once at the front of the queue we managed to check in early and got late check out free of charge! Room was very spacious, views were amazing over gardens by the bay! Pool area was excellent, we visited it around 9pm in the evening and around 7am in the morning and was reasonably quiet, plenty of loungers available. Hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and always someone available. Couldn't fault it! Expensive but worth every penny!",5
"Beautiful hotel, nice clean comfortable room with good views, we are lucky to have a balcony with garden view on the high floor, hotel staff very accommodating, pool has a fantastic view. Really enjoyed our stay here. Expensive but worth it.",4
"In fact, it is a very expensive hotel. But trust me on this, it worth it! Despite the huge size and number of rooms, they treat you in a very special way, making you feeling like one of the few guests",5
"""Speechless"" is the perfect word for this hotel. Rooms are big, clean and with a great view on the harbor and the gardens. The swimming pool is magic and let people see Singapore from a different landscape with its fairy sunsets!  Hope to come soon again!!",5
"Go for the club rooms or suites to enjoy the amazing lounge. The food is to die for and the view of the city impressive. Do not miss the rooftop infinity pool.  we stayed in a club room with two children. Very good beds, bathroom with all expected amenities and sofa bed sleeping two kids comfortably.",4
"We booked a club room on the day of my son's birthday. They arranged for a complimentary cake to be delivered to our room and also offered a cake and happy birthday singing in the club lounge, which we did not expect. It was all very tasty and very touching. The food in the club is amazing and with sufficient variety to please everyone. The club room is very good, spacious fitting a family of parents and two children. The hotel is just gorgeous with the roof infinity pool being an attraction by itself. The staff is dedicated, polite and friendly. The only two real issues keeping me from giving a full 5 points are: the noisy and busy entrance hall (booking club privileges allows you to check in/out in a separate lounge) and the structural lack of sufficient elevators making it a…",4
"Recommended for the infinity pool of course, that offers impressive views of the skyline. The deluxe king room was clean and huge. I appreciates the prompt services. However, it gets crowded both at the pool as well as at the sky bar and elevators. For a one time stay is worth the money.",4
"So I got done with my 5th stay at MBS last month and it wasn't great by any stretch.  I don't stay there by choice, more of a company decision.  I would pick the St Regis, Westin or Ritz over MBS any day. The hotel is chock full of tourists that want to do their standard infinity pool photoshoot.  If that's a must for you then I guess you're stuck.     1) check-in is a standard 25-30 min process.  Unless you're a casino VIP with several other check in options  2) Bell staff need to learn about deodorant.  Singapore is hot, you get sweaty. Cramped in an elevator, it's really quite nasty.  3) Rooms furnishings and amenities are more 3 star quality.  This hotel really doesn't feel current. Feels like something from the 90s.  4) The same type rooms are also different by tower and by…",2
"If you have a desire to stay in a hotel that feels like a busy airport terminal the Marina Bay Sands is for you.  Forget the impressive external architecture and engineering .... it is without soul.  Whilst the room views are nice, for the money the rooms are average with poor service and no turn down service.  The impressive roof pools are impressive, but so crowded that we decided to give them a miss.  The sun lounges are only about 12 inches apart ... not a pleasant experience.  Of course at that height, the pool is windy to boot.  As for the shopping malls which have more designer shops available than any other hotel .... they are way over price and of course empty.  We recommend staying elsewhere and make a day visit.  We will never darken the MBS doors again.",2
"This hotel is one of a kind. It's design is amazing. If you are not afraid of heights go to the restaurant or into the pool. Views are spectacular. It is expensive but if you can afford just one night, then it is a must do. The venetian gondalas inside the hotel are a great touch of individuality. ",5
"The MBS is heaven, literally. The most i love like the others is the infinity pool on the top! Room is good and we have garden view which is superb! Overall, you should stay for at least 1 night at MBS !its worth it! ",5
"We recently spent 1 night at the MBS during a stopover in Singapore.  As a 5-star hotel experience, it lacked in nearly every aspect.    The check-in was impersonal and fairly inefficient.  We were given few helpful instructions, beyond where to find the elevator.  We told them we were there celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, and were ""upgraded"" to a slightly larger room than we originally booked-but received no other acknowledgement (after 2 weeks of vacationing from Hong Kong to Thailand we were treated exceptionally by other 5-star hotels along the way with flowers, champagne, chocolate--and more).  The room was right next to the elevators and the interior was in need of renovating.  The carpet was absolutely horrific with stains upon stains, along with previous…",2
"Stayed in a Grand Club King Room with City View. The room is massive (not just bedroom but bathroom and separate wardrobe/dressing space) and the view was great. The real star of the show though is obviously the infinity pool. Definitely the highlight of the stay.  The overall experience (not taking into account the pool and skypark) probably isn't worth the money - we stayed at a much nicer hotel for the few nights before MBS with nicer room/amenities and better service from staff for half the price - but the skypark is just a bucket list experience and saves the day.  I must say, the check-in/check-out experience leaves a bit to be desired given the money paid for the room. Having to check in at the Sands Lounge in Tower 1, then to be given a room in Tower 3 at the opposite…",5
"This hotel is great. We got 25 th floor and we have hood view. Balcony has the view of garden by the bay. The swimming pool is huge but not very deep. You see a lot of people taking photo instead of swimming. Hot tub is good size, sky park or observation deck is spectacular. If you have a chance, stay in this hotel, its expensive but worth it.",5
"Singapore is incomplete without living here. Make sure to take this hotel, even if just for a day. The views are amazing and so is the pool. We took a garden view room which had breathtaking views from the 57th floor. This hotel lives up to the hype, thanks to its iconic views and massiveness. the rooms are non smoking. there is a smoking zone on the top floor next to the pool. the club on the 57th floor is amazing to party, music is groovy. dont miss on this.its a life time experience to live.",5
"There is no doubt that the Marina Bay Sands is a world class hotel with world class staff, services and features. The building itself is stunning. The rooms we had (for us and some guests) were exceptional, as was the care and attention we received from all staff.    However, for our tastes, it is just too damn big and too damn crowded! The magnificent infinity pool on the roof of the three towers is crowded all day. There are often queues (albeit not too lengthy) for breakfast at some restaurants. There are crowds of people in the lobbies at all hours and the lifts are often 'chockers', often with people in their wet swimsuits.  But the singular thing that bugged us the most was children in bars.  Pay a little extra for your accommodation and you can have cocktails and canapes…",3
"My fiancé and I decided to stay here for a night during a trip to Singapore as a treat for our last night and we were certainly not disappointed. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt like royalty. The lady who checked us into the hotel went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and even moved our room to face Gardens by the Bay. We stayed in the Premiere King Room on the 36th floor and could not fault the room, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was huge with a luxury bath, shower and double vanities. The amenities on site were also wonderful, the infinity pool has a view to die for, the hotel is connected to the casino and shopping centre and its a short walk over to see the light and water show. Overall our experience was fantastic and we would…",5
"One of the most attractive place in Singapore is bay sands marina hotel area, it has all attractive things around like singapore flyer, garders by the bay and the bay sands deck and the laser show everything is awesome. prepare to walk a lot and have some 4-5 hrs minimum time starting from 4pm till 9pm. Hats off to singapore for creating such great place",5
It's an absolutely stunning hotel. Has a few great restaurants. The huge pool on the roof is a must visit esp at night. Not cheap but still value for money. Fantastic staff. A friend forgot his phone in taxi and the staff went out of their way to help him get it back,5
"Stayed here for 3 nights in Tower 2 on the 42nd floor with a city view and club lounge access. Unless you've booked a suite or room with lounge access, checking in looked akin to economy class check-in for a long haul flight - very long winding queues. My check-in was in a dedicated lounge with refreshments and took just a few minutes although I was then left to find my own way to the correct elevator / tower / floor combination which is a good walk among the mass of people on the ground floor.  Once away from the hassle of check-in and the ground floor, you can really enjoy this place.  Even though it's only 7 yrs old all the rooms have or are in the process of being renovated.  My room was lovely with a fantastic view over the CBD and marina bay.  The club lounge serves…",4
We are family of four (two boys 8 and 10 years old). We wanted to have the hotel with the view for adults and the pool for kids. I think that we could not choose better! We had the room with City view (on the 44th floor) and I think that nothing can beat it! The rooms are large (we had one for our family) and the infinity pool is just stunning.,5
"if you are visiting Singapore , a night stay at Marina Bay Sands is must. three Big towers joined on the top by infinity pool will make you forget everything. more than 1500 rooms property, still they will take care of each and everything of you.  Infinity pool will give you a view that you will never forget. Cela-vi club is one of the most happening club of the town and you will get best drinks with best music, connected with Shoppes at Marina, you can do lots of shopping and there are multiple food joints.",5
"the hotel room itself and the staff were amazing, but the number of people and their children definitely ruined this experience. am looking forward to seeing this paid off my credit card and never to be thought of again.",3
"I travelled here with my family for a total of 5 nights and the first thing i enjoyed as i walked in was the liveliness of the hotel itself. The fact that the hotel is connected to a mall-type area separates this hotel from others as it is constantly filled with life and busyness- but not busy enough to put you off. Check in took longer than expected but we were soon taken to our rooms- very spacious and a seemingly normal ensuite and room. Obviously the main attraction of this hotel is the infinity pool which defiantly lived up to our expectations. I was slightly worried it would be busy and crowded, as most attractions are, however the large length of the pool and guest-only rules made sure it was relaxing and spacious. There was a slight issue for a couple of nights with the…",4
"Singapore is fantastic place i been twice and want back,the hotel is great ,pool is place where you must to bee ,is fantastic view to the city,trees and coffee near pool is super.I didńt like hotel lobby too many people in the hall,stuff is very helpful,rooms are clean and comfortable.",4
"So this one lived up to the hype: fantastic staff, great room, many options when it came to eating (both within the hotel and in the adjacent Mall), fantastic views from the top (but book a table if you want a guaranteed spot to sit - very busy up there around sunset). They have a really good little coffee shop at the base of Tower 3, great snacks. Location is great and within walking distance to some of the most amazing attractions.  Beware thinking you can call a cab/Uber and they come pick you up at the entrance...access to the main drop-off/pick-up point from the street is chaotic at best and it can take 20 minutes longer for the cab just to turn into the property.  Great place to stay, highly recommended.",5
"We stayed here as family over the weekend for a staycation.   The positives are  1- Phenomenal views of the beautiful city  2 - Great size rooms. We were on the club floor and the room was perfect for two adults and two kids under 12.  3 - The club lounge is well laid out and once again a great place to enjoy some great views.  4 - Service standards were very high with great effort being made by all staff.  5 -part of a great complex and tons of activity for the family.  The negative are:  1 - Just too crowded. With 98 % occupancy and 2490 rooms, there are people just everywhere. There are queues for breakfast, queues for lifts, queues for evening cocktails and packs of people on the roof top .  2 - The pool is once again a marvel - but ...you guessed it....crowded at al times -…",4

"The service was truly fantastic. From the minute we got there one staff member paid for the cab himself as we didnt have cash on us and the cab driver wouldnt take card.  We paid him back of course but it was nice to not have to run and find an atm after an 11 hour flight.  Then Joseph who checked us in was so wonderful and offered us a free room upgrade and gave our children ice cream. He also was so kind and organised a late checkout.  room service was great, staff were attentive to our little ones and were always smiling.  The rooftop pool has a great view of the city.  the deck does get slippery so you need to take care with little children especially.  staff were very helpful.  The hotel is located right next to the shoppes which was perfect for us.  The rooms were clean…",4
"I booked a room at MBS for my parents who are visiting Singapore for the first time and are celebrating their wedding anniversary!  From the very beginning when we stepped in the hotel we already felt like royalty.  We were moving to the check in counter when a lady (did not catch her name) approached us and asked to follow her for check in, we were very surprised when she led us the VIP check as the counter there was free!  Ivan from VIP counter was very helpful and upgraded us to a room on a very high floor as this is a special occasion for my parents!  Hotel staff also prepared some special amenities for my parents (coffee cake and towel swans with rose petals). I really wished that this hotel stay will be very special and memorable for them and it really was! They will…",5
"One word to describe this hotel is Awesome!!!!. My husband and I arrived at the hotel about 2 hours before our scheduled check-in and was greeted with great professionalism from the minute we arrived. We had a Grand club room, in a beautiful suite on the 53rd floor (Tower 3). We had access to Club 55, where we were once again treated with such warmth and attentive service. Our room overlooked  the gardens/harbor which was beyond beautiful. In Club 55 you also have an afternoon tea (wide range of canapes, fruits, desserts, cold cuts and an assortment of cheeses). Club guests are also treated to cocktails later in the evening. The suite was beyond amazing!!, with remote drawn drapes and even the toiletries ( by Roberto Cavalli) completed the luxurious details that you would expect…",5
"good property , excellent service, remarkable property to visit atleast once in life time   it has an excellent ambience , casino , shopping complex and an infinity pool at the roof   top . A scenic beauty to view singapore from infinity pool",4
"I booked harbor view I thought it will be Singapore river/bay , then i saw the gardens+ the harbor. When I asked the front desk they told me they called river/bay view "" city view "" i told them normally city view name  mean the worst view because no special things to mention actually the perfect & fabulous view the city view, I suggested to front desk employee to change the "" city view "" to "" bay or river view "". ",5
"Expectations were exceeded at this hotel!  Room was amazing, spacious and had a spectacular view of Gardens by the Bay. Great walking distance to key landmarks e.g Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, and Merlion Park. Infinity pool overlooking city was a must do experience.   Would 100% visit again! ",5
"Marina Bay Sands, a relatively new addition to the list of luxury hotels in Singapore, is simply amazing for its location in the Marina area, spectacular views, size of facilities, about 2500 rooms in three towers in a 57 storied building with swimming pool at the 57th floor. Sheer size makes it rather crowded, whether it is checking or checkout, or the restaurant or the pool, and even elevators, one has to queue and wait.",5
"We picked Marina Bay Sand because we saw good reviews about the hotel and its amenities, as soon as we walked into the Infinity Pool, we were attracted by the awesome city view and the direct view to Garden by the Bay, but kind of disappointed about the Pool,  it looked like a giant 'bath tub' everybody 'marked' their space  by extending their arms along side the latch of the Pool. The hotel lobby is huge but not much 'warmth and welcoming' decors. Room services was great, we found towel animals in our room on our first day arrival, and everyday they added additional towels animals to our room. Believe this hotel is rated 6 Stars because it has a casino within the Bldg. Nice shopping, eating and gambling place. The best view to see or take pics of Marina Bay Sands was actually…",4
"  We stayed one night as we had heard about the infinity pool and the only way we could use it or even see it was as a hotel guest. We moved there from the Mandarin Oriental and all I can say about it is the view from the room looked over the city and the Museum was amazing,floor to ceiling glass on the 30th floor afforded us a great view of the light show in the evening. The location was very good especially for the Gardens in the Bay which were a short walk away. The beds were comfortable and the en suite a decent size. No bath though for any bath lovers out there.  The negatives:  pool area was packed no sun loungers free! The plus was the view if you don't mind cold water. Customer service in general very poor especially in comparison to the Mandarin Oriental. Our flight was…",3
"If you're looking for a great architecture and a nice city view, then this is the place to go. The view is spectacular especially at night. We watched the light show here in the bay and I'm amazed with it. Just note that there are a lot of tourist who watch it so be sure to go an hour early before the show to have the best seat in the park.",5
"The magnificent view when you're staying in 46th floor made it so worth it. From sunrise to sunset overlooking the marina bay and gardens by the bay is just spectacular. I loved the jacuzzi and pool as well! Cant say a lot about service, it wasn't so bad but it can be improved.",4
"This place is the hotel of hotels in Singapore. Literally is a complex. From the mionute you walk in you are taken back! The sheer size of the place and the amount of people working there is unreal. Despite how busy it was check in was so fast. We had the Club Room (4170) and it was amazing. Comfy beds, huge bathroom, brilliant views, club lounge access etc. As with everyone we spent most of the day at the infinity pool which is always super busy so you need to wait and be quick to get a bed once it gets vacated. OVerall this hotel was brilliant and will be my ONLY choice when going back to Singapore.",5
This hotel is the best in Singapore.. We had a great time .. the casino is something we loved (new thing for us to explore).. the pool is just amazing and the skylark is the highlight of this hotel... ,5
"What a view!! so peaceful, beautiful and relaxing. As per me, this place has one of the best sunset view. Must must visit place. I had a Singapore Sling with some hot dogs, both were awesome. Singapore Sling is a drink that originated from Singapore by Raffles, in some 1800s. This drink is primarily made from gin & has a very subtle Suroor. A must try drink.",5
"We had room situated in upper most levels. Room had Club Lounge benefits (Club 55). Lounge was nice with beautiful views. Lounge's offer in foods and snacks were not the best, but very good. The receptionist of Lounge remembered our name after first visit, so that was impressive. Our room was spacious with simple decoration. I would say quite basic room with the design. I give 5 stars because of rooftop pool and all amenities around hotel (shops, restaurants, bars, staff). Although room was simple we did not have any problems. We even got 2 hours extra with check-out. I think one or two nights at this hotel is enough if you are looking at the price.",5
Wow what a place service was amazing rooms were easy to book on line communication via email was perfect - loved every bit of our stay - even if it was a little expensive worth every $. The gardens by the bay a night where spectacular.  However didnt realise till the day when were leaving the walkway thru the hotel takes you there. We never asked how to get there but reckon it would be even better from the ground looking up.  ,5
Highly would recommend staying here! Although it is expensive you get what you pay for. The rooftop pool is 10/10. Stunning views of the city. Highly recommend staying here if not for the rooftop pool alone.,5
"Stayed in MBS for 1 night with parents, wife and kid. Took two rooms on  24 to 25th may. Got one room city facing other one garden by bay facing. Everything was just picture perfect. Especially the infinity pool. You will get access to infinity pool only if you stay there. Good part is check in check out was real first inspite of very rush. My kid enjoyed a lot in this very short stay",5
The view is clearly amazing the experience having a room is not great. Service is poor you are just a number / a mojito is 25€ so enjoy it \. Don't forget your card to go to the pool otherwise they tell you to go back to your room with no smile like you disturbing so enjoy and wait again to elevators and after 20 min you may enjoy the pool / don't think you will get a seat as it's packt . Room is ok no woaou but the view is great !  Staff look depressed by the number of people for sure the work at the reception didn't help.in the queue they ask you what kind of room you booked in case you book a premium room if not you can wait and queue doesn't looking great next to your girlfriend.,1
"Spent 2 nights here recently. Got an upgrade with a nice view. Large room little tired around the edges and a below average shower nozzle.Highlight was the infinity pool but needed your card and going through turnstiles to get there was a turnoff. The pool was packed and very warm.one of our travellers got a raging ear infection. The food was only average, breakfast disappointing variety but service was good. I found it huge and impersonal.The interior is impressive but the rainbow pattern front desk was bizarre. Very expensive and not that impressive.",3
"Rooms are spacious, but not luxurious. For the amount you pay, the room was nothing special. a bit overpriced but  views of Gardens by the bay and Singapore flyer  were amazing..Overall good experience.",3
"I was warned not to go to Sg in the summer. But luck's in my favour. Not only is it a cool 22 deg C its breezy too. The on and off showers make it cooler.  Marina Bay Sands rocks !!! The staff and front office guys are awesome and cooperative. Upgraded to 2 club rooms and they had to bear with with us till we were comfortable. They checked us in at 11 am compared to the usual 3pm. Its just my first day and I truly love this hotel, the views are to die for. 5 stars and 3 cheers ! Keep it up !!!",5
"We stayed two nights here as part of our honeymoon.  The check in and hotel lobby was very underwhelming. We had a long wait in what felt like a shopping centre. It's not very well organised. We checked in and got a complimentary upgrade. However on check in we're told we had to pay to have our fridge/mini bar kept open and if we didn't pay a bond they would lock the fridge meaning we couldnt store or keep bottled water cold.  The room was nice and big and clean, however still underwhelming for an upgraded room. We were on the 36th floor, so the views made up for it.  By far the main attraction to this hotel is the rooftop infinity pool which is amazing. The views are incredible, however it can become busy with family's late in the afternoon.   There are plenty of shops,…",3
"We were spoiled from start to finish on our 2 day stay. We were on honeymoon and received a room upgrade which allowed us to enjoy the views of the gardens from the 51st floor. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the room was just amazing. The rooftop pool is the main attraction of the hotel and well worth it's status. It's amazing to watch the sun rise from the infinity pool that boasts the best views of the city!   We enjoyed exploring the hotel which has a great gym, has plenty of options to eat (including in the shopping mall next door)   Would definitely recommend spending a night there on your next trip to Singapore!",5
"My partner and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a night a few days ago. cindy and her team went above and beyond the call of duty to insure we had a wonderful experience during our short stay. We were treated very nicely, and had prompt service from start to finish. We had a wonderful view of the city and of course the pool is to die for! Will stay here again in the future. ",5
"I have travelled the world and never have I checked out of a hotel with such a bad taste being left in my mouth. As a frequent user of hotels I would say my tolerance level for mishaps & errors is high. I held off posting this review as I wanted to give MBS every opportunity to come to a reasonable solution. It has not been forthcoming.  So......  Singapore, what a fantastic city, economic example to the rest of the world, and where I was to spend the last 2 days of my travelling South East Asia for 3 weeks. All completely overshadowed and ruined by staying at the MBS hotel. I'll cut to the chase, SGD$1600 for a moderate amount of non-special item laundry, not even half a suitcase. A completely obscene amount (£1000 / US$1200 in case you thought you had mis-read) which I felt…",1
"A stay at this hotel was on my bucket list so the last night of our stay in Singapore was spent here at great cost I may add. What a complete let down. The pool is the obvious attraction at MBS. However the pool areas, while divided into adult and children are difficult to police. The spa was tiny but beautifully hot. The pool water was cold and most people just hoped in long enough for the obligatory selfie. The rest of the hotel is a vast void. Check in was fine,the  room was fine but not luxurious. The bathroom products were just fine, not overly generous supply.  Our room had excellent city views. We found that we had to visit the shops to eat. Breakfast at Spago was fine.  I am just so disappointed that a hotel that I had on my wish list was so meh. It was expensive for all…",2
"Stunning piece of architecture and an engineering wonder (check out the documentaries about this place on youtube). Staff are the best ... as would be expected at over AUD600 a night, but was a smidge annoyed that a fridge in the room cost extra. We were on the 42nd floor overlooking Merlion Park in a King Room... more the size of a small apartment :) Across the road is an excellent food court with reasonable prices. Recommend to go online and join the Marina Bay Sands loyalty program before arriving as it offers some excellent savings, even at the free card level. The infinity pool on the roof is simply AWESOME!!!",5
"Wonderful place to be for the view on singapore. Absolutely not cheap yet worth visiting if you are around there. The view from the pool is amazing, as well as the club on the top. Heavily recommended ",5
"Has always been on my bucket list. This hotel is a wonder of the modern world. From the moment you enter the property there are friendly and accommodating staff waiting to greet and help you. The room was very comfortable and spacious, with all the mod cons available. Ordered room service on a number of occasions whilst there and found both the quality and selection of dishes excellent.   Then we come to the pool... absolutely amazing!!! The only issue is that it gets busy very quickly would suggest get there early and then enjoy breakfast in one of the 2 restaurants with stunning views. ",5
The staff there welcome and help us when we were there for the NDP!!! The food served was carefully made and the pool's view was magnificent!!! It indeed is a must see and go to!!! Good for your holidays to see fireworks during National Day parade !!!,5
We stayed here for 2 days after disembarking a cruise. The hotel is located very close to the cruise terminal and is just a short cab ride away. We booked late checkout at 6pm which is charged at half the daily room rate. The hotel has resort facilities spanning the three towers above and features an edge pool with bars and restaurants which is quite amazing. Shops and restaurants are all easily accessible as is the Singapore MTR which enables quick and efficient train travel around Singapore. A passport is required to visit the casino. The food court in the shopping centre features a large street food court area with various Singapore cuisines at reasonable prices. There is a lot to choose from. We stayed in a room facing the marina and the city. The light and water show st 8pm…,5
"We stayed here for our honeymoon, just one night, since it is very pricey. We mostly stayed here to enjoy the pool view and the gym view, if this is worth it to you DO stay, if not, I would not recommended it, the treatment feels massive, not personalized, we never felt like we were stating at a high end resort as we did in every single hotel independently from the star rating, every one made us feel at home. Here, no one had that 1:1 personalized treatment or even congratulated us. We did it as a bucket list thing to do, would never come back! Not worth the money, stay somewhere where you can be treated as you deserve and get more bang for your buck! ",3
"A hotel that is so big it seems like a city in itself. With its own train stop, it is handy to get to other areas in Singapore. High end yes, but tucked in the lower floor is the best fastfoods in all of Singapore. (Voted by us after being all around Singapore countless of times.) We were given a room with the best view ever of the light show from the Gardens by the bay. That we really enjoyed! The staff were all friendly and helpful. Oh and did I forget to mention the rooftop pool? That was such a pleasant relaxing experience. Just make sure you go not on peak hours so there's not a lot of people. Overall value for money.",5
"The reception area has the charm and soul of the aircraft hanger it appears to be modelled on. On a previous visit it took 30 minutes to check in using the ""VIP check-in service"", and standards haven't improved since. MBS is a stain on the reputation of Singapore's otherwise excellent hotel industry. Avoid, avoid, avoid",1
We stay here for 3nights. My stay here was really excellent. We avail the transportation from the hotel which is very convenient. Upon arrival at the hotel we were assisted by the staff with their beautiful smile and expressed check in. We also love their infinity pool. It was an amazing excellent experience.,5
The lookout s on the 57th floor and the view is magnificent. You can see 360 degree views of Singapore and on a clear day Indonesia. I could not see Malaysia as there were some buildings in the way. We could see the pool on the 58th floor but could not access it. The pool is amazing however got lots of photos of the lucky people swimming there. We had a drink in the deck bar and just took in the views. Well worth going up. There was a small fee to get there but well worth the money. The hotel itself I though was just too big. I believe there is accommodation for some 4000 guests. ,5
"Second visit to the Marina bay sands hotel. First time amazing no problems at all. This time we stayed for 7 days, and on 3 occasions our key card did not work. so new cards had to be provided. Had to ask for compensation, they provided a 100.00 credit to use at the hotel. the adult only section of the pool and spa, was not controlled by staff. Children were always using the spa, in particular, so frustrating for us adult. recommend for 2 days only",4
"Stunning hotel with every amenity you can think of including a rooftop inifinity pool that overlooks Marina Bay and downtown Singapore! The beautiful Gardens By The Bay are connected to the hotel and the Singapore Flyer is within walking distance. A shopping mall, casino, and public transit are all connected to the hotel. For the best night in Singapore, this is the place.",5
"Had a good stay at the Marina Bay Sands. We stayed here for a night mostly to stay at this iconic hotel and to swim in the infinity pool   Our room: the rooms are distinctly average.  The decor is very uninspired but it was clean and had stunning views of the city. I'd recommend upgrading to the Sky View room, we stayed on the 48th Floor which was fantastic.   The infinity pool: does not not disappoint. Again the views of Singapore are fantastic and you'll get some great pictures. The pool was very busy and had quite a few people splashing around which took away from the experience a bit. I can't recommend a good time to go. I went at 4pm and it was crowded and I went at 7am which was nearly just as crowded!  Food: we didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants but did have…",3
"Marine Bay Sands is simply superb, its location is great providing excellent view of the bay including the Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyer and the whole of Singapore; its size is huge with three towers of 57 floors each, having about 2500 rooms and numerous restaurants each a speciality; comprising a convention centre, casino and shopping arcades as well as a food court. The hotel has a boat shaped swimming pool at the 57th floor, which also has lounges and restaurant. But as a result the place is often very crowded, making guests wait for elevators, entry to restaurants and swimming pool.",5
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights on a business trip.   We arrived in the evening so when we checked in it was relatively quick. There are 2 reception desks - the main one at the main entrance and a smaller one near Tower 3 (there are 3 towers as per the 3 main ""legs"" of the hotel when you look at it from outside). However over the course of the next 3 days I noticed both reception desks full of lines of people checking in as buses of guest arrived throughout the day.  In terms of the standard rooms - they are relatively large however I only had a shower and not a bath included in my room. Be aware the fridges have sensors so if anything within the fridge is even moved - the system will think you have used that item and charge you for it. Complimentary water is given…",5
"This was my 1st time checking in to MBS and thought its would be grand and class..  Disappointed when I entered the lobby and the feeling just feel like walking in a market..  Though the check in counter is big but the processing just too slow.  We checked in to The Grand Club Room and overall was alright but nothing fantastic besides the view.  Infinity pool was too crowded and noisy so that u can't really enjoy the view on peace.  Next day,  we went for breakfast @ level 57 and the service was good.. Overall,  I should say MBS is overrated for the price..  To be honest,  I would prefer to stay in Shangri-la although no view but at least more peaceful and relax.",4
"Good location, good room but the hotel is very big without privacy because is a public place ! Without noise ! Price of restaurants very high. Service good but without personalize treatment ! Good security !",4
Stayed for 3 nights. Very convenient with the train station at the basement. Branded Shops are plentiful. Eateries and restaurants with a food court are located on site. You wont go hungry. The skypark on the 57th floor is a must if you are first timer. It's free entrance for guests using your room key. Night view from my room which is on the 36th floor facing the Gardens by the Bay was stunning with the colourful lights. There's a food court at the gardens as well selling local food where I ate the satay combo which comes with prawns and bbq chicken wings. Yummy.,5
"Face it you really only book this hotel if you're splurging. Hotel was very expensive, but face it again you really do it for the infinity pool. It is some pool, great views nice pool once in a lifetime experience. I'm by no means rich nor pool and like to be a budget traveler when I can but we had to go see this pool. Service was top notch the basic rooms were amazing so I can only imagine what the suites were like. Not much is included besides the room and the pool. You pay for the views! I stayed here with 2 other people in a room and they charged a hefty price for the extra person. I can't rate it any lower because the hotel itself is gorgeous connected to a mall and food courts and luxury shops. Located right by the Singapore train station and right by the Garden by the Bay…",4
"This is very happening place in Singapore.Around 9 pm have very good laser show.Must visit place Marina Bay deck on 57 floor ,you have a top view of Singapore.Lot of shopping places and one must enjoy this place in evening.",5
Really enjoy my visit back to Singa and a great place to stay. Venue is beautiful. They gave me a free upgrade and what can i say about the infinity pool - WOW!  Only down fall was room service - took over 40 minutes due to the size of the hotel!,4
"I stayed here for my last night in Singapore for a bit of a treat & I'm glad I did.  I got there early (about 1pm) and was going to leave my bag with the Bell Boy while I went to Gardens by the Bay until the 3pm check in but my room was ready so I went straight up. The room 1515 in tower 3 was spacious with everything you need with a view over the Entertainment Centre to the Merlion & The Fullerton Hotel. Bags dumped & up to the pool I go. What a spectacular view, breathtakingly stunning on a clear sunny day. I sat at the bar watching the staff do their magic with the cocktails taking it all in. Some of the best craftsmen/women I've ever seen. Headed over to Gardens by the Bay & made it back to the bar for sunset & night lights. The views got even better & the photos don't…",5
"From the first day of our three day stay we were greeted with wonderful staff, checkin could have been faster but I suspect the delay was down to guest questions rather than slow staff. We booked a club room on 40th floor which gave us access to Club 55 on three separate timings every day - this made our visit so much better! The money and time saved by getting all they provide was a massive change. The staff at club 55 remembered our names each time we were there and were professional and friendly with nothing being a problem. The food was changing daily and was always fresh and tasty, breakfast is fabulous - all included in the price of our room. The gym is lovely with complimentary towel and water with a great view and good equipment. We didn't use the pool as it was too full…",5
"Since it was a big birthday we decided to splurge and book 4 nights at the MBS. Not the cheapest hotel and the only attraction to the hotel for us was the infinity pool.  We arrived by private transport and were fortunate enough to find out that we were going to be in Tower 3 where we could check in as well. We arrived and although there are bellhopper service no one came to offer their services. A little daunting arriving with luggage and trying to find check in while their are so many people around . This is a very busy hotel. Check in was a fine and managed to get into our room earlier than we expected which was good. Given a room on 13th floor overlooking Gardens, good view with a large balcony but no chairs to sit and enjoy scenery. Bedroom not very big but bathroom with…",3
"So if you like crowd, lots of people, but also incredible this is the place. We took club level so lots of advantages ( highly recommend, free flow champagne pre diner, it is diner ;-)) very good service. The infinity pool on the top level is cool but has more people than water so it is not like the photo :-) breakfast is good but needs to be included because very $$$.   Just be ready to queue for breakfast and be surrounded by lots of people anywhrenon the hotel. Bottom line is you are a boutique hotel and like privacy stay away from this hotel if not enjoy!  For me it was nice to do it once and check the box :-)  P.S: big casino so lots of caino crowd as well. Again it all depends on your style of hotel.",4
We stayed here for 2 nights and absolutely loved it. One downside was when I checked in I was asked if I wanted to pay an extra £100 for an upgrade. My boyfriends sister had already arranged an upgrade for us as a surprise for our anniversary which means they were trying to charge me for something that I was already being given (after paying a ridiculous amount of money to stay there in the first place). Despite this the room was lovely and the rooftop pool is amazing! The view is incredible and a definite to go up there in the evening to see the city lit up! The staff are all lovely! An absolute must if you are staying in Singapore! ,5
"Visited back in 2014 but only got round to reviewing Singapore ! Great place to visit, would recommend going for a tour around the city then going up to the viewing deck of marina bay sands! Great views",5
"This was my second time visiting this hotel with my family. It was a special treat for me as I celebrated my 30th birthday. The lovely recoponist gave my family and I a higher up room (50th floor) as it was my birthday. That was very nice of them - I ceartinly didn't expect it! The room was lovely; even though it was very expensive. The pull out bed, master bed, the bathroom and the space were amazing. The food was also very nice (At Breakfast and at the pool especially). The staff were nice and kind. The hotel was very clean, and the pool, as it was the first time, was amazing! The skyline view of Singapore is amazing; not just in the pool, but also from the rooms! Even though I only stayed here for one night, it was superb. I would highly reccomend it here.",5
"We stayed here recently for a week. I must say that this is the hotel to stay at when in Singapore. This was our second trip to Singapore, and previously we stay near Orchard road. The marina bay area is juts so much better location for us. We were close to many shopping centers like Suntec City. We got a taxi to Bugis street which was only 10 mins away. We did a bit of walking and walk around the marina area and also over to boat quay.  Positives  1.	The room. We chose the Gardens by the bay side for a couple of reasons. First was we thought the view of the gardens would be nice at night with the lights. This was very true. Additionally we spend a little bit of time in the room in the morning and afternoon, and the balcony was great to get some fresh air. We stayed in tower 2…",5
We stayed in this hotel in March for 6 nights. Luckily we were accommodated on 53rd floor. Views from there are breathtaking. Room facilities exceeded our expectations. The pool is out of this world. Views - especially at night time - spectacular. Food very fresh and delicious. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. It is not cheap hotel but worth every penny. Will be returning. ,5
We stayed at MBS for one night with our 3 & 4 year old kids for a special treat.  The customer service was great!  Thanks to Joseph Lim and Cindy Go for looking after us so well.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  A unique experience to stay here and swim in the pool.  We will treasure the memories for even a short stay.,5
"Our family of four (Mum, Dad and kids aged 5 & 8) stayed here for 1 night in the middle of our 7 night trip to Singapore. We would have loved to have stayed longer, but due to budget restraints, we booked one night in a Club Room, to experience MBS and tick it off the bucket list.  We checked in via the Sands Lounge with Joseph, who was outstanding. From getting the kids ice creams while were doing the paperwork, to finding us the best room he could (tower 2, 4254, right in front of the nightly light show) and arranging late check out, Joseph went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, and this service was echoed by very staff member we encountered at MBS.  Our room was amazing; huge, clean and luxurious. The bathroom just as lovely with a great selection of toiletries.…",5
"I've stayed at this hotel twice (once with work and once with friends). Both times I have been disappointed!   Firstly, the hotel rooms are pretty average - especially for the rate you pay, also the service is terrible and breakfast and drinks are expensive as rarely included.  Whilst the pool is great, it's freezing cold and crowded.   Staff are unhelpful, borderline rude and stuck up. Also, I've not been helped with my bags on either of my trips. Very impersonal service!   All in all, you're just another cog in the mill at this hotel. There is no flexibility at all (for example no using the pool after checking out and you can't collect sands rewards points if the hotel is not in your name - even if you're paying for part of it!!)   Save yourself the money and check out one of…",3
"Let's be honest. You are only here for the pool, right?  The pool is fab. Probably the ""selfie"" epicentre of Asia - if not globally.   Get over that and what's left is a huge, impersonal hotel attached to a premium brand shopping mall and casino designed to part Chinese visitors with their hard earned. From what I saw, they were doing that brilliantly.   I was attending a conference in the onsite expo so the location was great for me. It was also a beautiful walk to the gardens by the bay right opposite. Everything else was good or better apart from the fact that it was completely and totally homogeneous - it might as well have been in Savannah,  Georgia.  It was also properly expensive. I'm happy to pay up but the prices were 5* bonkers.   Last time I was in Singapore we stayed…",3
"Where do I start....  Upon arrival, the queues are akin to an airport check-in lounge, no one to greet you, just wait your turn.  When you eventually get served (this is what it feels like; very transactional) then there is very little chatter, just the necessary details. Little information from the hotel reception, a few pamphlets, and no mention of breakfast options or rules governing their other faciltiies...like the pool (we'll get to that)  The room is fine, what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We were on the 4th floor, which I mean...that wasn't too exciting, but I got over this loss, as room allocation is a bit of a lottery.  Fast forward to breakfast, we rocked up to the 57th floor (after a gargantuan wait for the lift to get there...did I mention it feels like…",1
"Marina Bay Sands has such an amazing view; especially from the pool. To get the full experience, all you need to do is stand at the edge of the pool gazing at the beautiful view. The rooms are so nice, they gave us a high room with a great view and a very massive room. Which, was lovely as they did it purely as it is my twin son's 13th Birthday. The pool is a great temperature. It is all amazing. There are only two downsides, one of them is the food is not the best. The food is okay to eat, but if you had to do it for a week, it could be a bit better. That is only my opinion. Also, the Staff are not very smiley or kind. The receptionists were lovely. Although, overall lovely! I cannot wait to see you again Marina Bay Sands!",5
"One of the memorable stays in Singapore, gorgeous view, awesome food with the star attraction as infinity rooftop pool having the best view of Singapore sky lines, will definitely visit again. Expensive hotel but worth every penny! Very welcoming and lovely staff  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5
"We stayed for 1 night since hubby and friends went for the Ultra music festival. It's our 3rd stay here and it left us with the best impression. Service standards have improved rather significantly. There was a breakfast queue at Sky on 57, we were served orange juice in the line. The queue was shorter at Spago but we were told that there are more vegetarian options at Sky 57. We told the section waitress about our vegan diet when we ordered soy latte at our table. As we reached the buffet section, the F&B manager was already waiting to walk us through the spread, he showed us the vegan dishes we could have. We booked the premier king room with a fantastic view of the Gardens By The Bay. Be sure to respond to their online check-in form before your travel dates for express…",4
We were here for 3 nights. The room was big but there were not much thugs in the room. Room was not so classy. There was no bath tub. Not much thing for guests to enjoy without paying money. No coffee machine. Not much facility in room only big bed and nice view. We did enjoy the INFINITI pool. The pool was not that big but nice for taking picture. Too crowded! But the service was so excellent!!! The cleanliness and comfort was PERFECT!!! ,4
"One thing I love about Marina Bay Sands is the architecture of it. The room was spacious and has a luxurious feeling, not to mention the rooftop pool! Service was excellent from check-in, dining and check-out. Highly recommended.",5
"Last year, in October, me with two good friends of mine decided to go to a spiritual retreat in Bali. But, before that, we thought we have to see Singapore and stay for one night at the popular Marina Bay Sands. We've seen pictures, but we never thought it could be such an amazing experience. First of all, the guy at the reception desk upgraded our room and gave us one with the most amazing view located in the third tower where the pool was.  Second, that pool! It was one of my best experiences ever. The view, the feeling you have when you are up there... I can't describe it in words. You just have see it and live it! Believe me! I will go back there, for sure!",5
"Wow! This place is its own little city in and of itself. Marina Bay Sands was beautiful as were the attractions that it connected too including, The Shoppes, Casino and Gardens. We came in from our flight and were immediately escorted to a lounge to relax as they checked us in - no standing in lines. The hotel was impeccable and a must see if you are in Singapore. ",5
"We decided to stay here on our last night of our holiday as we were sucked in by the pictures of the infinity pool (like most I'm assured).  What can I say, the place is expensive but worth every penny. The service was flawless, the room was perfect with an amazing view of the gardens by the bay.. And ofcourse that infinity pool. That pool made our holiday. The view was utterly breath taking.  This place is not for those tight with money, you stay at MBS and you spend up at MBS! Just an idea of price, a poolside burger is $30.",5
"One of the memorable stays in Singapore and iconic hotel here, great view, awesome food with the star attraction as infinity rooftop pool having the best view of Singapore sky lines, will definitely visit again!",5
"What a amazing place the view is to die for and lovely people had a blast , bit expensive though but still you get what you pay for and the service was excellent though, totally recommend if your in Singapore ",5
"Even if you can only afford to stay for 1 night, try it and stay in other hotels the rest of the time. It's a masterpiece in so many ways. Don't forget to swim in the pool overlooking the entire Singapore!",5
I have travelled many places，for the past 2 months in Singapore，I was very disappointed that I have not found any amazing genuine service until today when I approached Param in Consierge. He was very attentive knowledgeable and professional. Compared to the service I had in other F&B outlets and counters inside Marina Bay Sands，he is like breeze to my trip. ,4
"As usual, satisfied of our stay in Marina bay sands even bit cosly (rooms) and always bit crowed !!! Attendance and understanding of our needs by mgnt was very appreciated. Our specials thanks to Clinton - mgnt/spv from guest assistance (orchid suite 5302 27-29 may). Nothing to say about the rooms : 5*",5
"Bumpy start but amazing experience. I highly recommend to everyone that if they can afford it, even spend one night here. The pool experience is something of this world. We are still talking about it to this day.  So this was our stay. We had a few issues at the check in desk but Mr. Sri Ram, the Front Office Manager acted quickly to resolve them in conjunction with Faye (Swiss stewardess). If it wasn't for them, all the great things would have been totally forgotten under the bad experience. Also, the Club 55 Manager was EXCELLENT. The staff in general was very well trained and understand good customer service. The pool is stunning. The gym is great. I highly recommend the cocktail hour at Club 55. The amuse bouches were fantastic. I was shocked of how good the quality of the…",5
"I have spent a few nights in this Hotel during a conference. Is a ""Vegas"" style Hotel including a 20 min queue to check in and if you opt for the usual check out, it took me another 10 minutes. The Hotel is average in design, service, and breakfast for what you pay but nothing to say when it comes to the view and the pool and they are good to leverage on that as the place is really busy. Worth it to try once but in my opinion, I have stayed in better and more charming places in Singapore. Last but not least, rooms are big.",3
"Marina Bay Sands is now one of Singapore's iconic landmarks, with its three towers and huge infinity swimming pool, gardens, track and more across the top of all three towers. The rooftop pool and park I give 5 stars. The hotel is very big and busy with lots of shops, a casino, restaurants and lots and lots of people, both the people staying here at the hotel and many others viewing it as a sight.  One additional caveat, if you are staying in the hotel then you don't have a view of the iconic sight, The Marina Bay Sands. So I am torn. Good either way I suppose.",4
588 SGD a night and you are not allowed to use the famous and precious infinite pool after your 11 am check out.  Tools three managers to consider my plea and reject it.   Can u call it customer service when procedures are so inflexible. Couple of robots would do!,1
"We stayed there for the pool and that's really the only reason! In my opinion, it's a must in Singapore because it is the only way you can get into the pool. The hotel itself isn't that nice. It reminds you of a hotel in Vegas. It's huge, hard to get around, not that great of service. It is overpriced but they can almost charge what they want because of the pool. They know people will stay. The wifi wasn't great, as it kept disconnecting and reconnecting when walking around the hotel. It is not conveniently laid out and we had a difficult time getting back there from Gardens by the Bay at night. There wasn't enough signs pointing us in the right direction. There's a lot of restaurants and shopping in the hotel and the surroundings. Almost all are pricey. $45 breakfast buffet one…",4
we enjoyed this hotel very much -- the room is big and has a great view from the window room. the pool at the sky is  beautiful -the gardens near the hotel are beautiful and the shopping center close to the hotel is must.,5
"If you visit Singapore than your trip never complete if you dint stay at  marina bay sands. yes its a some how costlier but you can cut your some shopping  and stay at this hotel for the awesome experience. Room was awesome , room service is excellent  and last but not the least you can experience the one of the world most amazing swimming pool at the top of Hotel its a life time experience and if you have lots of money to spend than there is very big casino and some most expensive brand showrooms are also located at Marina bay sands so at the end dint miss to stay at sand marina bay if you visit Singapore.",5
"I wouldn't stay here again. As far as hotels go its pretty average. The only reason to stay here is to access the pool, now that I've done that I'll stay in other hotels around Singapore. This one had a sterile atmosphere, food was terrible and the pool was actually a bit of a mess.",3
"1 of the finest place in singapore..surrounded by hi fi malls,casino and a luxirous hotel...roof top hotel with pool and dozens of trees on it....nice atmosphere and a great view of the city...nice hospitality there...",5
Great place to stay and we have stayed several times before. The Infinity Pool is just amazing. Across the road to the Gardens and Handy to a huge shopping centre with plenty of shops and food outlets. Casino close buy for those that use those facilities. A very busy Hotel. Great friendly staff.We always stay at Club 55 Just a amazing place with beautiful staff.,5
"Had a good stay in 3rd tower Orchid Suite, for starters the room size was huge, 2 balconies, which did not get much use during our trip. Went outside twice, once to take a photo of Gardens by the bay at night and a second time to see the fighter jets fly over after the noise shook (what felt like) the whole building on a Tuesday morning (10am).  We upgraded to an orchid suite to use club 55, 55th floor of 2nd tower. Due to the food and drink provided at scheduled times throughout the day this was very cost effective in comparison to the cost of the other hotel bars and restaurants. Food was buffet style but didn't feel like we needed much more. Good choice of food for vegetarians.  Mini bar is not included even with the addition of club 55 benefits. Ordered room service one…",4
"Mr tamil bell boy is the only good service that i truly received when i checked in three times at this high end so called five star hotel. He serve me beyond expectation and consolidate my luggage when i visited the hotel on my own. He understood what i need and he helped me deliver and unpack my luggage when my energy is low.   When i encounter problem and seeking for management help, the only one who really listen is the senior manager from service side Ms. Charmaine Ho. I admire her professionalism and work ethic. Hope she can help me till the end to solve my problem. The way i see it, mbs is a good hotel and is one of my favorite however service staff are arrogant. Hopefully they can provide further service training as what the hotel director promise me. I still keep his…",4
"A hotel with everything in and around it. It has undoubtedly the best Infinity pool, which is ginormous too, though divided per wing/building. The hotel boasts lots of lovely restaurants, Sky 57 one of those has a a great view. Our room had a beautiful view of Gardens by the Bay and SuperTrees. The hotel is connected to a  huge Mall with all the luxury brands, and is walking distance to Merlion, also on the way to Merlion there are multiple eating joints. The only downside is, the hotel being huge & popular of course attracts lot of guests, leading to long ques at check-in. This hotel is worth everything.",5
"We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel with its skypark and a lap pool thrown in. Though expensive as we stayed in the Orchid Suite, we were given VIP treatment at the lounge and the cafe. The rooms come with a living room ensuite to a bedroom. The views of the Singapore River and beyond are superb if you stay on a high floor.",5
"We arrived to Marina Bay on our way home from Koh Samui and were looking forward to everything Marina Bay had to offer.  We were directed to the VIP Check in along with our 4 friends but we didn't really receive a VIP Check in. Our room wasn't ready at 4pm and we accpeted that but we were literally told that we should go and wait in our friends room and they would drop keys up when it was ready(apparently they were removing a smell). 2 hours later we still had not room and no luggage.  We had a booking at Spago at 7:30pm and we were told we could just shower in the gym before we went to dinner.... no idea what I was going to wear? Anyway, after my husband told them to just give us whatever was available we scored ourselves an upgraded suite right across the hall from our friends…",3
"The view from the pool is out of this world and you are just a few steps away from Gardens by the Bay' (a definite must see). Casino down the hotel, shops, eateries, shows and exhibitions all year round. Closely located to Universal Studios and ferries to island such as St John's. Only issues is that the hotel is so massive that is feels a little impersonal (not human-scaled). But otherwise, HIGHLY recommended and thanks to all the  Marina Bay Team, we got upgraded on our room!!! Go for high-stories view!",5
"We went for a upgraded a executive sky view room and the room is amazing. And then the luxury is pretty much done. Not even the bottle water is included, no extra upgrade on the infinity pool and a room service so expensive that it leaves you with a bitter taste. I think MBS could benefit from seeing how a few other ""show them your money"" places retain the luxury image/treatment throughout the stay by also including additional benefits (ie. reserved area) around the pool, free transportation, etc.",3
"Staying here for a week for a trade show and here is the good and the bad;  Good  -Location is great -Food and drinks are very good but extremely expensive (Tiger beer is $14 in the mini bar, $9 for a six pack in the ajoining mall) -57th floor restautant food was great (had a japanese whisky and the Angus burger) Room is very clean and maid service has been great every day. - rooftop infinity pool area is very nice, the view is one of the best I have ever seen  Not good  -Service at 57th floor bar was horrible.  Waitress was very unfriendly and came across as not happy/curt. We spent 150 on 2 drinks, a burger and a lobster roll...first time in over a year I didn't tip. Even in Australia the service was better and that's saying a lot. - Having to continually sign in for wifi.…",3
"We stayed here for only one night as it is quite expensive to stay at. The place is really incredible. We got the Deluxe King Sky View room and the view was spectacular.  The infinity pool was the main reason we wanted to stay here, and it didn't disappoint. If you intend on staying here, just remember that it is expensive. The buffet breakfast was $45 per person. It's also a very busy hotel, there are people everywhere. To get a room service breakfast, you have to pre-order your meal the night before.  We very much enjoyed our stay at this hotel.",5
"When I came to this hotel, i was expecting luxury and exclusive things all around. the building is very nice and the view is amazingly beautiful. But they have a horrible staff around everywhere.   The first thing happened to me was when I went to the bar, i said hi to two greeters and those girls didn't even greet me back. Then guy behind me came without saying anything and they was like ""oh hello Sir, welcome! blah blah"" and I was standing there and feeling very unpleasant also embarrassed. wasn't they look at me or something?  When I got a table, I drank about 8 glasses of cocktails, it wasn't that great but looked pretty anyway, and every single time I ordered, I have to raised my hand for a long time to make them actually came. they saw but not immediately came.  In an…",2
Traveled with my fiance for a conference. Her first time in SG and our first at MBS.  This trip was one for the books!   And it was all thanks to Wangelin! We were both touched by your personal touch of hospitality and attention. The welcome gift with our wedding photo enclosed (photo was taken the day before we arrvied) was absolutely the best feeling to arrive to after a 7-hour flight!  Thank you again for allowing us to turn our business trip into a vacation or as my fiance is calling it a 'bacation' lol  This was truly a memorable trip for us AND on top of everything we did quite well for ourselves at the casino our last night =)  Hope to see you again in the near future as a returning guest and until then an MBS evangelist!,5
"With all the glory that comes with the name 'Marina Bay Sands', our stay at the hotel was extremely disappointing and unwelcoming. We hosted a function in the hotel ballroom, spent thousands of dollars for MBS, and were treated so unwell.   On the first day, my sister lost her key and when we went to reception to get a new one- they demanded we pay $100 excluding tax!! For one key!  There are 6 lifts for each tower so you would expect to be picked up quickly, but we waited for ages until a lift came. The frustration easily built up.  Moreover, it is not practical to use guest lifts for luggage carriers.   ROOMS: When it comes to the room, our toilet got blocked and stayed clogged for 4 hours until someone came to fix it.   STAFF: the cleaning team were very nice yet the staff in…",1
"Overall good hotel. Views are spectacular, lots of choices for food (not all in hotel complex) but too big and lacks that personal service. Paid for the Club access and apart from the view on Club 55 the food was basic - not much of a variety more for the Asian market. Staff up there are very friendly. Is  definitely  something you've got to do once.",4
"I stayed for the infinite pool, and it worths totally! Even the pool is always crowded but the view is amazing. The view from my room was great as well. Didnt have too much contact with the staff! Will be back soon!",5
"After reading many TA reviews we couldn't work out if we could go up to the roof top bar, the cost and what to expect so here it is:   Location: tower 3, go to reception of Ce La Vie on ground floor. Pay $20 SGD to reception and head straight to lifts, head up to Ce La Vie restaurant / bar (level 57)   Level 57: out of Lift, can either go straight ahead to front bar ( amazing views but very hot on sunny day) or you can turn right and look for sign CLUB LOUNGE. We arrived about 4pm and had our choice of seats at front bar then we went exploring and found a much bigger area with amazing views right next to the pool (no acres to pool) and with comfy lounges and big umbrellas.   $20 SGD cover charge voucher can be used towards a drink - lots of amazing cocktails and all other…",5
"We did not have booking to hand and was given basic room, reception literally didn't acknowledge booking.Until my husband found the booking, everything changed they had to admit that they were wrong but the attitude in reception was unbelievable The poolside literally majority of the residents/paying guests interest was taking selfies, which I found tacky and not what's one's expectation to have in one of the top hotels in the world.",2
"The view of the hotel do not come close to the views FROM the hotel. The pool at the top is incredible, albeit a bit busy at times, and there are even hot tubs looking out to the sea too. Checking in was a bit slow to be critical, but the service was excellent. There is so much to see and do in and around the hotel, that it is like it's own city, so make sure you tour the rest of the city first before you start your stay. ",5
Nothing to compare this hotel...everything was good and luxury.  The infnity pool is the best one i ever see and and the breakfast moment in the lobby area...is a great breakfast i ever had. Sky park it so really nice in the evening where we can see the Marina Bay and the Garden Bay.,5
"Loved staying at the hotel! We were upgraded to a bay view room on checking in. All staff are very helpful and pleasant.  The room we stayed in was lovely, lots of facilities and very spacious.  The infinity pool is incredible, I was expecting a mass of people crammed into the pool it was the total opposite, plenty of available sun beds and lots of space in the pool. Drinks and snacks by the pool are great.  Thanks Marina Bay Sands for a great night!! ",5
"Good harbour location for local activities and places to eat. Check in is 15:00 so be prepared for a long wait in reception if you arrive earlier. We were able to get into our room almost immediately but other guests didn't appear to be so lucky.   We paid for an upgrade to our room so that we could get free breakfast on a separate floor but it would seem that that is what everybody else had decided to do resulting in a busy breakfast experience.   The hotel does not a mall attached but mostly designer shops, though there were a few good restaurants   Final thought : this ""exclusive"" hotel has not become so big that it no longer feels exclusive. Not sure it's really worth the money",3
"We came to Singapore for the food!  And I mean the street hawkers, as there was plenty to choose from.   Marina Bay Sands was nice and all, but for the price I was really paying for the views and the pool.  Everything was overly priced, but I guess you have to pay for the amenities of the building...  The building itself was amazing!  Casino was nothing great.  Staff was fairly nice, every time we would request our room to be made up, we'd walk in to a new animal shaped towel, which was definitely a nice touch.  Shopping mall is right next door, all the expensive name brands were located in there.  We went to happy hour, and it was $14 for a glass of Asahi :( Nice thing is, you are close to Super Grove Trees and the Garden.  And did I mention the pool?  Haha, yes, the pool is…",4
"In my opinion, a trip to Singapore just isn’t complete without staying at Marina Bay Sand!!!  This hotel met all my expectations.  Check in line was super long but while you wait, they provide water and ice-cream.  I was there a bit earlier than the check in time of 3 pm but was granted a room right away! My room had great views of Garden by the Bay.  And the infinity pool is just as amazing as expected but gets crowded easily—be sure to go there early otherwise it gets crowded during the day with everyone taking selfies.  The room was a nice size, very clean although the bathroom was a bit average.  I expected it to look nicer for a five star hotel.  Hotel has MRT and mall right underneath with food court, making it very convenient. Definitely worth staying here! Highlight of…",5
We had been to Mbs in June with family..the infinity pool is amazing..the rooms are very basic..though we booked for king size bed..we got a queen size bedroom which they claim is king sized. The drinking water after first 2 small bottles was chargeable..which we found very obnoxious..for a category of hotel at which Marina Bay Sands is. When we were checking out they asked us to pay for the kid for breakfast.. because room entitles only 2 adult breakfast..though while booking the hotel we had mentioned the age of kids and all details. The casino is good..not very small nor too grand. Overall a little disappointing experience..since at a class of Mbs..we expected better hospitality. ,2
"If u only have one hour of sightseeing or short stays or inconviniently move around so much then pls come n just spend ur time here!  All the singapore icons in a single place!  Choose either garden by the bay view or marina bay view (the most breathtaking scenary in singapore) Please also choose the highest floor possible!  Go for a swim at invinity pool 57th floor and 150m length of swimming pools overlooking marina bay, come early in the morning once they open before it gets too crowded and hard to take pic!  You may only swim when u stay in this hotel!!  Excellent bed quality!

"I HAVE STAYED AT FULLERTON, PAN PACIFIC, RITZ CARLTON AND THEY ALL GIVE BETTER SERVICE FOR THE SAME PRICE, BETTER STAY AT THOSE HOTELS FOR BETTER VALUE AND TREATED WITH MORE RESPECT FOR THE OVER SGD 1000 YOU WILL SPEND  I stayed here in 2013 and then the reservation service was excellent, got 2 suite rooms at a great price and overall my relatives had a great time.  4 years later, how things have changed. for nearly the same price as previously I had 2 normal rooms with no breakfast.  check in service was slow and inefficient, why send me an SMS for details for faster check in and still ask the same questions again? when I asked the staff this, she said it was just to confirm my details, but she asked me twice!! the reception staff next to her checked in a larger group in half…",2
"Awesome hotel, awesome location, awesome city.  Staff are friendly and cooperative. Food is wonderful. Rooms are clean and well kept up.   The view from the roof top swimming pool with a glass of champagne is well worth the experience.   But if you're not willing to experience truckloads of drugged up Russian prostitutes steaming through the hotel at all hours, rich drunk English/Italian/American men running after them and nonstop coaches of nouveau riche Chinese tourists, you might want to avoid.",4
"...to take pictures in the pool.  Ironically, you won't enjoy the pool itself, because there are soooo many people taking pictures, it is annoying. You can't really swim in there because of it. Hot spas on the opposite side are quite cool though.   Rooms are nice and spacious, we had a room with a city view on 35th floor and our parents had a sky room on 45th floor. The price is much higher, but honestly, there was no difference apart from them having a bath tub which in my opinion was useless.  The view is amazing from both rooms but there is no difference between 35th or 45th floor.  What I didn’t like, is staff not communicating well. There is no map provided at check-in or anything like that. This place is huge and it is easy to get lost when you are here for the first time.…",4
"It was actually a company D&D, and I'm pretty sure everyone did enjoy their stay there. The room is quite cozy, everything is provided in room,and in the bathroom. They have safe and  steam Irons which I needed that time. The view on the pool is very nice and it is actually already open at 6 in the morning , it is plus because if you are morning person you just need it.  What I also like is that The rooftop ,where you can unwind , drink and relax of course ,are separated from the main guest and those who just access on the pool and it's quite good for me.  I must say if you are a fan of taking pictures from below , then definitely it is more fun taking pictures from the TOP😊,check mine. ",5
"We frequent MBS for staycations/events/gala night. It is always a pleasant stay. Room service was fantastic. Food variety was excellent. The suite rooms were really nice and clean. We love to stay in the room to chill and catch some movies.   The MRT station (bayfront) is just a few minutes walk underground from the hotel. You could also cross the road to the shopping area. There's so many things to do near by! Way too convenient.   We love the city view and garden view. You can view the gardens by the bay right from the balcony. Some rooms really have a huge balcony, depending on which level you are on. City view offers a magnificent view of the city skyscrapers and the floating platform by the waters.   Definitely recommend to go up for the buffet style breakfast at Club 55,…",5
"Terrific hotel, staff and amenities first class. I recommend staying on a high floor, harbor view in tower 3. As adult only pool nearby(level 57)and close to walk to Spagos and other bars on skywalk. If you visit casino remember to carry your passport at all times. Great access to shops/trains/food courts without the humidity.",5
"We got an upgrade, and where able to check in early. The room itself was nice, pretty spacious and great balcony with a view. No balcony furniture though...   Headed directly to the pool around checkout time for other guests, by far the best and only time to really enjoy the pool. After that it just becomes a public pool.   Service is ok but nothing special. The waitresses in the rooftop restaurant are not the friendliest. They have a misplaced attitude, great bartenders though. Pool service is ok, reception staff friendly.   Elevators during checkout are a joke. 30 minutes to get to the reception. They thought about everything, except sufficient elevators :).  All in all, pretty good experience for one night. But if it's not to see the pool, would recommend another hotel,…",3
"Must stay place in S're. However MBS needs to add customer ease orientation. They are good but check in and check out is little bit time consuming. Awesome rooms,  great pool and remarkable location. This is yes for my next trip. I know u guys turnaround 2500 rooms almost on daily basis, pl focus on making checkins quicker. Using lifts during morning 9 to 11 am is just nightmare, had to wait for almost 15 mins to go to 57th floor from 36th, pl do something. Good luck. ",4
"Brilliant stay at MBS from start to finish. We live in Singapore so this was just an overnight stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary - but it was perfect. From fast track check in, free room upgrade, amazing pool (day and night) and the views that go with it, right through to leaving with express checkout (which took literally 10 seconds)....the stay was great. Comfortable, great staff, amazing views, awesome food.",5
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights and enjoyed being spoiled throughout our stay.  We arrived around 1pm and went straight to checkin. This is my only negative comment on our stay, because the queue for checkin was far too long and they didnt seem to be organised at all. It took us maybe 20 minutes to finally be able to checkin, so yes.. far too long. However, the checkin process from then onwards went very smoothly and they were able to give us a really nice room for our category, on the 37th floor, with a beautiful view. The view on the gardens by the bay is better than on the other side - and also, the pool faces the opposite side of the gardens so if you are able to get a room on the opposite side of the pool, then you will have two beautiful views!   Our room…",5
"Everything was amazing, just make sure you look for the adult side of the pool if you are traveling without kids! Make sure you are there for the sunset and be ready to find a lounge chair if you get up there late ",5
"The infinity pool is amazing and the room was absolutely nice, we spent there five days and everything was perfect. Anytime we asked for help for something the response was immediate, at any time. Customer service was perfect! Even out 4yo girl was amazed, especially when she found on the bed two little rabbits made with towels :-) Nothing to say, just WOW! Really worth it!",5
"Very enjoyable couple of nights stay.   The place is big, brash but the staff are very helpful. If you can afford get a suite as club55 made our visit really. Afternoon tea & evening drinks are a must. Swimming pool is noisy & great for selfies but not a place to go to meditate!",5
"I stayed in MBS just for the Infinity Pool since it is not accessible for normal public (only for the residents). Although the room had an amazing view of the City, the interior was basic and little disappointing for the price that I had paid. There is no doubt about the cleanliness and courteousness of the staffs - they are excellent..",4
This is the place one can get an entry to Marina Bay sands & only way to see the infinity pool on top of Marina Bay Sands. The bar is a nice place with music & the view is astounding. A 20 $ entrance is charged & one gets credit for food & drinks. Best to get there by 5.45 well before sunset to get a table. ,4
"No one can't enter the swimming pool area except people who is staying in this hotel. For me, that's our privillage who pay more to stay here. There is nothing special for the room, just like other 5 star hotel. I love the bathroom, bath tub, and I love the swimming pool. I stay in tower 1 and I can see the beautiful Garden bay the bay from my Balcony!. :)",5
"This is a wonderful place( hotel) to stay. You have everything around you, travel different locations easily with train from hotel underground station.  Friendly staff from front desk to Restaurants and very helpful and always smiling. Great place indeed with lots of memories, the tea afternoon, cocktail time and the cheese and chocolate evening. The rooms are very spacious. I surely recommend at least two nights with Marina Bay Sands. ",5
"The pool is amazing, great view. This is a iconic building in Singapore and the hotel relies on it. The chaos starts with a 15 min que for check in, surrounded by hoards of people, does not feel exclusive at all. Then the bathroom flooded, the TVs was broke despite asking for a repair. The lifts are terrible and I had to wait twenty mins for an empty lift on checkout, only to then join another 15 mins que. For the price we paid I was not impressed, they clearly are happy to except poor service and solely rely on the impressive infrastructure. They could learn a lot from other five star hotels. ",2
"We love the sky pool which has a scenic view of the city. The jacuzzi is lovely too. However there's nothing much to do there except walk around the shops for kids. One alternative is you can visit the art science museum. However as we have visited it before , we didn't go there this time round. ",5
"The hotel is now a landmark of Singapore, its structure is fascinating and the pool is a great piece of architecture. The hotel is a luxury hotel, and so are the prices of whatever is inside the hotel, if you look for an easy dinner you need to go otu from the hotel. However, there is a kind of ""confusion"" in the hall and the some moments in the infinity pools due to the number of visitors.  The room was large, with a nice view on the gardens. Coffee pot and some free water all days, appreciated. The hotel is nicely linked to the underground, 20-30 minutes from the airport and few stops from everywhere in town. Wifi is horrible, almost any time we checked the device it was necessary to reconnect, it happened with several devices and o.s.",4
"The place is cool, but for the price and the hype it didn't live up to expectations. Too many annoyances and issues that I wouldn't expect to deal with.   1. No line at check-in, but the process took over 20 minutes. They didn't have a king bed so suggested we could have a double bed room and push them together if we wanted to sleep together. Seeing as they knew we were on our honeymoon, separate beds was an absurd suggestion.  2. No restaurants are open late. The front desk said the food court was open 24/7, but that is incorrect. When we explained they wasted over half an hour of our time walking to this 24/7 food court (it is far away) they said we were wrong. We weren't, no one in the food court would serve us food at 11pm. 3. Our TV didn't work in our room. 4. No AC in the…",3
Awesome hotel. The view from the top swimming pool is breathtaking! There's a lounge/dining area on the rooftop pool which is pretty hip. Love all the shopping that you could do inside the hotel.  Definitely a must destination placebo add  on your bucket list !,4
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.  The hotel arranged a limo transfer from the airport and this was extremely professional.  We were met as we left the plane and before immigration control and were swiftly escorted to our car (plane landing to getting to hotel just an hour).  The driver called in that we were arriving and we were met at the door, taken straight to our lovely room in Tower 1 (3792) which was a corner room with views both of the harbour and the gardens.  Check-in was done swiftly in our room (a club lounge room).  Unfortunately we had a problem with our key cards and were refused access to the pool and we were sent away to sort this out ourselves (not a great start).  The room was beautiful and very comfortable but we were not impressed with Club 55 and after…",4
the hotel is nice especially the swimming pool view other than that nothing special ..the have good breakfast.,3
"The hotel is great. Service is excellence and the pool experience has no words. Nevertheless, for the price (which is not cheap) I expected also a breakfast. Room is spacious and comfortable. The views are exceptional. The SPA is fantastic. Really recommend it, mainly because of the pool...",4
"I came to Singapore for business visit and stayed at MBS.   The service personell was very friendly and helpful. The room was perfect, just small issue: the air con was little bit too loud.   But anyhow this Hotel is sure worth a visit.   The view, the infinity pool on the 57th floor, the service, breakfast and everything else is on a very high level.   For breakfast they have a big variety of fresh fruits, some dim sum, cornflakes and whatever you prefer.  In the evening they serve cocktails where u had breakfast. Cocktails and nice music is a perfect match 👌🏼  So should u have a chance, stay at least for one night in MBS. ",5
We decided to visit Singapore for our wedding anniversary. I was interested in the architecture and the regeneration that the city had undertaken over the past 5 years. Wow! What a delight and a pure credit to the country. Singapore was amazing and one of our favourite destinations so far.   Marina Bay Sands was simply amazing - decadent pure luxury. As a child free location it ticked all the boxes!   We walked over 40km whilst we were visiting in 5 days. Mixing it up with public transport it really was the perfect short destination!,5
"Where to start. Firstly everyone should try and stay here! I am not usually one to splurge on hotels however my husband and I went to Singapore for my 30th birthday so we decided to splurge and we are SO glad we did! We felt like celebrities staying here. We stayed in tower 3 on floor 35 and had the most perfect view of Gardens by the Bay. Staff were lovely and helpful and they even delivered cake on my birthday!  The pool! Breathtaking, it is a good as you see in the photos. Although it does get busy so go first thing or late at night. Children also aren't allowed in the pool which i loved however some people still tried to sneak their children in, however got told to move on. You have to have a cocktail by the pool too! Even if they are a little over-priced. The only…",5
"We really enjoyed staying at the Marina Bay Sands. The service for such a large hotel was very good, and we found all the staff friendly. The room was lovely, large and comfortable, with a balcony and super view of the gardens by the bay. The Infinity pool is superb, we used this at night, it had fantastic views, and was cooling on warm nights, as many towels as you need too. We went to the Skypark when waiting for our room which again had fantastic views. Marina Bay also had a super shopping centre. This is an experience and you get value for your money. Recommended!!",5
"A vista eyeshot. The exotic view from the balcony of the garden view room quenches the thirsty eyes. One cannot expect anything better than this from any higher floor. Standing in tower 3 on an 18 th floor balcony, A bewildering & breathtaking view rejuvenates your heart, mind & soul. A stunning & panoramic Harbour front ocean view  outlooking the Beautiful Blu sky with white clouds & underneath a plush & green paradise ' Gardens By The Bay '  The night view enhanced the spectacular tower trees of the garden with beautiful & magnificent lighting. The bright colored tree towers were glowing in radiance scintillating a rich & a picturesque.   Early check in & late check out -/+ 2 hours considered. Every Receptionist is gracious enough with etiquette & pleasing communication. Great…",4
"There is something magical in this hotel, whenever i plan to visit Singapore, I always end up staying at this hotel. Its a great all-round hotel for solo, family, business & couples.   I recommend visiting this place and I will be there soon.  Thank you MBS staff for the great service.",5
"Ok iconic, amazing view but it feels like an airport terminal.  The noise, the multiple restaurants and towers and reception gives it a weird feel.  Also lots of people here from the mall / casino etc.  I understand this is a ""destination place"" but the whole turnstiles on the pool terrace and guards makes you feel there is just a through put of people and you are lucky you are allowed in attitude / place to see and be seen.  Amazing up top view, gym is very large and good, just under the pool level so great view.  Though top of tower 2 so if you are in another tower its up -->  turnstile -->  turnstile -- > down - Ridiculous high end mall attached (Italian-esque gondolas, really?) though good food hall.  Felt Vegas-cy and bling.",4
"Why not stay here if you can. And if you can't, make it happen. It's a must A superb hotel, filled with amenities. Adjacent casino and a huge shopping mall. Easy access to the gardens. An infinity pool on the 57th floor, that's a wow! Tips: 1. Great Pre/post cruise hotel. Only 10 min by taxi to/from CRUISE TERMINAL 2. Pool access is for hotel guest only. 3. Tower 2 has chocolate and cheese buffet available 4. Adrift bar at the lobby have great wines and cocktails  Special thanks to Jessie Tan Sze Nee (Guest service agent) for making a effort to answer all my questions. Your professionalism is what guest come back to.",5
"Had a wonderful stay with my fiance, while celebrating CNY with my family. Beds are amazing, along with the great view. It is the ""go to"" hotel to stay when your're here in Singapore. Especially if you want to get that iconic photo at the scenic infinity pool at the roof.",5
"Beside being one of the main landmarks in Singapore, MBS is also a wonderful hotel and resort. We stayed here for just one night but it was an amazing experience. Just to experience the pool on top of the hotel and the price tag is worth it. When we visited it was never too crowded and we could enjoy the views as much as possible.  The check-in/check-out experiences is great, quick and easy. The room look great but the furniture has some marks and it is a bit dated. The bathtub is huge and if you want to enjoy some romantic moments with your partner, it's a must have upgrade.  Best part in our case was the view. I could get enough of the Singapore skyline.  I would come here any change i get.",5
The pool and views are breath taking. The rooms are well appointed and the Front check in and room cleaning staff are magnificent.  Located close to public transport or you walk to local attractions. It was worth the Money,5
Stayed here with sone friends on a stag party. Check in was plain sailing and rooms were fantastic. As with singapore drinks and food were expensive but we expected that.  The roof top pool was great and the no children policy in certain pools was enforced which made it more relaxing. If you go to the casino then dont expect much. You will need to take your passport and getting a drink at the table while possible is not frequent. The atmosphere is terrible and this is down to all the locals and how rude they are. I would not go back to casino,5
Best stay ever!! The rooms are fully technology equiped and everything is just so perfect  Really enjoyed my stay over there with my family.  The infinity pool has such a amazing view of the skyline of Singapore.  Highly recommended for people who are looking for a leisure stay in Singapore. ,5
The property just gets better every time you go there. Had a great time this time round in Singapore. Great with family or friends. Their rooftop infiniti pool is absolutely breathtaking. Also a great place for kids.,5
"Impressive City Night View, Never forget the feeling of Lying on sofa with a glass of wine in front of the great glass window panel. Spacious Suite, Large and Comfortable bathroom. These make you feel an Emperor. Friendly and Smiling faces of Service people. Particularly, Cindy's helpful and patient service did win our heart.  Fall short on: Fail in maintenance of: 1.Karaoke system,  2. TV in Living Room,  3. one of the 3 Shower heads does not work,  4. Jacussi water tap, and,  Without Utensils provided, the very nice Mini Kitchen is meaningless; Light Switches are complicate and not User Friendly.",4
Marina bay has been always a good place for us.  We usually visit and stay in this hotel.  The exquisite service and outstanding amenities is truly commendable.  Keep up the good work.,5
"This bar is on the 57th floor! Amazing views of the gardens at the bay & we were lucky enough to see a laser show below. Cocktails are a bit pricey but the whole ambience, view & atmosphere are well worth it!  The infinity pool looks fab too but unfortunately can only be accessed by the hotel guests!",5
"Having been to Singapore countless times, I finally decided to take a visit to the famous infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands.   The hotel was nice. It has almost everything that I needed - the shops, TWG afternoon tea, and an indoor ""hawker center"" that serves my favorite dishes (i.e. yong tau too and sting ray). Most shops close around 11pm (which is much later than the usual mall) and some stores in the food court opens 24/7!   The view on the rooftop was also nice. The drinks were great and the ambiance was divine. While everything was great...I must say I did not enjoy the infinity pool as much as I would like to. The pool was overly crowded - loud and noisy! I certainly understand that it is a popular spot but really wish we could have some peace and quiet during our…",4
"Friendly staff and helpful since arrival begin, fast check-in and fast luggage's delivered.  We enjoyed Club benefit at Club 55 with a great view to spend an hour with coffee or wine. Unique rooftop pool always a lots of peoples but is still space to enjoy, and observation deck to enjoy Marina amazing views just a short walks.  Various venue selections to have breakfast, and each venue have an own outstanding impress.  Got high floor room with the excellent view of the bay and city, and beautiful city lights and sky at night.  In room comfort and amenities are well organised.",5
"This hotel is indeed giving a fantastic city view, either from the room or from the pool. During the night, you could just sleep with the lights of the city while opening your curtains. Its so romantic. The infinity pool experience is quite awesome even though it was bit windy yet you can get exquisite view. Despite all of the sceneries, you need to be patience during the check in process as this hotel is quite crowded. We took almost an hour queue. Even after the queue, we were a bit disappointed because we still needed to wait to get non-smoking room. Yet, we decided to take what ever room that available as we have already tired due to the commotion. The experience turn out nice as the hotel's staffs did several check to ensure that our room was clean enough with no cigarette…",4
"Although it is extremely expensive, this is the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in.  The service is excellent and they can't do enough for you.  The bedrooms are fantastic and the bathrooms are extremely luxurious. Since this was a very special Birthday and Anniversary we decided to really spoil ourselves and opted for a room on the Executive Club Floor.  This meant the use of their Club Lounge which had a view to die for!!  It also meant we could have breakfast, high tea, and drinks there throughout the day.  A holiday of a lifetime!",5
"The Hotel itself is a experience. Once in a life time  you should go there. The service is friendly and helpful. The rooms are very good and the pool is amazing. If you go to the roof top bar, witch is not related to the Hotel, say to yourself, it is for the night view over Singapore and enjoy it. It may be have a small different to the hotel....",5
"One of the most iconic hotels in the world.  Rooms are beautiful, location is fantastic and views are second to none.  Unfortunately service has gone down hill over the past few years,  costs have gone up and the support staff have gone down hill.  All in all,  a fantastic hotel with unfortunate nickel and diming that diminishes the value.",2
"Just spent 4 nights in a Club room here and all I can say is WOW. I arranged transfers to and from the airport with MBS and was pleasantly surprised to be met at the gate by 2 representatives and escorted through the terminal to Immigration and Baggage collect. We were then escorted to our driver and were swiftly on our way. Once at the MBS we were greeted by Tressa and taken to our room where she processed our check in. Our room was on the 46th floor and overlooked Gardens by the Bay, which we enjoyed watching from our balcony. The room was more than we expected and the bathroom was wonderful, with both a free standing bath as well as a walk-in shower. Everything was electronic and controlled by the push of a button. That night we went to Club 55 for Pre Dinner drinks and…",5
Must stay once in a lifetime at least. Room is good with nice view and amenities. Pool is good. Spago breakfast is average. This is the last week for sky on 57 justin quek restaurant. We managed to dine there for good last memory. Stay there two nights and was upgraded to grand club room at 14th floor. ,4
"I am really appreciated everything here , not only Elegant room with great panaramic view but all staffs at the front desk , the Club 55 incuding the doorman, all are very friendly and provide helpful service.  Honestly , I believe they all are well trained for serving every single customer.  When I walk pass the Pool Access just only to get to the Club 55 .  The staff walk and lead me to the elevator herself .  To be honest, I am very impressed on overall hotel and services.  My mom, her friends and I have an unforgetten time with good memoriable night at Straite Suite Room indeed.  This is my second time staying at Marina Bay Sand , and I definitely choose here for my next visit.",5
Room was huge view of the gardens during the day and night fabulous couldn't asked for better. The pool in itself was a once in a lifetime experience. Hotel was close to everything has its own metro stop easy to navigate.,5
It is rare to have a perfect stay... perhaps 1 in 100 stays- but my recent stay at MBS' Club Room did it.  Wang Qian who is my housekeeper in-charge puts heart & soul behind her excellent work. While the rest of MBS' team from SkyPark to Infinity Pool to Club 55 to Banyan Tree to the gym to the security guys worked seamlessly together to provide a perfect stay.  Excellent!,5
"Room is very big, clean and new. Beds are very comfortable and soft. They have automatic curtains as well, impressive. View along the Gardens by the bay is beautiful!! Bathroom is very huge!, perhaps the most I am impressed with.  Everything in the mini bar is chargeable, once you lift up any item from the fridge, even not consuming it will automatically be charged to our room so be careful on this. You must go to the Swimming pool at the roof top, just for the sake of enjoying the magnificent view! But quite stressful though because of too much crowded at all times so not good for relaxation. All are competing to get seats. They only allow maximum of 2 adults + 2 kids (per entry, per room number). Service was excellent! They always approach you by name, and very attention to…",5
I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a conference in April. We had the meetings in the conference center and accommodations at the hotel.  My overall impression is that this is a place where service and professionalism comes first.  The hotel in it self was of course wonderful the hotel is a majestic building overlooking the city and the sea. On the top floor you have amazing views as well as a pool and restaurants. The service level is high and you truly feel like you are the most important guest there. The rooms are very luxurious with everything you could possibly need to make your stay a pleasant one... and then some. I tried a few of the restaurants during my stay and they were all up to par with the ambition level. It is a once in a lifetime experience to sit on the 57th…,5
"This is a mega-production of hotel experiences! The pool is gorgeous, but with over 2500 rooms available at this hotel, you can imagine that pool is crowded! We were here for our anniversary and the staff upgraded our room, which was quite wonderful. Staff was super friendly and customer-focused. It's just that there are so many people it makes for a crowded experience. We went for dinner and what a maze that was...most things required waiting in lines! ",3
"Exactly as expected, the room view towards city was absolutely amazing, especially during the night. The room view towards the bay (i've seen it from a friend's room) is pretty unreal as well. If you're thinking between the two, I would probably opt for the bay one since you can have the city view from the pool area.  Speaking of the pool, it's exactly as amazing as you would think. It can get very windy up there and even though Singapore is a hot country 24/7, after dark it's very chilly near the pool.  I've had room service for some overpriced and totally average food. Service was quick and professional though.  I would 100% recommend this for at least 1 night. The experience is really unforgettable.",5
Marina Bays Sands is a must visit... The rooms ..the view from rooms...the hotel staff and the food... everything is extraordinary...The infinity pool is just breathtaking.   Kudos to the entire management team. ,5
"Very nice hotel to stay. The best is the unique view from hotel roof, especially during the night.  So if you are looking for a bar to have a drink then pick one of those roof bars, is is a memorable moment - very nice drinks & breath-taking view on the downtown. ",5
"We are fortunate in that we have family in Singapore and so we always get to stay with them.  This trip, we were going on to Bawah afterwards, we decided to stay at a hotel as they were out of the island. My wife had no doubts as to where that should be. That hotel with the three towers. What is it called? We found out. And booked it. Yes it is pricey but it is one of the must do's.  We arrived from the airport in a taxi, but to the wrong tower! A walk through the massive lobby to the right check in. A smooth check in, a confirmed late check out time, an upgrade, and then we were off up to the 33rd floor. Fantastic views over the financial district and a large room and bathroom. The lavatory is a little dated but the rest of the room was great. We went straight up to the sky…",5
"OMG, what can I say? My girlfriend and I decided to indulgent on a recent visit to Singapore for a night at Marina Bay. This is a MUST do and once in a lifetime opportunity. Whilst the security on the roof top is a little over the top, everything else was amazing. The place just buzzes, and is very busy - the views are nothing short of spectacular. If you can visit and spend a night there, you really should. It has everything you could imagine and more!",5
"I wanted to come here for a long time and I didn't get disappointed. There's a lot of people in the swimming pool surroundings but it's not very hard to get a chaise long and a good spot to see the amazing view. The hotel has everything, from a casino to a mall.  You can easily walk to gardens by the bay, artscience museum, do some shopping, eat and drink, and a lot more.  ",5
"What can I say, we have just returned from a 5 day stay in Singapore, two of those nights at Marina Bay Sands. Probably two of the best days I have ever spent in not only a hotel but on any holiday I've been on. The hotel, the pool, the location, the staff, rooms, entertainment, shopping malls, views and food are out of this world. I could type a 10,000 word review on how amazing, but all I will say is, you need to stay here at least once, even for one night. The infinity pool is as good as it looks on TV and you will not regret it, cannot wait to return.",5
"Love the view up here, you get to see a lot up here. If you got a local friend, ask he/her to come with you. It is much more enjoyable when you have someone telling you which is which :D The disign of the building is in a league of it's own. ",4
"i think , its the best hotel in the word ,,, we stayed 3 nights and enjoy everything . sky park in 57 floor was the best pool and had breathtaking views  we had great experience , our room in 12 stair had big balcony . and  decoration was very modern .  the garden bay park was the best and children enjoy it check in was fast breakfast was average for this huge hotel.....",5
Got a Surprise upgrade which made our trip once in a life time experience. In room Piano & Karaoke was my 2yrs kid favorite spot.Dogs are my kids favorite & towel Art made her dream come true.Stunning View & a great service. Overall it was trip filled with great Memory.,5
We stayed one night here while in Singapore and it was totally worth the expense due to the fabulous views of the city from the infinity pool! No pool will ever top this! There were 3 of us girls travelling to Singapore on our stop over to Bali and this hotel made our stop of extra special. ,5
"This is a bucket list item ticked off, great experience from beginning to end. from check-in to check out a great time. The rooms are spacious with great views, the service is excellent. Throw in the infinity pool, the views and the cocktails we will be back for sure. Make sure you add it to your list. Enjoy",4
This place is beautiful! Everything about this resort is amazing! The pool is to die for! And the Brie is spectacular!! The rooms are beautiful with everything finished to the finest detail! You have to stay here! Even if it's just for a night! ,5
"The stay at this hotel wasn't the best experience I have had in hotels. Very unwelcoming atmosphere. Yes, it's big and brash and the rooms are great, but together with the sky pool that's about it. Breakfast was very average, definitely will try somewhere different next time in Singapore.",4
"Let's just get this out of the way: the pool is every bit as spectacular as one would hope. But you have to pay for the privilege: access is only granted if you are staying at the hotel, and rooms are not particularly cheap. However, for one night or two, it is absolutely worth it, especially for the views during the day, or just sitting in the hottub to see the sunrise over the waters.  The rooms, like the hotel itself, are positively gargantuan, and cannot be faulted in the least.   Do yourself a favour and pamper yourself, treat yourself, to a stay here!",5
"We had the once in a lifetime opportunity to spend several days at the MBS, Singapore, on the last leg of a three country Asia vacation. Simply put, this hotel is an absolutely stunning sight to see.  I've been a few places in the world, but for any of you considering a stay in Singapore, I have to say that you've never seen anything like it.   First off, the accommodations are certainly on par with a luxury hotel.  We booked a Deluxe King room, which was roomy, high-tech and nicely appointed for such a large volume hotel, so no complaints there. The public areas are nothing short of amazing.  The Sky-Deck; Infinity Pool and countless other attractions around the hotel are stunning.   After doing a huge amount of research on the property prior to booking, I noticed a lot of…",5
We went to the roof top bar for sundowners to see the sun set and we weren't disappointed. You buy a band which allows you access and gives you some money towards your drinks. We had a morning margarita which was absolutely delicious and would highly recommend. The view was outstanding and well worth the ear popping lifts!! We stayed until after sunset which lets you fully appreciate the Singaporean skyline. Loved every minute of it and would say it's a must if you visit.,5
"Stayed again at Marina Bay Sands, this time with my hubby and child. As with my first visit, my family and I enjoyed our stay. The hotel is huge, but for me, it's not overwhelming.   Check-in was fast and I have to say, I was pleased with the personalized service the hotel staff gave us, because he went to the trouble of finding us a room with a great view of Gardens by the Bay. It was awesome, especially at night when you can also watch the lights and sounds show by the terrace of your room. Our room was at 3213, it was clean and all facilities were working.   Buffet food at The Rise was pleasant, service by the crew was very hospitable and warm. Infinity pool was crowded that time, though, but we didn't mind because we were there for the pool and view. Check-out was super…",5
Loved this hotel we stayed really to experience the pool up in the sky and was not disappointed. Location was perfect hotel as expected was beautiful. Staff attentive breakfast good. Everything you would expect Recommended.,5
My son bought me an overnight stay in a suite on the 51st floor. Absolutely fantastic. large comfortable rooms and views to put anywhere in the world to shame. it was just fantastic. Expensive but fantastic. The three tower building and infinity roof top pool on the 57th floor was breath taking. A visit to the roof top bar at night a real must and if you are a resident you get access to the viewing platform and the pool for free. Outstanding hotel which lived up to its reputation. You will love it if you like class style and something different.,5
"We stayed in December 2016 in this hotel. It was the first time that we were in Singapur. The room we stayed was a city view and the scene outside was wonderful.  There was water shows and laser performances in the evenings,  The pool on the roof was very exiciting; however it was crowded therefore we used it just for watching the scene and photograph. Also, the restaurants on the top was very delicious and the staff working was very calm. If we have a chance to go Sİngapur again, we will definetly stay again in this hotel. ",5
"This is a must when you stay in Singapore, the view from the roof top pool is amazing,  It's a very busy hotel, the rooms were fantastic, make sure you take plenty money.",5
I have never received a better treatment from a hotel. We were upgraded to a very beautiful suite with an amazing view to the city. The staff was very polite and professional and made us feel comfortable. The hotel itself is a must-see and a trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete without a visit to Marina Bay Sands.,5
My room was facing Garden By Bay and I watched the whole light show sitting comfortably in my room. Worth Money . Rooftop pool stole the show. Best was to visit Deck View at the different timings and watch Singapore in different shades,5
"Can spend sufficient days in hotel itself !  U can travel through hotel itself ! Enjoy th infinity pool on rooftop ! Shop with the top brands , enjoy 23 different type of food ! Enjoy the exhibitions in art science museum. Enjoy your room view !",5
I've stayed here twice a year apart and you can't help but be impressed by the amazing architecture of the hotel. Sadly it isn't really walking distance from the more popular tourist areas like Clark's Quay. The pool is truly stunning and make sure you head up to the roof if you're staying here. Likewise the rooms are excellent with either a city view (1st visit) or a garden and coast view (2nd visit).,4
"Stayed at this hotel for only one night. The staff was very friendly but the room was nothing special considering the price. We were supposed to have breakfast in the room package, in the morning we went to the restaurant on the roof top and a lovely lady showed us to our table. After a few minutes another lady came telling us that breackfast was not included in the price. Finally we the issue went solved however totally ruined our meal even it was delicious. Think I will not return",3
"My husband and I, along with 6 other couples, spent 2 nights(May 3 & 4, 2017) at Marina Bay Sands.  We all chose the club level rooms and were highly satisfied with our decision.  Not only did we have spacious rooms with a beautiful view of the marina, but the amenities included in the club room were fantastic.  We were served a delicious buffet breakfast in Club 55, open from 6-11am.  Then afternoon tea was served from 2-4pm.  This consisted of a plentiful assortment of sandwiches, scones, fresh fruit, dessert, coffee, tea, soft drinks, juices & more.  This was lunch for us.  Then from 5-7pm  we went to happy hour which consisted of heavy hors d'oeuvres, cheeses, smoked fish, fruit and all the alcoholic drinks you wanted.  After this we did not need to go out for dinner. …",5
"We decided to have a 2 night stop over in Singapore before our trip to Vietnam. We chose Marina Bay Sands as this hotel was recommended to us.  We booked the deluxe city view room. Walking into the hotel was super busy, while waiting to check in staff were offering  juice and mini cornetto ice creams.  Walking into our room we were impressed, the view was amazing the bathroom looked clean.   We went straight upstairs to the pool, upon arriving we were sent back to our room as we only had 1 room card that was not working and they would not let us in. We were not advised at check that each guest had to carry a card to be let in the pool. Once back into our room we could not get in and needed to call guest services to let us back in and had to wait for a new card to be issued to…",2
This hotel is amazing! Everything is 5 star rated and they own it! The infinity pool on the roof top is to die for and the Gardens by the Bay show is mesmerizing! This hotel is directly connected to the subway system of Singapore and it has a massive international 5 star underground mall. Rooms are 500 dollars a night. It they are worth every single dime. The hotel is a group of 3 colosal buildings together.,5
"We had a brief stay over the weekend at MBS. The room we had was pretty standard, but the view facing the Singapore Gardens by the Bay was spectacular. Being a 5 star hotel I was quite disappointed that their bell boy didn't even greet us in the morning as we were waiting for the lift. I would expect that's standard practice to always greet your guests.  As for checking out , their service was top notch. They was a long que, but they had a lady tht comes to the line to assists quests to check out electronically. That is if you don't mind not having a receipt, after all they have already swipe your credit card at the time of check in. It was a great stay at MBS and yes I would definitely stay there again 😘",4
"MBS is the most famous hotel in Singapore. Though the hotel is very fancy, the prices frankly are too high. I personally think its better to go to a less famous hotel as for the same price, the quality will be better. Service will be more luxurious.",3
"We stayed here for 2 nights on a short break. We chose the hotel because of the famous rooftop pool and views, which is amazing, however everything else was average and not worth paying the ridiculous room rates.  We checked in late in the evening, and were checked in quickly however when we got to our room we were massively disappointed. We had been given a room on the 2nd floor overlooking a road, it was noisy, underwhelming and we were gutted after having paid so much for the hotel (and booking directly with the hotel rather than a discount website or Expedia etc) we thought we would have had a room with at least a bit of a view! I went back to the check in desk and spoke to a really lovely member of staff who found us another room, which was on the 40th floor so a much…",1
Staying at the MBS was a must for me in Singapore.   It is a great hotel with large rooms and spacious bathrooms.  The signature rooftop pool is a experience not to miss but it is very small in relation to the number of guests the hotel is designed for and therefore very crowded. Forget to have a swim in it as it is absolutely packet with people taking selfies in every imaginal way.  The lobby if you can call it that remembers more of a busy airport or congress center as the place accommodates much more then just a hotel.  It is definitive worth staying there for a few nights on a stopover just to get it of your bucket list but for me once was enough and as frequent visitor to Singapore rather stay at some of the other luxury hotels this great city has to offer.,4
"From Concierge to Check In to Room was a great experience, all so efficient and very friendly.  We were also blessed with an upgrade, which was a once in a lifetime experience for us and one we will never forget.  The pool was crowded but what do expect as it is truly amazing.  We actually got up to see the Sunrise and were the first in the pool and it never really get packed. I also got to use the gym at 5am, yes 5am!  I had heaps to do and see in one day so I made the most of it.  It was one of the best gyms I have been too, loved it! We also got to use the shower facilities after check out to prepare for our flight home to London. The shopping mall is also another experience in itself, yes its full of Very Exclusive Stores but great for window shopping.  Take it for what it…",5
"Spending the long weekend in Singapore due to my horse racing on the Sunday I decided to spend one night at the Marina Bay Sands. Firstly due to never staying there before (normally I stay at a different hotel) and secondly one of the other owners was staying there and we were catching up for dinner at Marina Bay that night. Well to me this hotel is a mix of average and excellent. Firstly it is very touristy being there are people everywhere, so it is not a good hotel if you are looking for a relaxing place to stay. Luckily I got there before the rush and pre-completed the form for the VIP reception. Nothing very VIP about it but they did provide a room before check in which i was very happy about. The pool yes is excellent and is the highlight but once you have been there it is…",3
"As a hotel, Marina Bay Sands is very average and far from luxury - at least to my definition. Actually, it's just its original design and roof pool that make it worth a visit. Although I had a premier skyview room on the 49th floor, it was rather a disappointment to me. The main (and surprising) drawbacks were as follows:  1. The bellboy was very impolite - he asked us importunate questions about our stay and where we would be going to after leaving the hotel. I think interrogation is none of his business - is he a CIA agent or what? He's there to bring our luggage in, not to ask excessive questions. 2. The toiled had no bidet seat, no bidet shower or no bidet bowl. Does the hotel management expect their guests to neglect their personal hygiene?? 3. The room was very cheaply and…",3
"We went to the Marina Bay Sands to check out the amazing architecture, but instead we were impressed by the variety of shops and restaurants in there. A shoppers' paradise and everyone could find something in one's liking.",4
"Overpriced in my opinion, the pool was overcrowded and the service was mediocre. For the money you spend you could get treated like a king/queen in a neighbouring hotel.  The hotel staff are used to tourists and guests, they don't care how they treat us because at the end of the day people will always come for the pool and to say they have done it once.  Breakfast buffet was $100 for two, make sure you ask if it's included in your reservation, they don't bother to tell you when you check in. Disappointing & we won't be staying there again.",3
"5/19晚上10點多在游泳池拍照時手機不慎掉入泳池外的水溝裡，有一位名字叫Ryan的工作人員得知後很積極的幫我撿手機馬上爬到另一邊淺下去撿起來，事後還很關心我們，態度很好，讓我們印象很深刻，很感謝他，good job!!  19th May, 2017 around 10:30pm me and my friend go to the swimming pool at the roof we are taking picture, but accidentally my phone drop into the gutter out of the pool, I go to find Ryan immediately and he jump into the water and save my phone, really appreciate to him. Even though he say it happen daily.",5
"Booked MBS with friends to see the countdown fireworks and stuff on the 31st.  Pricey (even by Singaporean standards) but well worth it.  We managed to get a good room thank to a friend whose parents regularly visit the casino, the cityscape can be seen clearly and we had an unobstructed view of the festivities.   My friend tried the room service, and the food was delicious. But then again, pricey. I guess you get what you pay for!",5
"A 5-star hotel located next to Marina Bay Convention Center and Shopping Center, with superb view of Gardens at the Bay.  However, long queues at the check-in and check-out counter. I think it took them over ten minutes to process my check-in and check put, when I had verified the charges with the front desk one day before. It is possible to do an express checkout only if one did or use minibar and make any charges on the room. This doesn't apply to many guests so very few used the express check. To avoid queues, pay the nigh before.  There is no bathtub in most standard rooms which is surprising for the 5-star prices charged to guests. ",4
"The hotel is like a holiday in itself, so much to do and see..highlight of our honeymoon! The infinity pool is an evening to spend watching the sunset, the casino is huge and the mall is endless. The city view was unforgettable!",5
"I think without staying in MARINA BAY SAND your trip of SINGAPORE is incomplete. Excellent hotel with best and fast service,Delicious food, lots of activities and warmth Hospitality.Best attraction are INFINITY POOL on 57 floor and OBSERVATION DECK.  Always plan your Singapore visit with at least one night stay in MARINA BAY SAND HOTEL.  EXCELLENT HOTEL. ",5
"A group of friends and I stayed here in March. It is quite a spectacular place with good size rooms and a stunning infinity pool on the top floor. Personally, i would not rate the hotel as high as other 5 star hotels in terms of quality of the rooms and it is quite pricey. However, this is Singapore and everywhere is expensive. The surrounding area is fantastic and the pool area and retaurants on the top floor are fantastic in the night time.",4
"We went to Singapore for a conference that was being held at the Marina Bay conference centre and stayed on after the conference in the hotel for a total of 7 nights.  The hotel is huge with over 2,500 rooms.  Whilst the service could not be faulted it was very impersonal and aways busy.  The pool deck was so crowded it was hard to find a lounge and whilst the views were just spectacular it was so busy it just wasn't relaxing at all.  It was also very expensive - $14 singapore for a beer at pool deck. The breakfasts were great but also expensive ($50 head) and after a week of a full on buffet breakfast  (from a choice of three different resturants) we were looking for something more simple.  The hotel is very conveniently located next to the underground railway network and a…",4
"The infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands was on my bucket list and the only was to get to the pool is to stay. I had heard that the hotel could seem very crowded and service wasn't always great. The pool is a must see definitely worth one night to get to see and experience it. The service was hit and miss... We had breakfast the first day at Spago, there was a line for a table, the service was slow and average, the buffet ran out of everything regularly and no one seemed concerned about restocking it - not impressed. The next morning we went to Rise the selection of food was better and was all freshly stocked... The servicewasnt very friendly but they got the job done. It wasn't all bad service we had an amazing check in experience and as we were in a penthouse suite we had access…",3
"We were in Singapore for three nights and we didn't want to spend all the money to stay at this hotel every night - so we just sprung for it one night and spent the other two elsewhere. But wow!   Not only was the pool fantastic, which it was, but this is in a really nice area as well. We had a beautiful room with a nice balcony facing the bay. We spent the day in the pool and walked to a restaurant nearby. So much to do nearby and all easy to walk to. Really a great day!",5
"We stayed in Singapore in February this year and spent 2 nights at the Marina Sands. It is an iconic hotel in Singapore with its triple building with an infinity swimming pool on top of the building shaped like a ship with a restaurant and bar. The view from here f the city especially at sunset is magnificent. The hotel has its own casino and a shopping centre attached to it, which is huge and caters both for the high end products, and also middle of the range products. It has its own local food court. There is laser light show on most days at night and is worth a watch. The service is very good and has a variety of cafes and restaurant. Most definitely a visit to this hotel when in Singapore even if you are staying elsewhere in Singapore.",5
"Its definitely once in a life time stay. No luxury traveller worth their while can get away with saying that they've missed out on this fine piece of hotel asset. The pool and show off quotient aside, the hotel is hardly a great stay. The staff is snooty and very very anxious. For e.g. if you are entering the pool area and before you can even take out your room's second key to swipe in, the staff would pounce on you like i've never seen before in a place of such prestige. In another example, the buffet staff literally threatens you with double billing on buffet if your kid as much as picks a fruit piece from your plate! Being new age and so modern cannot compensate for lack of grace. Forget any warmth whatsoever and yet, do give it a stay just for the show off badge sake!",3
We had been stayed one night here.it was really worth it.its marvelous pieces of modern architecture must visit iconic place of singapore. Rooms check in everything was smooth and superb As we had check in after 3 pm but they give us early check in by jiju. Best part of marina bay is its infinity pool.its really amazing and great to swim. Really myself and my kids enjoyed alot.,5
"Expensive but beautiful view I must admit. Pool are very crowded, a lot smaller than the pictures. Receptionist gave me a very good service. But otherwise it's all basic. I think it's very good for family but not when your flying solo.",3
Taking a swim above the clouds at the famous @marinabaysands its always been a dream of mine to stay in this iconic hotel and swim in the best infinity pool in the world. Thank your for the hospitality and stay that I'll cherish always. Hope to visit this hotel again.,5
Stunning hotel we had standard room overlooking the gardens.  These rooms have balcony so you can watch the light show at night from 7.45.  The pool is I would think one of the best in the world.  I have been to a few and none are as good.  The view is breath-taking.  Overall we had a wonderful night only stayed the one.  Its expensive but you get what you pay for.  Rooms are very good and great beds.,5
"The Marina Bay sands is known for its incredible pool. Yes, you do need to be a guest to use the pool. There is security and key-access gates.  The photos show you how lovely the pool is, but don't be fooled - the pool is packed 24/7.  The rest of the hotel is rather luxurious too - so be prepared to pay for it. The prices of most/all services in the hotel match the price of the accomodation itself.  So if you are splurging a little to visit this hotel (and of course, the pool) - don't be surprised by prices in the restaurants and spa. The hotel is about luxury!   Overall I enjoyed my stay. I had the room, and chose not to up grade for a view. I was shocked to find we had an incredible view of the gardens by the bay and the ocean.  I imagine the views upgrade would face marina…",3
"This is not my first time staying at MBS but my first time trying the club room (City View). The room is of course much more spacious and comes with a deep spacious bath tub, separate shower and toilet, better quality bathroom amenities and a Nespresso machine. I find the in-room lighting controls a little finicky - one of the buttons doesn't seem to be working. Cleanliness standard was quite good - the only thing we could find fault with was the table was not wiped after clearing the dirty dishes.  I think the club room is worth it if you plan to spend most of the day at the hotel, have a good appetitie for western style bites/canapes and a taste for alcoholic drinks. There is so much to do - breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktail and canapes at Club 55 with its gorgeous views of…",5
"My son and I had a business trip which we combined with little holiday, and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands. Hotel great but very busy, especially as new year celebrations at same time, and service a little slow with long queues. We had few meals at the hotel which were excellent and also ate at the various restaurants on offer at the adjoining mall. Room standard but perhaps little under opulent for 5 star, but I am sure it is typical for Singapore as standards vary country to country. The gym was well equipped and not too busy and the sky pool and facilities excellent. I found drinks at sky pool very expensive, but our exchange rate not great. Highlight was having few suits tailored and delivered to the hotel, and they were perfect. Finally restaurants are expensive but worth…",4
"We went to MBS while on an Asia trip and spent 3 nights. The view at the top is stunning and worth the money but...avoid weekends if possible as the pool ends up in a forest of selfie sticks. Rooms were ok (had one on higher floor) but not really surprising in terms of interior design. Gym is really small considering the huge size of the place (...and you will get lost on he way there, I bet). Breakfast next to pool was ok even though staff a bit unfriendly.",4
"We had booked suite room at 45th floor. Room was amazing, it had very well decorated  rooms. The living room had dinning table which can cater six peoples. Decor of the living was very calm and relaxing. The bedroom has a writing desk with a comfortable chair. The view from our Bedroom room was stunning. We were able to see the skyline of Singapore. Marina Bay Sands is must if you can afford the luxury which they offer. Ofcourse the pool at terrace is awesome and it justifies its access to the person who stay there.",5
"We arrived hot and tired. The staff at check in processed us quickly gave us an upgrade and we settled into a lovely room. The pool and views are amazing, the hotel easily accesses shopping, gardens by the bay and other attractions. Really enjoyed our 2 nights here. Room tip: if you can get a higher floor with views over gardens by the bay. The night show is spectacular looking from the room",5
"We stayed in the 8th floor facing the gardens. The room is spacious as well as the bathroom. Amenities are complete though made of low quality materials.   For a pricey nightly rate, as well as 'a-must-go-to-when-in-Singapore, I would have not expected dipping on a cold water on a windy rooftop pool.   The view is a must-see, so if you're just after the view, I suggest spend your $700 on the restaurants and bars on the same level, and you will feel more value on your money.  Nevertheless, it's good to experience but not to repeat. ",4
"You get what you pay, but need to improve the toilet & hotel lobby, the lobby too crowded lack of waiting area, the toilet doesnt have bidet",4
"Everything is nice but way too expensive. I've stayed in better hotels for less than what i paid at MBS. I found a huge cockroach (alive) in my bedroom (disgusting). Also, I saw a guy MASTURBATING in the jacuzzi where I and 5 more people were. Yes, you read right!!! I got out of there to report him and when we (security, my family and I) came back the guy wasn't there anymore. Later the called me to let me know that the cameras caught some weird moves in the jacuzzi but unfortunately they couldn't find him. Soooo, obviously as you can imagine this ruined my stay at this hotel and after this i didn't feel safe anymore and I wouldn't stay there again just thinking about using that jacuzzi full of pee and semen better i'll give it a miss.",4
"This hotel is fabulously situated, between the river and the fantasy gardens.  The hotel is a classic having a ship-infinity pool on top of the hotel.  We were on one of the lower floors but even there the view was great, looking out on the fabulous fantasy gardens which can be easily reached from the hotel as can a large shopping mall adjacent to the hotel.  The hotel has a substantial buffet area conveniently located on the first floor.  And if your into buffets, there are half a dozen of Singapore's top ones within walking distance (located in other 5 start hotels).  This is obviously one of the most happening hotels in Singapore.  I highly recommend it.",5
"The rooms were nice!😊  What I like mostly was the infinity pool at the rooftop. And the mall inside the hotel.   It even has a man made river like (Italy) inside which made our stay fabulous! Haha. Although you pay a lot of money for the price of your stay. But if you have the money, treat yourself to a good hotel just like this one.😊",5
"We did stay for 2 nights, but except for the swimming pool experience the hotel offers nothing more than a good 4/5 star property would offer. you can get good views of the famous Singapore gardens...the trains are nearby..Please avoid the fountain show it is not worth missing your relaxation time ...visit the pool instead.",4
"What can I say about this place? Whole documentaries have been made about this titan of a hotel. Being a guest here is generally the only way to enjoy the skytop pool, and with the city of Singapore being such a picturesque skyline, it's definitely not to be missed. Not much swimming actually takes place here, but instead endless tourists taking photos and selfies. I was upgraded to a very high floor with a city view, which I would recommend. The rooms themselves are very luxurious but not more so than most other luxury hotels, although I did like the wow-factor of the curtains being mechanically opened automatically when we arrived at the room, revealing the incredible views. It's expensive, but if you can afford it, I recommend trying it at least once.",5
This was a great first stay in Singapore.  We came for the pool but overall enjoyed the variety of shopping and dining in the complex.  Great location and easy to get to most of the main tourist attractions.,4
"We recently stayed here for a couple of nights, and were really pleased we did. Great access to shops/restaurants.  Amazing pool, brilliant views, and actually really good service.  Would definitely stay again.",5
"If you wanted to see Singapore in the bird's eye view, Take the 57th floor of the MBS.   Breath taking view while enjoying their roof top infinity pool with the ambiance of the a first class resort. While there is only limited room number allowed to enter the pool area.  The place is great, the mall is downstairs, access to everything you need, the entertainment is by the bay, the dancing fountain show, the food bazaars.. The garden by the bay... is open 24/7. Almost near by this place!  Great staycation 💕💕💕",5
"1. Late check out is only at 12 noon! For additional late check out they offer an upgraded room at Sgd85++, so can have late check out at 1pm! So my room is the lowest grade along other room with hit price  2. Complimentary water in the room is limited to 2 bottles per day!  I'm staying not in a budget hotel,  am i? Additional water will be Sgd 4...i bet it will be plus plus  3. To go swimming to Tower 2 we have to go all the way down to the lobby where public crowd are passing by.  But, also far from impressed with the boy at the receptionist.  The reason i give 2 bullets not 1 bullet is : the guest service is quite helpful with the additional waters that finally complimentary as well as band-aids, n local phone lock. ",2
"If you plan on staying here, youve got to go all out. Pricey place to stay/ play and eat but all worth it in the end. Location is perfect for bars, restaurants and many more to do at your door step. Highlight of my stay is the end of the day relaxing by the pool with a priceless view.",4
"Briefly: you pay for the swimming pool, the view and the ability to brag about staying in the most recognizable hotel in the city.  This hotel does look great. It is well-known and is greatly located, having everything you need nearby. The Marina Bay area is the touristic center of Singapore, you can either walk around the bay, looking at the skyline, or get to the Gardens by the Bay, which is also a great place to spend a day. You might even get a room with a view at the bay and see a daily light show without leaving your room.  The pool is good. It is beautiful, providing wonderful view and is well decorated with plants, trees and flowers. The jacuzzis are warm and nice, providing a good view as well. However, the pool is overcrowded. It is divided in two zones - common and…",4
"We decided to spend 1 night here before our cruise as had lunch here last year. The views during the day and evening from the top level are incredible. The pool is amazing, and of course very busy all the time given the location. I have never seen so many people in a pool taking selfies! It is nice they have the ""adult"" portion, as there were plenty of families staying at the hotel when we were there. The property is massive with hundreds of rooms, so be prepared to wait for the elevator. The room was nice, but not fabulous as I had hoped for the price we were paying. It had a large deck off the room, but unfortunately no patio furniture to sit on and enjoy. The buffet breakfast had an incredible choice of items, and we paid a big price to have that included with our hotel stay.…",4
Marina Bay Sands. The name of the hotel itself is so great. Whatever I say about this hotel would be less. It cannot be explained through words because it's an experience of a life time. Super luxury hotel with an awesome view and amazing things to do at and around this hotel. The absolute luxury is to be at the Infinity pool at the 56th floor which has a spectacular view and one can see the Singapore city from the deck alongside. Amazing food. Amazing rooms and super staff.,5
"This is really an expensive place as we all know, but I recommend a night there to experience true luxury in terms of view, nightlife (Ce La Vie club and skybar rooftop) and obviously the pool. The pool should be visited twice in the morning for good picture and in the night for the breath-taking view. You really don't have to do Singapore Flyer when you stay here.",5
"Room as good, however given the price, expected more.  Facilities are good. However common areas quite warm - could be more generous in cooling the common areas. Pool can get very busy.  Be aware of the excessive late checkout charges ",4
"Visited a couple of weeks ago with my partner and a couple of friends. It really is all about that view and the infinity pool. The place really is massive and at time feels a bit like an airport or shopping mall or even a massive cruise ship. Room was good and food was pretty good too, chekin and out was smooth. It really is just the hoards of people and the delays for the elevators that would put me off returning",4
This is still by far the best hotel experience I ever had in my life. The infinity pool at the top says it all and the view of Gardens the Bay below and Singapore City is one of a kind. Would love to go back again and again.,5
"Expect people everywhere as there are over 2000 rooms but surprisingly the service is very good and everyone really knows what they are doing...  A must is a room with a city view, level 40 upwards will make a massive difference to your whole experience. The views are amazing and a visit to the pool at the top is a must but again don't expect the place to yourself.. just before sunset gives you some awesome photo opps... 🎥   Breakfast choice was superb and the breakfast team all very polite and attentive, even when serving a huge number of people.  Check in reminded me of going through passport control but again all part of the experience and ice cream and cold drinks are on offer..  I am sure that there are other hotels with a magnificent view in Singapore but a visit here is…",4
"Most amazing experience till today. Primer room with the sea view was just mind blowing and the swimming pool on the 57th floor, is something you should do for definite.",5
"We spent one night here on our travels through Asia. Although it is an expensive hotel, we felt it was a must to stay here, being a major landmark for Singapore. No problem with early check-in, luggage brought to our room immediately, very modern room. We found the staff helpful and pleasant. There is a huge shopping mall on the premises and the hotel is surrounded by landmarks such as the Flyer, gardens by the bay and the Museum. And of course the amazing infinity pool and observation deck. An expensive place but otherwise, we could not fault our stay. ",5
"Marina bay Sands is INCREDIBLE!!!!! If you can't afford spending your whole holiday there at least spend one night, it is affordable if you share the bedroom with your partner/friend/family. The service is just brilliant, fantastic bedroom with breathtaking views on both side of the city, I'd recommend the Gardens by the bay view. Highlight: THE INFINITY POOL (57 floor). It is unforgettable.  Floating in the world's largest infinity pool enjoying Singapore city view, drink and food.  There is also a skydeck and a huge shopping center. Must see. 10/10!!!",5
"We were very happy because we were upgraded when we arrived but it did not last. The room was beautiful but there was an awful smell in it. For some reason, the pipes in the bathroom brought us the smell of the toilets of the other rooms. When we took showers, there was water everywhere outside the bathroom. We had  to call the room service twice to ask them to prepare the bed for our daughters. When decided to go to the infinity pool and that was the worst thing by far. There was another terrible smell in the corridor but different from the poop of our room.  The pool itself is really ugly. Of course, on the pictures, it looks lovely but when you are there, it is very narrow, the structures behind you (the part that you do not see the on these pictures) make you feel that the…",1
"This stay was probably the best overall experience we have ever had. Our room was a suite on the 47 floor tower 2 with access to Club 55. The room was quite large with a balcony, and the bathroom was huge. A bathtub, separate shower and separate toilet made it exceptional. The Bed and pillows were just perfect. Having access to a balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay was breathtaking. Club 55 food and drinks were first class. The pool deck was extraordinary, layout gave you magnificent views especially by night where the lights of the city were dazzling. This is one place not to miss, trust me.",5
Certainly an expensive and beautiful hotel that is worth 5 stars. The pool is lovely- definitely worth the stay for a night or two just to relax by it and see the views. The pool is very private and there is an adults only section. I was there with the other friends and we had a heat gone. The hotel is massive so it isn't incredibly exclusive but the staff are very friendly and the amenities are high class. The restaurants are very expensive so be prepared to drop extra $ on dining. One night we had apps at the Flight Bar and they were phenomenal- I recommend the duck quesadillas.,5
"If you want the best view in Singapore then this is the place to go. Although its VERY expensive for drinks etc the view is certainly worth it.  We went with friends of ours for a quite drink, which lasted the whole afternoon so you get over the prices of wine pretty quick. The place has a great atmosphere with a LOT of people enjoying themselves. Can be tricky sometimes to find a seat but standing up having a drink is not a problem. Cheers.",5
"Stayed in Tower 3 during my recent business trip, room slightly tired, but service was surprisingly good - as i have heard from several people that their service wasn't great. From check-in to room service, to check out, i actually found it very smooth and they were really friendly to me. Room service food was great. Would definitely choose this place again.",5
It was our family trip to Singapore. Its a must to visit this Hotel if you are planning a Singapore trip. it costs around 20 Singapore dollars to go to 85th floor(roof top) of this hotel. Its a magnificent view from here. Highly recommended,5
"We arrived in Singapore very early, and was greeted by an early check in which was a bonus. Once we had unpacked, we decided to check out the famous infinity pool and this did not disappoint. I was worried about reading the reviews of it being over crowded but it was actually quite quiet! However, this did get busier towards the evening. The views from the pool are absolutely incredible and worth paying the money to stay in the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone debating whether to spend the money to stay here. The otnly issue was that there was VAT added to our bill on check out which we were not aware of at time of booking the hotel.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is amazing - a majestic architectural masterpiece with a rooftop infinity pool as its crowning glory.  The rooms are spacious, stunning and immaculate, with automatic curtains that open onto the city views upon entering the room and an enormous bathroom.  Check in/out was effortless despite being extremely busy and the service was faultless.  Not cheap, but definitely worth it - also really close to the MRT, so getting around is really easy. My only negative (and it's minor) was that it felt rather impersonal - like we were ""just a number"".  This could be because we'd just come from a very small boutique hotel where we were greeted by name at every interaction to the enormity of MBS where such a feat would be near impossible. Nevertheless, now that I've stayed…",4
"Yes, we know about the iconic rooftop pool at the hotel. Yes, it has a casino. And, yes, there is some great high end shopping and restaurants. However, I just found the hotel too crowded everywhere you went. The lobby, the pool, the restaurants, and even the executive lounge which you had to walk and take two elevators to get to. There are a lot of hotel choices in Singapore, so after you've stayed here once to get your pic from the pool, stay elsewhere.",4
"We stayed here for one night and choose to upgrade to a Club Room which included access and breakfast in Club 55, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapes in the evening.  We had a very smooth check in and a special VIP check in desk and straight up to our room. Our room was very large, with a very comfortable bathroom. The decor however was not outstanding, nothing extraordinary about the room. In fact it had quite a musky smell like a previous guest had been smoking, we did advise reception but despite them adding an air purifier, it never really got rid of the smell.  The infinity pool was pretty much the main reason we stayed here. It really is a fabulous as it looks. And also very very busy!  Tip: get up early for sunrise for a much quieter experience.  The Club 55…",4
"We flew into Singapore to embark on cruise of Indonesia. The night before the cruise we stayed at this hotel. The hotel is massive and right up front be aware that you will never be alone. We had a club room so we were on a very high floor overlooking the gardens. There is a separate check in for club rooms so you don’t have to stand in the long desk lines. Same is true for check out. The view at night was spectacular.  The drinks at the Skypark, roof top bar, are pricey, but the atmosphere is electric and is one of the night spots in Singapore. Even with the size of the hotel the room was quiet and nicely appointed. The following morning we went up to the infinity pool at 6:00 AM, in the dark and we were not alone. (The pool gets incredibly busy in the afternoons.) I saw at…",5
"fantastic hotel, the swimming pool is amazing, the room is very good with excelent ocean views. excelent shopping and casino. I lo staff very professional, breakfast with variety and you can choose 2 or the retaurants. Singapore.........what a great city!!!!",5
"What a great experience with my family. We really enjoyed our 2nights stay at MBS. We arrived at 12nn and one of their staff assist us and allow us to check in early, Check in process is fast and no hassle that time. The room is big and love the bathroom setup. Our room has a fantastic view of the city. Let's go on their infinity pool on 57th floor. The view was stunning, though it is crowded if you go there around in the afternoon to till night. So i suggest you go there in the morning so you can enjoy the place. The hotel is little bit pricey but I didn't regret anything from the services we got.",5
"This hotel is amazing. full facility, mall, casino, flower in door at dome. Great hotel, good location.Amazing. Price is rather high but every spend is valuable. We are very satisfied stay this place. The people staff is polite.nice. Recommend this hotel to people with spend their time in singapore",5
"The best experience in Singapore, worth the price, the view is incredible, you can not benefit of the pool access as an outside guest. The buffet at the lobby restaurant is extraordinary at a good price since it is all you can eat type of place.",5
"We went from Singapore 2days ago ..nd i wana go to back again..everything was amazing🖒🖒.very clear nd tidy organization.lovely personal food.unforgetable moment's.thank you and see you again Alena Malikova ,Kveta Chuda",5
"While this hotel gives access to the infinity pool where you can have a spectacular view of Singapore, it was too crowded with tourists. Lacks of personal touch I would say. The buffet breakfast was very standard",4
"MBS is just FANTASTIC! Our experience was amazing.  We arrived at Noon and were kindly greeted by check in staff who afforded us early check in.  We stayed on the 38th floor (Garden View) and it was awe inspiring.  I could not believe how beautiful the gardens could be until I saw them from that height.  Every luxury is available to you within the hotel ( restaraunts, stores, bars, casino etc..)  It was amazing.    Then let me not forget the infinity pool on the 57th floor of the hotel.  Night views are nice but the view of the city and pool during the day (in my opinon) is so much better.    This is such a great place with fantastic staff and amenities.  Just be prepared to spend a bit of money for the stay.",5
"Stopping in Singapore on our way through to Australia, we had to stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands to have a dip in their rooftop infinity pool! We were staying over in Sentosa so it was a quick 15 minute journey to the hotel. We were dropped off at Tower 1-2 Lobby but were told we needed to check in at Tower 3. Check in was too slow in my opinion with a 15 minute wait then actually at check in we were there another 15 minutes. We had to pay for a late check out due to when out flight to Sydney departed, this cost half a day rate.  The room was really spacious and we had the sofa bed made up for the children, which was huge. We were also greeted with some cake due to the trip happening around our 10th wedding anniversary which was a nice touch for such a big hotel.  The pool…",5
"Wanted to see this iconic landmark despite the outrageous price. Infinity pool on 57th floor is something unique and will be remembered forever. Service 5 star level, executive lounge offering and services are worth while the extra cost of a club room or higher. Breakfast at rooftop terrace was also good. With the price I would not go here every time visiting Singapore but at least once in a lifetime must for Singapore visits. Also Gardens at Marina Bay that are just across the street are worth while visiting, light show 7.45 an 8.45 pm. Gym has reasonable equipment.",5
Incredible pool. If you go to Singapore you must see the infinity pool. You have to stay at the hotel Marina Bay Sands to have access to the largest and highest pool in the world. It is truly something you need to have in your bucket list. ,5
"The first time I stepped in to the infinity pool, it felt like you were in SELFIE CENTRAL. lol  Almost everyone in the pool were doing their duck lips poses.  I guess it's the place to be seen. Morning and early afternoon in the pool is more quiet.  Evenings are very crowded, which gives it a party atmosphere, especially with the electronic music blasting in the background. The room looks a little dated but was huge.  Bed was very comfortable.  We booked a room with a balcony and Gardens by The Bay view and it was wonderful. We were able to see the light show from the comfort of our own balcony.  If you can, upgrade to a Club room.  This will give you access to free breakfast in several locations, tea time and happy hour.  Well worth it, in my opinion.",5
"First things first: This hotel is amazing! My Dad and I had the pleasure of staying at this marvellous hotel for a week while visiting Singapore. We enjoyed every bit of it, especially the roof top pool. Check-in: We arrived at around 2pm and where surprised by a HUGE line of guests waiting to check-in. It ended up being almost an hour to check-in which in my opinion is a no-go for such an expensive and prestigous hotel. The room: Our room was located on the 21st floor and was facing the bay area. The views even from that level were better than expected and especially in the night when you turn the lights of in your room you can take in the whole beauty of this scenery. I must add that our room was spacious, especially the bathroom, and very clean and tidy. The beds were…",5
"Marina Bay Sands really is amazing!   The rooftop infinity pool is absolutely incredible and has the best views of the city. Surprisingly, it's not that busy either, due to it being restricted to hotel guests only.   The rooms are spacious and clean, with cool views from any direction.   I was impressed with the customer service from all staff. We were allowed to check-in before 9am when we arrived, which was great.  My only complaint is that - because of the massive number of guests - the lifts can be really hard to get. On one occasion, we waited half an hour for a lift to go down two storeys! This would be alleviated with access to stairs.   The location is really handy. There's cafes and restaurants down stairs, high-end shopping metres away and an easy walk to most tourist…",5
"This hotel is a must stay!! We stayed for 2 nights in a club room and it was wonderful. The rooms are extremely large with an incredible view. The club room includes access to the club55 lounge which gives you breakfast, lunch snacks and dinner snacks with alcohol from 5 - 7 so paying that little extra for the room really makes up for it with this access. The pool is Un- believable and definitely something you should do in your lifetime. Staff are extremely helpful , rooms extremely clean (BATHROOM IS HUGE, almost as big as the room) I have nothing bad to say about this hotel , one of the best places we have stayed..",5
"This hotel was developed by Las Vegas Sands Corp., which has its other properties in Las Vegas and Macao. You require a lot of planning in advance when you go to its famous world's largest rooftop Infinity Pool. Go to the Infinity Pool with your swimsuit, gown and slippers from the room on, with the room key, and, of course, camera(s). I have confirmed that it is okay to walk around in your gown and slippers. You have access to the Infinity Pool from all towers, but from the first floor, it is better to take direct elevators to the 57th floor from Towers 1 or 3. You need to change the elevators at the 55th floor if you use elevators of Tower 2. I found animal arts after house keeping, but varieties were limited to rabbit and elephant.  In its casino, you will find a crazy number…",4
"I stayed here for the Singapore Grand Prix. It is spectacular with fantastic service, too many amenities to mention. The highlight is the sky park infinity pool. Takes your breath away!! This is simply the best hotel in the world",5
"We stayed for just one night but we absolutely loved it! The pool is simply amazing, the buffet dinner was the best we have ever had, we will be back. The views from all rooms are amazing. A must do once in everyone's lifetime!",5
"Marina Bay Sands is truly an iconic building with an amazing view from the top! Can highly recommend booking access to the executive club, as the service and food is sublime! The roof top pool area offers an extraordinary view and is suited for both couples and families with children. ",5
"We stay for 1night the room was great with balcony and the view is the tree top, even though it was raining we still went to the infinity pool with the great view of singapore, staff very friendly and helpful ",5
"Nice experience to swim on the 57th floor but very crowded, especially at night. You can swim here if you stay in the hotel. One night is okay we think. There are quiter hotels for more nights. E.g. The Fullerton Bay. Also with stunning views.",4
"Awesome architecture and great view. Home of the the Singapore casinos, shopping, theatre, food for every budget from food court, bars, restaurants to Michelin Star. They thought about everything. Then there is the infinity pool and all the sky bars and not to miss c'est  la vie!",4
"What an amazing piece of architecture. The sheer size and hectic pace of the lobby was overwhelming. The lobby staff were amazing and kept the wait time down to an absolute minimum. The room was luxurious. The automatic opening of the curtains on entry to reveal Singapore is wonderful. Room was very clean and HUGE. Only downside is being unable to use the fridge in the room due to the strict minibar policy of ""if you remove it from the fridge (even if you put it back) you bought it"". The views from was amazing (37th floor) overlooking the garden so we saw the light show that evening. The infinity pool on the roof is an absolute must do. Your bar staff on the pool deck are simply brilliant. Even though the place was busy they addressed me by name after the first drink and were…",4
Awesome hotel. The infinity pool is definitely a bucket list item.  The views are great. Service staff fantastic.  Expensive... But well worth it. The casino is cool... But you need your passport to enter and exit. The variety of restaurants are great too,5
"A perfect location in Singapore to take advantage of the magnificent Gardens by the Bay and excellent access to the cruise liner, that we joined the next day. This hotel is well worth booking with many floor of luxury shopping including a casino. We spent many hours in airconditioned luxury admiring this micro city. Also, acess to the Metro is right there in the building.",5
"Beautiful area. We were amazed by the location, the hotel and service. Staff are very respectful, trained and professional. Loads of thing to do, easy access to public transport, shopping and restaurant. Would definitely go back.",5
"After booking Marina Bay Sands we read so many negative reviews about this place that we started to not look fwd to our stay. We had booked a club room. However we reached Marina Bay at 6am in the morning. There were no lines for checking in.  However, We did not get our room but we did get our key cards to access Level 57 and we changed & jumped into the infinity pool, just that experience made our pick of staying here totally worth it.   It was Dark when we went up , but seeing the sunrise was amazing.. At around 9am we rec'd a call that our room was ready. We got to our room, we were on the 49th Floor and had amazing views of the marina. The room was alright and nothing spectacular.   The access to Club 55 which was included in our room rate was awesome. Good Breakfast, High…",5
"We visited on our way from the UK to New Zealand, having a stop-over especially to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. The check in was appalling taking nearly a hour and a half and then the room we were allocated was poor to say the least. We booked two rooms which were supposed to be on the same HIGH floor one facing each way.  What we got was two low (3 & 4) rooms in different towers. The rooms were a good size but noisy because of the highway and with absolutely no view of anything except the highway. I am glad I went but I won't go again without an absolute guarantee of decent rooms.  ",3
"When i told my dad that i was staying at the MBS he fell from his chair and looked at me with a ""the student beat the teacher"" kind of look. I only spent one night there, it was actually the first night of my honeymoon. Out of the three weeks of vacation, it is the only hotel that did not have the curtesy to have even the smallest attention. You know, the swan shaped towels, some flowers, a complementary bottle... nu - uh. Since the checkin lady had learned from us that it was our honeymoon (even though the agency definitely told them), she smiled and said she would send up a gift. WOW! i wonder what this fancy place will have up its sleeve for the newlyweds!  Ten minutes later a guy brought up two nail-sized chocolates.  I mean the walk in the hotel is really something, you…",3
"With the bike sharing initiative, there are various bike sharing companies along the bay area. One can cycle from Marina bay sands to Garden by the bay and the way to Marina Barrage, passing by Satay club. Nice experience where one can see the skyline of the Financial ctr.",4
"I stayed at the MBS for one night several years ago while in transit back to NYC from Australia, and had a decent experience. On my latest trip, I thought we'd try something different (another, much higher ranked hotel on TA), and regretted it. After a day at the other property, I asked for them to ""release us"" so we could switch to the MBS.  The MBS is the ""it"" hotel in Singapore, no doubt. The views are astounding and the friendly staff put us up on one of the top floors when we checked in, even with one of the low room categories. Rooms are also decorated very nicely, clean and spacious.  The pool is of course a highlight, but also partying it up on the roof is a unique experience and one for the memory books.  Breakfast buffet is pretty good too.  Don't let its ranking on TA…",5
Absolutely stunning hotel.   Great views of the gardens and an amazing pool on the roof.   The only negative thing is that the drinks are VERY expensive small beer is £9! The room was beautiful and the hotel was immaculately clean. ,5
"I stayed here with my family in their Deluxe Room and it was lovely.  The rooms were not as spacious as the price tag we paid, but it was comfortable, clean and cozy. We got a beautiful 180 degree view of the Singapore skyline and the esplanade which was awesome! The bathroom was quite big, with a tub, and enclosed shower and toilet area.   Wifi is easily available upon check-in till check-out and can even be accessed throughout the whole hotel.  The hotel itself was quite central, easily accessible via MRT which can take you anywhere in downtown Singapore in minutes. There is a luxury shopping mall called The Shoppes, which we can find a few restaurants, just 5 mins walking distance and connected directly to the hotel. Although the famous Gardens By The Bay was just next door…",5
"First of all, the main reason to go is the amazing infinity pool on top. Other than that and its very cool architecture, MBS is really not remarkable as a hotel. For a 5-star hotel, the rooms are a bit plain, and I did not have a great experience with the service.   1. My brother & I check in. Checking in inexplicably takes about 30 minutes. No word about the pool or the rules about key cards.  2. We excitedly make the journey up to the top, we are refused entrance because we only have one key card, and we are told that we were informed about this two-key card rule (we were absolutely, definitely not). I guess I should add that they have some problems with people trying to sneak in, but we were treated really poorly and brusquely, as if we were little kids trying to break some…",2
"Apart from the Singapore Ritz Carlton, this hotel has one of the best views of the Marina Bay. It is also a one hotel that has everything in it, all the high end stores, a lot of good restaurants, nightime free light and sound show.They even have a skytop pool and park. But everything has its price. Rooms compared to the RItz Carlton rooms are a bit smaller and it is also a bit more expensive than other hotels in the Marina Bay area. But if you want a good view specially during New Year and during the National Day Parade which falls Aug 9 of every year, this is the best place to stay to watch the fireworks.But of course you pay slightly higher for rooms with a view of the bay.",4
"We stayed here on the last leg of our trip around Indochina, what an amazing way to say farewell to this wonderful part of the world. The hotel welcomes you in, charms you throughout your stay, & then remains firmly planted in your memory when you depart. We upgraded to a room with a view of the Gardens by the Bay; the evening lights watched from our balcony was delightful. The room, like the rest of the hotel, was first class, immaculately clean & extremely comfortable. However, the pool is undoubtedly the highlight - as evidenced by the sheer number of those who flocked to take selfies in this surreal location! As hotel guests, your room key gives you automatic access to the pool & observation area. A wonderful hotel which ticks all 'highest quality' boxes!",5
We were not residents but just went for a drink on the top floor. At night time this is just an amazing experience with views of the bay and the illuminated city.  Drinks are pricey but no more than you would expect for an establishment of this type.  Well worth a visit.,5
The pool is the biggest reason why we stayed and was well worth it.  The rooms are big and have everything you could possibly need and expect from a hotel.  Checkin process was speedy disputes being a big hotel and drinks were offered whilst we waited to check in,5
"Stayed 3 nights at MBS hotel and after seeing the hotel on a programme on the BBC we had high expectations.  Check in and Check out was like a cattle market, staff have no idea what is going on as twice they sent us to different queues because they were ""check in"" only and contradicting each other!  Rooms are very small and the ""double bed"" is at best a large single!  Service is non existent at this hotel!  Yes spending the day was an amazing experience but at the prices at MBS it is definitely not worth the money.  I would not return as nothing special.",3
rooms r spacious. v family of 4 stayed in 1 large room with 2 extra beds. breakfast was spread lavishly. mall is good n expensive. pool side is like swimming in heaven . spa is good n expensive.room sevice is good.,5
"I had an incredible stay in Singapore after a trip to Jakarta, and this hotel pulled out all the stops. The rooms were incredible, spacious, the bath and shower beautiful. The service was impeccable. The rooftop pool was incredible, with attentive and wonderful staff service. A truly incredible experience.",5
"I cannot possibly understand how anyone would have anything negative to say about this hotel. From the moment we checked in, our experience was nothing short of 100% luxury.   The lovely lady who checked us in was probably the single most polite, friendly member of staff i have ever encountered in a hotel. Considering how busy the hotel is 24/7, they do not skip a beat when it comes to their customer service.   Our room itself on the 39th floor with a full city view was extremely spacious and had everything you could need for your stay.   We asked for champagne glasses and an ice bucket, which were impressively delivered 15 minutes later, no problem at all.  The pool speaks for itself really doesn't it. Be sure to go up at night as that is when it really does have the wow…",5
"Singapore vacation par excellence is a staycation at Marina Bay Sands. Breakfast, lunch, dinner are excellent. The location, the room and the ambiance are excellent. Everything is truly superb and magnifico!",5
Hotel with great view of the city.  Very big room.  Infinity pool is just awesome.  Close to most of the places in city.  Big mall downstairs with branded stores (very expensive) and restaurants.  Breakfast downstairs at the rise restaurant ( not that great breakfast but lots of varieties) Overall great place to stay.  8/10 rating.  ,4
"My husband and I planned this short trip to Singapore on our way back from India to Sydney. I am sucker for good luxurious hotels and I booked my city view room at Marina Bay sands all though I was not 100% sure if it would meet my expectations. We reached way early around 8 am at the hotel and the regular check-in is post mid-day. They instantly checked us in to our room at 8. Impressed!!!! We spent an entire day inside the hotel as the hotel is massive with loads of shopping stores, restaurants, salons and what not. Service in this hotel is impeccable!!!! cant fault it what so ever! Taxis are always available outside of the hotel and apparently the hotel is connected to the railway station (we did not use this as taxi's were really cheap compared to taxi charges in Sydney)…",5
"Everytime I went to Singapore, I never stayed in this hotel even though I often went to the mall. But this time I tried to stay here. Actually the hotel is quite nice and has a beautiful view. Moreover, the swimming pool is very famous for it has a good spot for taking picture with the view of the city. The rooms are also clean. But for me, the hotel is too crowded and uncomfortable.  There are many hotels in Singapore with the same price but more comfortable. ",3
"This was a bucket list item place for me, because I have wanted to go visit the pool on the 57th story and all I can say is that it lived up the to hype. The view of Singapore was amazing. The hotel room was really big! Sorta like a Vegas hotel big. Bathroom was big and spacious. All I can say is this hotel was worth the money for me. I enjoyed going to the food court in the shopping center. And it is pretty convenient to get there with the MRT. Pretty close walking distance to the Singapore Flyer but if you are already staying here at the hotel might as well go up the rooftop and enjoy unlimited time enjoying the view.",5
"I was here for two nights and if I'm not using the pool, would have found this hotel to be an OK choice. The rooms is spacious, but you can definitely see it's age with wear and tear on furniture, like peeling varnish. Not sure if this is considered luxury, as it's definitely not a four seasons - and the Bellagio in Vegas feels more luxurious than this; I'd simply label it as 'superior tourist class'.  The lighting of the room was in a soft yellow hue that is very soothing, but the curtains that is electronically controlled has a design flaw as the edges do not block out any light as it's not flushed with the wall, so everyday at 7am, the bright sunlight (especially if you face the sea) will shine through the line of a gap and blast it on your eyes - perhaps nature's way of…",4
"Just amazing .. everything ! Perfect room , view, service and unreal swimming pool ! Worth it every cent ! All the complex with the shopping center and the gardens by the bay at the back where to enjoy the light show is fantastic ! ",5
We dropped up to the 57th floor for a spectacular view over the city.  The bar and restaurant was very busy but very helpful staff found us a table for the 4 of us to enjoy the best Singapore Sling and a great view.  Full marks for making non-hotel guests welcome.,4
"This was our 4th stayed on this hotel. Overall satisfied with the service and cleanness of hotel & room. The infinity pool is must visit place for the stay including the family Jacuzzi. This was our 1st time to use the children pool for our 10 month old baby gal.   The location is very near to airport with approx. 17Km or 20min to/from airport. It is also about few minutes from Bugis Junctions and China town.  On morning/evening, can jog at 'gardens by the bay' and children's garden that worth for visit that within the walking distance for good exercise.",5
This hotel is so over-the-top unbelievable. Parts of it reminded me of Vegas hotels but without any of the over-the-top Decor or gaudiness. Our room was beautiful and clean and the view of the skyline of Singapore was beyond incredible. The pool area is rather cramped but it is like nothing you will ever experience anywhere else. Be prepared for lots of young women posing for lots of Instagram worthy pictures :)  Attached to the hotel is a tremendous mall that has everything you will need and at points we had to make ourselves leave the hotel to go experience the rest of Singapore.  I have no doubt my mind that we will return to the Marina Bay Sands. ,5
"this place is absolutely awesome you will be 1000000000% blown away when you go to the rooftop pool its a gem of a hotel and its close to everything , the shopping centre under the hotel has gondola's to take you shopping along the canal in the centre of the mall ,,,, PERFECT ",5
Decided to spend our last 2 nights 3 days at the Marina Sands. So glad we did. Arrived mid morning and were lucky to get an upgraded room. Not high up 8th block 2 but still a lovely view of the gardens and a balcony. The rooms are large and stylish. Big bathroom double vanity with a shower and bath enclosed in glass. Every day had the towels made into an animal. Cute   Ate at both Wolfgang Puck restaurants. Expensive but worth every cent. Did we enjoy the vibe at the pool on the 57th floor. Sat after dinner until late admiring the view. Cost me extra to keep our room as our homeward flight is very late. Loved the hotel. The casino and all the shops. Not one bad thing to say. Recommend it highly ,5
Just came here for a visit. Did not stay at the hotel.  We skipped the observation deck and went up to the bar elevator to the bar is free. 2 cocktails was $60 Singapore dollars. Very pricy but paying for the amazing view I guess.  Incredible views over the city and harbour. Would highly recommend a visit,5
"My husband and I stayed in a Club King which had views of the Gardens By The Bay.   What can I say - absolutely amazing... We got buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes and drinks all included in the special Club 55. Worth every cent for the upgrade, we didn't even need to buy any food! The food on offer suits all appetites and is fresh and beautiful.   The mattress on the bed is like sleeping on a cloud - SO comfortable.   The bathroom - shower and bath are SO beautiful and the room just has this beautiful smell when you enter - almost a dull floral smell..  The reason we paid the ridiculous amount to stay here was the pool - and it does not disappoint. You can only access the pool if you are a guest of the pool which is fair because it gets SO busy anyway.   I didn't…",5
"Well we were afraid MBS would be like Atlantis dubai a too big commercial amusement park/zoo and not a 5 stars hotel  We were wrong, we were a bit unlucky at check in only one at club/suite check in desk and a customer in front with a lot of questions and so it took 30 min to be our turn, but Mr Edmund General Manager made that up for us thank you so much. We stayed at a grand club view for 2 nights and then 2 nights at the orchid suite both amazing but if you can effort it do the suite  Amazing club breakfast amazing staff everywhere so professional  Breakfast, tea time and drinks at the club was just perfect and worth every dollar The pool is a must Ofc , a lot of ppl but there is always sun beds available, prices are ok compared to it's a 5 star hotel and pool service and so…",5
Just excellent. Nothing else to say. This is an amazing hotel. The rooms were big with anice bathroom. The pool on the top floor is just amazing. Ths light show at night is awsome. Expensive but worth it.,5
"It was a much anticipated staycation, staying in the much acclaimed hotel with splendid view and infinity pool. After two days of stay, the it is TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT! We booked 2 rooms, we managed to get the first room at 2.30pm. However, We only managed to get our second room at 4.45pm after several phone calls to enquire about when the room will be ready.  For the price paid per room, our conclusion is: one third paid for room, the other two third for the infinity pool and sky deck, which we had to share with public. The pool is always crowded regardless of the time. I tried to order something to eat and drink at the pool. The server told me to wait, but never came back, went to serve other foreigners instead although I was just next to them.  Some staff were,in my personal…",1
Check in was quick and easy. Stayed at very high floor. Got 3 key cards so that 3 of us can go to the pool. Eat at Spago and love it! We will be back! Enjoyed our stay in the hotel - spent most of our time in the pool! (Though nothing special in the room.),5
"I booked a Grand Club King room for a one-night staycation to celebrate my husband's birthday together with our 2 young daughters (ages 5 and 6). Booking through the official website was a breeze and my emails for requests were answered professionally and promptly. There was also a text message from the hotel sent a day before our stay to get information from us to speed up the check in process.  On the day of check in, we had a hard time looking for the Shoppes (self park) car park. This self-park car park costs $8 for 24 hours for hotel guests. If you choose to park at the hotel towers, that will be valet parking that costs $15 per day. So make sure you find the correct car park, we managed to find the car park after asking a few security staff at the drop off points.  From…",5
"You can go to the rooftop bar free. But then you will pay 25 buck for a cocktail. Why? The non alcoholic ones just have juic, so why so much? The place is great and well located, but even a well off person feels like a pauper here. The staff were nice.",3
"Excellent place for a quiet time and drink, we was there in couple and all people was clever, only mlittle waiting time for the service and not very cool drinks, nice vew over the water sea but take a ombrella, its very hor somtimes",3
Stayed at marina bay sands for 2 nights.  Room was nice and large and clean Obviously the great thing was the roof top pool it was fantastic.  Breakfast was ok A variety of foods obviously mostly asian based,4
"Spent the Easter long weekend at the hotel. It was definitely worth the wait. Such a luxurious hotel with a lot of restaurants, shops and attractions close by. It is also a good hotel to do some travelling around Singapore via the MRT.   Access to the infinity pools was amazing experience. Service of the hotel was superb, in particularly getting directions and also accessing the showers in the gym after we check out as our flight was later that evening. ",5
"The Hotel is very expensive and is charging so much more than other Hotels due to one of key attraction that is the infinity pool. Unfortunately the infinity pool is so overcrowded during the day that you cannot even find place to seat ( which for a 5 star hotel is quite amazing as a lack of service ) . The infinity pool becomes nice around 6PM where most of the guests leave the pool . Add to that the service is not really 5 star neither: the check-in was done with no greeting or smiling at all , then arrived in the room the safe was not working and the shower clench fell apart . Called the service to ask for the safe and it was a painful exercise as I had to provide my data ( and this to CLOSE the safe not to OPEN it , so no way I was stealing something ) like birthdate ad…",3
"Just came back from staying here and missing it already!  It took my breathe away when I walked out on Level 57th and it took a while to sink in the amazing view.  I stayed in the Suite room on level 53 and view of Garden by The Bay. I stayed in my room to watch the lights show, it on at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. You can hear the music when you stepped outside on the balcony.  Check-in is either at Tower 1 or Tower 3, I recommend Tower 1 as they have more counters and it's faster. My luggage was delivered to my room within 15mins of checked in.  I had dinner downstairs at one of the restaurant and buffet breakfast on Level 57 next to the Infinity pool.  The Casino is at the bottom of the hotel and you need to show your passport to gain entry.  The shopping centre was so nice as they…",5
"The hotel is nice, the rooms are not 5 star but the service is excellent and the pool is about 7 star so i have averaged the review at 5 star.  The views are amazing.  The pool doesn't run the length of the roof and is separated into two sections, one for adults and one for families which was really appreciated on an adults only trip.   It is a bit annoying to have to remember your room card to get to and from the pool and restaurant area - it means that you can't leave devices charging in your room if you are going up to the pool.    They are super strict about having a room card to get into the pool and once you are there you will see and appreciate why.   As long as you remember your card - it's all very smooth.   Overall a great stay   and a shout out to Spago by Wolfgang…",5
"In summary- the hotel is severely lacking in service, is poorly laid out, overpriced and too busy.  My husband and I splashed out on our honeymoon- paying for a room upgrade whist booking. We also advised them we were coming on our honeymoon, hoping they would acknowledge this and give us a special treat.   We had to line up for 15 minutes to check in (from other reviews I understand this is pretty good!). We advised the staff member checking us in that we were here for our honeymoon and he said he'd have to check if he could do anything for us.   After finally getting to our room in Tower 3 and queuing for a lift - as this was the lift lobby used for the infinity pool, we decided to go for a swim and check out the pool. We followed the masses all heading for the pool and went…",2
"We took the recommendations from other TripAdvisor readers that said if you can stay at the Marina and it's your first time in Singapore, you must stay at the Marina. Well, they were right and it was amazing. The pool, it's an experience all to itself, from morning to 11pm at night. The views at just fabulous.  The hotel staff is very helpful and they offered us a beautiful room with floor to ceiling windows. It's great to see Singapore at night and even the Bay Gardens next to the hotel. At night, it shines. So, yes, we will stay there again because we just have to. The experience is worth a second try.",5
The views from this hotel are amazing.  If your limited on time in Singapore I would definitely recommend staying here. It has everything you could need or want on the doorstep.  We only had 30 hours but the location and facilities enabled us to make excellent use of our time.  Late check out is expensive at half a days rate. This is based on the last minute days rate which is always more expensive than your booked rate and only extends till 6pm.  A very nice 5 star hotel and I would definitely stay again.,5
"Stayed in a club suite over the weekend on a business trip.  You simply can't beat this location - has access to so many great parts of the city within walking distance.  The infinity pool is a one-of-a-kind experience with most people (including me) taking a selfie with the backdrop of the city in the background.  I also saw someone drop their phone in the pool doing so!  It is a busy hotel because it's popular.  The pool area and observation deck were fantastic but it can get a little windy up there.  I enjoyed the Club 55 breakfast and tea as well since they were included in the club suite.  The shops were amazing - great designer stores and excellent restaurants.  I did not spend much time in the room, so next time I wouldn't get a suite.  The hotel is pricey, but for the…",4
"The views from the swimming pool are amazing. It was not crowded, so it was a surprise for me because the hotel is quite big. The service is really good. Our bedroom (Deluxe) was very big and with wonderful views of the skyline. It was a great experience that I recommend.",5
Went to the tower to view amazing Singapore at night..so nice. spectacular...could not say much as I am so impressed with the scenery..would have love to have a drink but the rest was full,5
"I stayed at the hotel just so that I can swim, relax and enjoy the view of Singapore from the rooftop swimming pool.  The view is spectacular like no other!  Also, the service is great!  The rooms are wonderful with a balcony that overlooks the south side of the island city.  It is pricey to stay at the MBS but for the experience, it is worth it.  The picture that promotes the hotel pretty much says it all.",5
"From check in to check out the staff went above and beyond, even surprised us with an anniversary cake and room decoration. Stayed in the grand club suite city view room, just beautiful. The sky deck was incredible, definitely a must see. Only a few cons, we weren't waited on in the sky gate for drinks and on check out weren't allowed access to the pool while we waited for our flight. ",4
"Stayed in MBS for a work conference and as with every year, they never fail to give me a room with an amazing view. I like staying at Tower 1 because the rooms are bigger and has a tub, but for this stay, I got a room at Tower 3  What I liked: - Its connected to the mall with very high end shops like Chanel but also has mid ranged shops like Sephora, Bath and Body, Din Tai Fung. If youre on a budget, just eat at the food court as it has a wide array of choices. - If you like to gamble, theres also a casino connected to the hotel. - Getting a cab either in the tower 1 or tower 3 lobbies are easy. The hotel is also connected to an MTR station. - I love the rooms with a balcony as it faces the Gardens by the Bay - Its connected to the convention center  What I didn't like: - I…",5
"I stayed here on honeymoon after being in Hong Kong at the Shangri-La and we were made to feel very special there. What an impersonal hotel MBS is. You have to queue on a rope system to check in. No acknowledgement we were on honeymoon from reception or anywhere else.  The room was ok but a lot of the towels were threadbare and actually ripped when being used. No turn down service at night.  The hotel lobby is like a train station full of tourists and not at all welcoming and the lift system is ridiculous if you want to go from your room to the pool. The lifts we went in were also never cleaned properly being dirty in the corners.  Ah, the pool. Yes it looks amazing but beyond that it's like spending a day lounging by the side of a municipal pool. There are no changing rooms. If…",2
"This landmark hotel has one of the largest number of rooms in any hotel in the world. The hotel certainly has that feeling of being very large! We had a room overlooking the city and river and it was spectacular! The infinity pool on the 57th floor is an experience in itself and a great place to relax any time of the day or watching the sunset. The hotel has a large range of restaurants of very high standard with high prices to match! There is a lot to do in the complex and it is only a short walk to the Gardens by the Bay. However it is quite a distance to the main city which is around a 30 minute walk or accessible by MRT, taxi or hop on hop off bus. It is one of the most expensive hotels to stay in Singapore and restaurant prices are very high although you get some discounts…",5
Considering the size of this hotel I was impressed how well everything works. The grand club room with city view in T3 was very spacious and had beautiful view of Singapore skyline. The infinity pool is not to be missed. Very good breakfast and lovely tea and canapes at Club 55.  Staying there is definitely a unique experience. ,5
I visited MarinaBaySands in last Christmas.  It was an expectacular experience. Scenery was incredibly beautiful from one side Singapore river and other side was ocean bay. Didn't explore much of the hotel's bars and restaurants because my visit was short but I had a breief time in Sky bar and some of the restaurants. Food was delicious and delicately prepared.  Anyway it is a must stay hotel in Singapore either if you on a short business trip or a leisure travel.  ,5
"To all of those who complain about this hotel all I can say is you must live in a wonderful world  where everything is absolutely perfect. I found this hotel to be one of the best I have ever stayed at. It is my view that the quality of the hotel shows through from the moment I checked in at 6am to the time I checked out two days later, I was on the 37th floor and had the benefit of access to the club lounge and dining area. All in all I would return to this Hotel without any hesitation and I do recommend it to you as a wonderful experience and treat.",5
"I have good and bad check in, depending on the receptionist and time of check in. Most of the time, the reception is very good, but what is frustrating is when you ask for a room type (e.g. premier room, or high floor), you will be turned down, or you will be told the rooms are full. If you check in early, you are then asked to check in at 2 or 3 p.m.  The best solution is: - ask for the room you want, go for a tour of the shopping in Marina Bay Sands or any of the mall in Singapore, then you can get the room you want -if you insist to check in there and then, you might not get a high room, city view (which you need to pay extra), or you pay for upgrade.  The club room with club facilities is the best deal...you can use the club room on > 57 floor and have breakfast, lunch and…",4
"Hi, It was awesome stay...room was perfect with awesome view of 'Garden by the bay' but as said there has to be bad apple and it was 'Jin Shan' resturant. Beer was served after food was served and that too after reminder, order pekkiing duck which was missing, requested to speak to resturant manager...manger arived after 3 reminder, had to cancel pekking duck for it was quit late and received bill including it...max resturant could do was cancell the whole bill...but still not expected this type of service from such high class place",4
"MBS has great restaurants like Spago and Sky at 57 yet their who design causes alot of inconvenience to it's guests. For one, the check in lobby is ugly and cold. Feels like an airport. Their top 2 restaurant Spago and Sky at 57 are only accessible through the same lifts carrying guests going and leaving the pool sometimes dripping wet in slippers and leaving pools of water in lift. Guests going to Spago n Sky at 57 dress up elegantly or at least smart casual to be mixed with guests in bath towels n slippers in same lift and walkway. This is a design flaw and the management of MBS need to change this. This can be easily fixed with just 1 lift access to those 2 restaurants and placing a segregator ( with planters or something) so the elegantly dressed guests and dripping wet…",2
"We were so excited to be staying at this hotel. However on arrival staff impersonal and although had our booking had not allocate a room. Hence we were not given what we paid for. After two hours of discussion we were moved to a room that could accommodate 3 adults as my mother was traveling with us. Be careful with booking as it was made clear we need twin double beds months prior. Great location, beautiful pool but was it value for money? Other traveling received better service at other hotels close by.",4
We had a room on the 43rd floor with the most wonderful view over to Gardens by the Bay.  Lovely room beautifully presented.  Pool was sooooo wonderful mainly because of its location on the 57th floor.  Service from the staff was exceptional .  Two disappointments no chairs or Lounges for resting in the complex particularly in the shopping levels and no facilities for visitors who have to check out in the morning but flight isn't until late at night.  Would have appreciated an area for shower and resting prior to our flight.  Overall a very lovely stay however,5
"The hotel was immaculate in cleanliness and presentation, upon arrival was greeted with a warm and inviting attitude.  The room was very spacious with all the amenities you could possibly want or need. The location of the hotel is second to none, a lot to see but the ones that stand out are the infinity pool which you must experience during your stay, gardens by the bay is also a highlight and visiting both in the day and night yielded a different experience. A special thank you to one particular staff member Joanne Gonzales who went above and beyond her duty on more then one occasion. Overall and amazing experience and would recommend to friends and family. ",4
"Great service, we vad some luck and get to check in early otherwise marina bay has quite bad check in IF you are there for a short visit and want to Explorer the infinity pool and slupark you need at least two nights.   Our stay where perfect, marina bay sand actuelly gives you that extra thing. Our room where placed at level 40 in tower 3. The interior are really nice and when you put the hotelcard in the room the curtains automatic open, and IT didnt get worse when it showed a 40level panorama view of the ocean.   We ate at several of the restaurants at the hotel a all of them held a high standard.   Couldent be more satisfied",5
What really makes this hotel special (apart from its design) is the staff and the pool. Although busy you may find yourself spending majority of the time at the pool. It has an amazing view of the skyline of Singapore and is open 6am-11pm. The staff are some of the most exceptional I have dealt with. Must visit here at least once.,5
"5 star hotel ,but service was not as good as expected .  requested high floor but when we checked in, there was no high floor room avb.  Too many tourists crowed at lobby waiting for c/I. sky swimming pool was a MUST GO place, you won't regret.",4
"We have spent 3 nights in the hotel and, after all, have to admit that basically there is nothing to complain.  But on a second glance we believe the prices are a little bit too high compared to what you can get elsewhere (from our travel experience we have see  quite a few ones).  There is of course a fair basis to discuss but we believe this is not 100% value for money.  We felt more like being ""one among a lot"" just to describe the feeling.  But it's true that the surrounding and the amenities are top. Rooftop pool is just awesome, so is the gym.  Rooms, we had a standard room with king bed, are nice and spacious with all you need.  We would recommend the hotel to everyone just to explore it, as we did.  But next time we will probably book in the other one we have been before.",4
"If you have the opportunity to stay at this Beautiful Hotel only just for 1 night you won't regret it. The Hotel spoilt me for my Anniversary and I do appreciate the kind gesture. Friendly staff,  amenities and rooms are stunning. The views from the Room of Gardens by the Bay with it's night light display is simply magical.  When you enter the 57 floor with your room key gives you access to the largest infinity pool of 150m in the world. The Spago restaurant is a vibrant spot to chill have a coffee and enjoy good music. The Ce' La Vi Club is exclusive to guests and one can dance the night away with views to die for. Downstairs in the lobby we enjoyed a delicious croissant and cake from the Sweet Spot with a traditional Thai iced tea and cappuccino. ",5
"We stayed here at the end of a holiday through Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) and Singapore, for one night. We were in ahigh floor with Club access. Checkin was a queue nd a little impersonal. The room was huge and everything you would expect from this level of hotel. You have to arrive early for the Club hours (afternoon tea and evening) if you want to avoid a queue, although we were offered a drink while we waited.The staff were very efficient and courteous. Be aware that you will also need to queue for breakfast if you like to eat later. A wonderful experience but a little impersonal for me.",4
"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was unfortunately rather disappointing, the Skypark was a delightful experience but I am shocked to discover that if we hadn't have been staying for two nights we would have not been able to gain access past check out time. Whilst staff were polite in the Skypark, after enduring about ordering a poolside lunch we were forgotten about for about 25 minutes before I chased to replace the order and then given another persons order before receiving our own.   For almost £500 breakfast wasn't included, there was a lot to choose from but the experience itself lacked personalisation. The breakfast staff were polite, but I did receive a very unclear instruction on where the nearest toilet was during breakfast leading me to believe it was outside of the hotel.…",2
What a hotel.I am short of words to describe the beauty of this hotel.It was like a dream come true. Magnificent views of Singapore’s glittering city district and  picture-perfect Gardens by the Bay.Swimming in the world’s highest and longest infinity pool with its unrivalled panoramic views – a once-in-a-lifetime experience.Beautiful rooms. Diligent staff and excellent room service.,5
"What a fabulous hotel... we arrived mid-morning and they were able to have our room ready by 11 a.m.  The staff are very courteous and the service, excellent.  The hotel itself is an architectural wonder, the shopping is unbelievable, and the rooftop infinity pool is breathtaking... and don't forget the food!!  There are multiple celebrity restaurants in the hotel and the shopping concourse, and your choices are endless.... Would go back to MBS in a heartbeat!",5
"We arrived there at the reception and when they saw that my girlfriend will celebrate her birthday the next day, we were upgrade from the 12th --> 46th Floor (Special thanks to Jeraldine at the front desk!!). The room was wonderful with a small terrace viewing over the skygardens and the sea. The pool is absolutely breathtaking and fortunately it is only accessible for hotel guests. For birthday we had a birthday cake waiting in our room including candles :) The service and hospitality is just amazing at this please and i cant wait to come back again!",5
"We stayed overnight on a stopover through Singapore, we had a suite which was beautiful. The room was large and well furnished with a sitting room with stunning views out over the Ocean and the ""flowers"" at the botanical gardens.  The bed also had the same wonderful view and the bonus of windows that opened to let the breeze in.  The bathroom and amenities were excellent as well. The only let down is the Club 55 lounge, it wasn't furnished nicely and we ended up skipping the evening drinks and canapés there in favour of Ce La Vie as that was outdoors and had a better atmosphere. We enjoyed the afternoon tea in the club lounge (included) but went downstairs to Adrift for breakfast (again included)  The swimming pool area was packed but that is expected when you have 100%…",4
"Marina Bay Sands is an expensive place. But, I truly enjoyed the room and the amenities available. MBS is like a mall (most hotels in SG are) and provides complete entertainment. It is a must visit. Also, while you are there, don't miss the light show in the evening and the supertree grove.",5
The architecture of MBS is so unique.  There are no other buildings in the world like it.  My lovely BF got us a suite for my bday.  The suite was enormous - my favorite part was the bathtub and the stunning view of the Singapore skyline.  There is a special club for those in the suites with a 'tea time' which was actually free flow champagne and lots of tasty snacks.  My favorite part of our stay was doing the sunrise yoga ($29 sgd) on the cantilever (nose) of the building.  The class was small and the yoga instructor was great.  It is probably one of the more incredible locations for a yoga class.  The pool can be crowded so I would recommend going early in the morning or late at night if you want to avoid lots of selfie snappers.,5
This Hotel has it all. Shopping..Casino...Restaurants.. etc Near by Gardens by the bay...A must see.  You can take taxi but Metro is amazing...take you to almost everywhere even at night...Singapore is one of the safest and Cleanest cities Ive ever visited LOVE IT,5
"Staying here was a great experience, however I wouldn't recommend staying more than a night or two. While it's beautiful and the pool was amazing, I feel as though you could definitely get better value for money on a longer trip. However, with that being said, it is definitely worth stat for 1 or 2 nights. The pool was amazing, it also wasn't busy when we went which was a bonus. And the view from our room was beautiful. Definitely a once in a life time opportunity for us ",4
"We chose this hotel for the the pool, which doesn't disappoint. The structural design of the rooftop and the infinity pool experience are definitely worth the visit. But I would only stay here for max 1 night! We are a family of four, checked in to the hospitality family suite. Which had just been remodelled and the room was very large and spacious with all modern cons. 2 bathroom, kitchenette, king bed, two single beds etc. The room was in tower 2 room 232 - the negatives it had a large balcony that we never used because it overlooked a noisy high way and was on top of restaurant kitchen exhaust fans. If you opened the door the room smelt like Nasi goreng which existed 24 hours. You also have to walk across the main foyer to access the pool lift, it takes about 10 min to get to…",3
"Although a little bit expensive, the hotel has everything you can ask - awesome staff, incredibly comfortable bed and awesome bedroom view! And of course, my favorite the rooftop infinite pool!!  Staying at Marina Bay Sands is a unique experience, everything in the Marina complex can be charged to your room, including the food you get at restaurants in the shopping mall across the street.  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, with giant windows with bay view automated curtain. The bathroom and shower are really good, you even get 2 sinks to share the bathroom with your partner.  Now the downside - not all fares include breakfast and there's a loooong line for check-in, which make early check-in/late check-out almost impossible to happen.  The pool is really amazing! You…",4
"I've spend one night at this hotel, check in was a bit slow but overall service is ok, if you are in Singapore it's worth a visit just to see the views from the infinity pool which were amazing, it's a huge hotel with thousand guests so it might be a bit overwhelming and it lacks of a personal touch you are just another guest but it's just my prospective so I wouldn't spend there more than 2 days but it was definitely a experience not to miss ",4
"WOW seeing the first time you will be speachless, we stayed at the hotel was the most amazing experience, everything above the expectation.  Will be back soon. Bear in Mind nothing is cheap in Singapore bring €£$¥",5
"The best views,good service and quality. We had an incredible room on the 52nd floor, unforgettable! good for all ages. Excellent surroundings near the hotel, bars and restaurants. Once in the hotel, you don't want to get out. ",5
"From check in to check out This hotel was great. It has 3 towers So make sure you know which tower you are reserved for because you need to check in at a specific place. The roof top pool offers a great view of the city. The water temperature was great. There is a mall attached which has some more affordable places to eat. Also has a casino , which we did not visit.",5
This hotel is not the best one I've been to but it's definitely one of a kind. The rooms are lovely and spacious and we were given an amazing cake for our anniversary. The rooftop pool is just incredible and it's worth staying at the hotel just so you can experience that.,5
"We stayed our first night in Singapore in a club view room. The view is wonderful along with the bed and linen. Black out curtains which are electronically controlled.   We were able to check in early which made a great difference for us as we had arrived off our international flight at 8am. While we waited for our room to be ready, we were able to use the pool with special access cards.  The pool food and drinks are quite expensive, especially the cocktails. We also tried to order room service one afternoon and our calls went unanswered. The club 55 is great, but extremely busy.  The buffet breakfast was on level 55, it was nice but not world class.   Overall this hotel is beautiful but too big to be able to give high quality service. We moved onto another Singapore hotel which…",4
"No USB outlet to charge your iPhone or mobile devices.   The room I stayed, Tower 1, Room  4468, the A/C fan was quite loud.   Other than that, the view was spectacular and room was clean. It reminded me of the Las Vegas rooms such as Venetian, the Bellagio",5
I really enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend the Marina Bay Sands to anyone looking for a great luxury experience. I enjoyed relaxing by the infinity pool with a glass of champagne while watching the magnificent sunsets painting colors across the horizon.,5
"We stayed for 7 nights in an Orchid Suite as part of a holiday to go to the rugby 7s. The hotel is an amazing building and resort and even though ours was a long stay we could have stayed for longer. The rooftop pool is fantastic and the view is amazing... truly unique. Having this makes it like a beach resort where you relax by a pool with a view... catch the sun and have food and drink all day and into the night. A city break can also be relaxing! For example, one day we spent relaxing by the pool and others we went out into the city etc but could still sit by the pool at night. Club55, as part of our room rate was great. Brillant views and open for complementary breakfast, drinks during the day, afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and canapes. Well worth a club room if…",5
Super and luxurious living Awesome hotel with so much high quality stuff  Awesome infinity pool Awesome outdoor view Awesome and Mind blowing structure with all types of latest gym equipments  Superb sky park,5
"We stayed here 17-20 April,and after seeing this hotel being built on a tv program,five years ago,we were looking forward to celebrate our wedding anniversary here.Easy check-in,and was given a balcony room on the 50th floor.the views from that balcony was jaw dropping.the room was beautifully decorated,lovely shower room,with enough drawer,and wardrobe space.comfy bed,clean fresh sheets,a chaise langue,and desk chair.complimentary water every day.did not use the mini bar.the skypark was great.spent a lot of time there,using the infinity pool,enjoying the observation deck,and all the bars and the service from the guys and gals who  served pool food and beverages.special thanks to Ryan who offered us some champagne,to Lucas from spago restaurant and bar,some anniversary ice…",5
"There is nowhere else quite like this hotel. I think the most remarkable thing is that despite the size, the sky garden, the infinity pool and all the other paraphernalia...it really is quite a good hotel. Service is fast, efficient, smiling staff who cannot do enough for you. The restaurants are really very good. Querk's and Spago excellent. The Spago bar is a wonderful place and the restaurant extremely fine.",5
"My wife and I stayed here for one night. I think that was enough to be able to use the infinity pool and get the views. Overall, the rooms were nothing special for the money. The whole check in process was extremely impersonal and was just a processing line. The only reason to stay here is to use the pool. Even this was busy and cold! It's not even in good location to explore the rest of Singapore. I would say it is overpriced and you could get a much nicer hotel for half the cost if you were staying longer in Singapore. ",3
"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most spectacular hotels that you can ever visit. If you are lucky enough to stay and enjoy the famous pool, you can witness one of Singapore's amazing sunsets from high above. ",5
"We stayed in the executive suite, which gave us access to the club on level 55. The view from there is fantastic and the offerings (breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks) during the day make up for the extra cost on the room. Executive rooms are obviously a popular option, as seating can get tight in the club. We had a city view room, which afforded great views of the city around the clock. The infinity pool can get crowded too, with everyone one wanting selfies and photos of the view from up there. There is an adult only area which helps. Has a railway station underneath, which affords easy access to other parts of the city in airconditioned comfort. The onsite Shoppes by the Bay is high end, but well worth some time.",4
We loved this property!  Every room has a spectacular view.  Well aligned for taking public transportation around the city and good proximity to the botanic gardens.   The room was spacious and well appointed.  The rooftop pool is a must do!,5
"Setting my foot into the MBS hotel gave me a luxury feeling. I enjoyed The Rise restaurant's impeccable service. With high hopes checking into the room (the room was awesome by the way).  Having a great day, we set out to visit the famous infinity pool. As we don't often come Singapore, it's our first time staying here. Heading to the pool, taking with us only a kid card and an adult card trying to enter 2 adults. The nightmare happened: I got utterly embarrassed for using the kid card to enter the pool. Thinking all 3 keycards are the same as we left 1 keycard in the room.  I wouldn't be so unhappy if I was carefully explained that I needed to use 2 cards. But I was not. I stood there while this old man at the gate berated me with degrading words like I'm supposed to know by…",1
We booked a grand club room with city view for two nights (with access to the nice club 55). The room is just perfect: The bath is lovely and the bathroom ist not a simple shower but a room for itself. Room service is friendly and excellent. Of course the infinty pool and the bar in top were extraordinary. This luxury has its price - but once in a lifetime! ,5
"I stayed here for 2 nights and loved every minute of it.  There is so much to do here, and not just for a particular target market.  I saw many families, couples, solo travelers, and even older couples here. It is a huge resort, that consists of 3 towers, with the infinity pool located on the 57th floor that offers the most amazing views of the Singapore skyline! There is a huge variety of places to eat, from fine dining to the food court. Also, the Makansutra food market is within walking distance too.",5
"Amazing place to stay, to stroll for the day and to seek peace within you. The place has its own scenery for you to love and a great place to stay and have some time to enjoy. Its a great place to bring your family,friends and even your partner in life.   Definitely a place for wanting more to stay.",5
"I first came to marina bay sand. Great casino experience. Casino is diverse. The staff here is friendly, the drinks here are also good. This is a classy and luxurious place.I have a great moment here with my friends. I will come back here in the next time . That's very wonderful !!!",5

Just Awesome ....everything is just luxurious. The swimmingpool is just Woww. The staff is always kind and helpful for everything. Nice view from the Top. Highly recommend. To stay there is very expensive.,5
"This hotel is the epitome of luxury - from the exterior, the rooms, infinity pool and shoppes for convenience. Plus there is plenty of activities and entertainment in close proximity.  However, unless you have club rooms or suites booked with a dedicated check-in area, you'll have to queue up for quite some time just to get yourself in as it has one of the highest of guest turnovers and busiest hotel lobbies.",5
"Buy 2 for $10! While stocks last! says the coca cola ad on the mini bar. There are generally a lot of ads around, on basically every screen. For one night, we got ourselves a room with fantastic view and entrance to the amazing infinity pool, it was worth it. On the other hand, there are much better offers in singapore for half the money, without the pool then. ",3
"Amazing location, very clean rooms, perfect service, super view from the room on the 38th floor ,everywhere: in the hotel, in the city super organisation ! Staff is very friendly and helpful. We will come again !",5
One of the biggest hotels in the world. Over 2000 rooms in 3 tower and lots of restaurants and shops. Bar on 57 must for stunning views of Singapore. Drinks surprisingly not expensive. Use tower 1 elevator.  lively coffe shop on the ground floor with brilliant cakes.,5
"We chose to spend one night (and many hundreds of dollars) at this hotel purely to experience the infinity pool and enjoy the view from the room. The pool is truly amazing, well worth the money to be on top of the ""ship"". The views are brilliant but the whole hotel smacks of a money making exercise. Remove items from your mini bar fridge and it automatically adds the item to your account even if you return it later. Never had that happen before so beware of that! The room itself is nice but nothing special to justify the huge amount of money we spent. Choose fast internet, over normal speed and there goes another $20, so beware!! Even the movies cost around $20 to watch on the tv, you would think they could at least offer a few free ones but no, they want even more money. Found…",4
"No matter what room option you go for, Marina Bay Sands is expensive. There's no getting around it. But, as with most once-in-a-lifetime experiences, you shouldn't let that deter you. If you're visiting Singapore and you can make it happen, you should stay here - I think a 2 or 3 night stay is ideal (you wouldn't need anymore than three nights to make the most of it).  Against that background, we stayed in a Club City View room - which came with access to the Club55 Lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea, pre-dinner drinks and canapés. In terms of assessing the difference in cost between a Premier Room and a Club Level room - we easily made up that value in terms of the food and drink we were offered in the Lounge. In fact, we treated the afternoon tea as lunch and the canapés as…",5
"I stayed at this hotel near the end of March. In the beginning I was a bit sceptical as I read some negative reviews. When I arrived there I was a bit overwelmed from the sere size of the building. My check in was fast and efficient, it did not take more than 10 minutes. I had a corner room on the 35th floor, with great view of the gardens. My room was spotless clean and everything was replaced everyday! The staff was really helpful and polite. The first day I had dinner at the Rise restaurant, the food was really good and the selection excellent. Big shout to the guys at the Spargo bar at the roof top by the pool! This hotel has something for everybody. I wish I had some more time. I would definitely recommended and I can't wait to visit Singapore again!",5
"Armed with pre purchased drink vouchers to go up to either of the bar areas available to non guests of the hotel you are afforded one of the most amazing views of greater Singapore. During the day try and get there right on opening to get one of the couch areas looking toward the harbour and Sentosa. At night the ""bow"" of this amazing building would be better to look ""down"" at the Singapore Flier and see the East side of the island. Well worth the most expensive beer in Singapore. ",4
"Stayed here with my girlfriend while we were visiting Singapore mainly so we could go to the infinity pool on the roof!  We arrived mid morning before the designated check in time but the reception staff were very accommodating and gave us our room early.  Our room was on the 46th floor with a great view over Marina Bay Gardens. The room was large and spacious, very clean and tidy. Nice bathroom as well.  The infinity pool was pretty cool so was the bar on the top floor for drinks at night. The hotel and surrounding shops/amenities were all excellent.  Overall I would highly recommend.",5
"The Marina Bay Sands hotel is a must stay to use the pool on the 57th floor. You look down on the whole city from the pool with a great view either day or night. The hotel has a number of fine restaurants, plus it is connected to a top line mall that has a casino, top shops, movie house, many restaurants. The laser show was not working this time, but they have added a big park behinds the hotel and there are enough activities that you do not need to leave the property.",5
"I don't think it's any secret why everyone looks to stay at the MBS: the pool. And it truly is an amazing sight to be lounging across from the Singapore skyline day or night in a pool 57 floors up. I've never stayed an any hotel like this. However, the hotel itself falls a little short of the premium you pay. The rooms are very dated, and honestly not well maintained. It's not that they were dirty, just a little run down. This is also surprising considering the hotel is not even that old. This was our first trip to Singapore, and I'm glad we stayed at the MBS because taking advantage of that pool was totally worth it, and having close proximity to the shops and Science and Art museum was nice. However, now having experienced the pool, I would look elsewhere for my next visit as…",4
"This hotel as amazing views from the pool on the top floor. The hotel staff are excellent at check-in. The hotel rooms are unreal. Amazing. Huge shower, huge bath, huge bed. Everything is perfect. There's one downfall but it's what you expect. It's expensive to eat and drink. ",5
"The hotel looks so impressive from the outside, it really is the highlight of the surrounding sky line! At night it looks great and gives a lot of good photo opportunities!  The hotel has an amazing sky park on the top which is accessible only to hotel guests (there is an observation deck up there which the public can buy tickets to, but the pool is off limit). The pool has great views (although it is freezing!!) and staff are great at walking around and taking orders once you express an interest. On our last night, we went to Flight Bar at the top for tapas and drinks - the views were incredible!!!!! Service a little slow, but that was fine for us as we wanted to stay for the night.   The hotel is also great placed for other restaurants (the mall is attached to the hotel), and…",4
"This is my second time stay in Marina bay sands. First visit was two years ago. Compare to first visit , second visit was not nice at all. The infinity swimming pool was super crowded. All the jacuzzies are full with ppls. Towels in the swimming pool were stained. Not recommended for long staying. No gym assess and have to pay extra charges for small simple things. ",3
"This hotel is insane! The shear size of the hotel itself is mind blowing and it did not disappoint. We stayed in a Premier Skyview room with an extra bed. First off, the staff at checkin were very helpful as we asked for a slightly earlier checkin to attend a function. They offered us a room that was ready but it was 20 floors lower than our original so we didn't take it. However our room was ready 1:30pm (normally checkin at 3pm) so this was very kind. The staff brought the bags to the room as soon as we got in there.  The room was huge! Way bigger than the pictures online showed it to be! Even with an extra bed, is was easy to move around with all our luggage on the floor. The views were unreal day and night! Bathroom was massive and the bath was big enough to lie comfortably…",5
"Made a bee line for the hotel with a mission to head to the roof to check out the view and to say ""been there!"".  The external structure architecturally is amazing and the closer you get to the building - the more you marvel at the design.  Stood underneath, walked around and through to the gardens, went into the lobby which was very unassuming and somewhat disappointing compared to the external view.  So! Roof top did I full fill my mission............. NO! Not at 23$ per person for the privilege.  Shocking.  I wouldn't mind paying for a drink at the top but 23$ each - Singapore $'s just for a view I got from other buildings and the flight into Singapore Changi airport - no way.  ",4
We stayed in this hotel last May 2016 with our kids. We booked for a deluxed room and got a free room updgrade! Our kids were very happy with our spacious room at Tower 1.  We can see the gardens by the bay in our room terrace especially its nice light during the night.  The receptionist at the check in counter is very accomodating. During check out we were entertained inside the Sands Lounge. The sky park is a must visit place and their infinity pool is a picture perfect at night with the citylight as a background. Our stay is very mememorablle! We will definitely return but we need to connsider the budget for the accomodation since its a bit pricey BUT worth a try! :-),5
"An amazing experience. I thought it would be all about the pool, the views, etc. But this is an extremely well-run hotel with staff that seem to care about what they do. So much choice for meals and breakfast means that it caters for all tastes, budgets and fussiness of kids. For example, Sweet Spot on the lobby floor is a must for coffee, cakes and some great sandwiches and pastries. Close to things to with easy access to MRT via the shopping mall. Really looking forward to going back to this wonderful hotel.",5
"Yes, this hotel is pricey. But I feel it's totally worth it. Stayed there for two nights in a deluxe room with the nice view of the ocean and the Gardens by the Bay. The room was very nice with complete amenities. Enjoyed the sky pool tremendously!!! Also enjoyed the casino mall and the food court. There are many choices of food there at reasonable prices. The MRT is right underneath. Very convenient to go to other parts of the city and to the airport. As s runner, it's a perfect location for me as I can do my rubbings in the Gardens by the Bay and around the Promenade. ",5
Definitely visit. The views are amazing. You have to pay $20 each to go to the bar but this can be exchanged for a drink. For 2 cocktails you will have to pay on top again but it's well worth it.  The hotel is amazing and the staff are great.,5
I don't think many international travellers of the world would not recognise the architecture of this iconic hotel. The unusual design of 3 interlinked towers instead of a single building creates a vast and very long cavernous lobby area.  When we arrived by taxi to tower 3 our bags were immediately whisked away and stored for us until check in time. You need to know what tower your room is in to ascertain where to check in but it is not difficult.  Yes the hotel is busy but check in was very efficient and Ruby was very friendly. We had booked via the hotels web site and received a very good rate for a deluxe room on the 47th floor with sea views and overlooking the Marina gardens. The room was extremely spacious with all the amenities you could want but no branded toiletries in…,4
We was there with my wife the second week of April... and it was great... it was an unforgettable experience... One week before they ask us for our documents to compleat our check-in and do it faster...  at first we booked a deluxe room but when we arrived we ask for a bigger room with breakfast so they give us the club room... We will never forget the first emotions when we enter in that room... it was really great...  also the stuff was very nice and polite...  On day we will return to relives that experience...  thank you for everything marina bay,5
"We stayed here for one night as a stop-over. We'd visited Singapore before and just wanted to experience the hotel and the legendary infinity pool on the roof. Whilst the rooms are very nice and typical of any 5 star hotel in this part of the world we weren't really wowed by the place. I got a special deal but still paid over £200 for the night, which  when compared to other accommodation in the city is overpriced. The pool is stunning and view from the top is definitely a one off (access to this is what you're really paying for) but it was too over-run with posers and selfie sticks for our liking and we felt it lacked a bit of class.",3
The hotel is huge and when I say huge I mean huge. It's difficult to fathom just how large it really is. So you can feel a little drowned out sometimes by how hectic everything is and how many people are around you at times. But the view from the roof top pool and the quality rooms makes up for it.,5
