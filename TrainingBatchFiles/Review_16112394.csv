Incredible views and surrounding amenities. Worth staying for one day just to check out the infinity pool as it cannot be accessed without booking a room! A must do for anyone visiting Singapore!!!!!! ,5,
"We stayed here for 3 days in April 2017. We had a room on the 40th floor overlooking the Gardens. Pic below,,   Room was brilliant, and large with all what you would expect from this hotel such as balcony, air con, beautiful bathroom with large walk in shower, t.v. , tea making facilities, hair dryer, iron and board, safe and free water each day. The fridge you have to pay for, 10 S dollars for your stay.  The infinity swimming pool and  Jacuzzi is all and more, plenty of beds which, if not being used the staff will remove the towels unless you have left a bag there. Drinks are expensive and add 17.5% on top of what is on the menu,, A short walk to all the main shops where you can eat in lots of restaurants.. We ate in what is very much like Food Republic, get a table and walk…",4,
"What a truly magnificent piece of imagination and engineering to build such a structure. Our suite was spacious and well equipped; clinical in its cleanliness one could say. The view of the city from our 40th floor room was extraordinary, especially at night. You cannot appreciate the shear size of this Hotel and its accompanying support shops unless you walk around in it. And the roof-top pool.......on the 57th floor....absolutely sensational! We spent the Easter weekend at Marina Bay, and it sure cost a lot....but I'd do it again in a heart-beat! Oh, and Club 55 is really good value as it includes breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés. The staff are so caring and nothing is too much trouble. We loved it!",5,
"Wow! I came here for my other half birthday and we were spoilt rotten by the staff at Marina Bay Sands. We first came into the check in desk greeted by Glenn who gave us a room in level 40 and late check out. He was so personable, bubbly and so considerate. When we went up to the infinity pool, breath taking views but what more impressed us was the pool staff went gave us a hand signed birthday card signed and gave us complementary fruit platter. Later on in the evening, we received a chocolate birthday cake in our room with a candle. Thank you so much staff at Marina Bay Sands. Yes it was a nice room and nice view but what made this experience memorable was that we felt special and you treated us so well. Highly recommended. Best hotel in the WORLD!!! NO THE UNIVERSE!!!",5,
"I booked a trip to Thailand for my husbands 30th and as an additional surprise booked a 2 night stay at MBS.   We flew from Phuket which only took at hour and a half and then was an additional 20 minutes to the hotel.   We arrived at around lunchtime so it was relatively busy with check-in but we were seen to quickly and it was hassle free.   The building is beautiful and the lobby is gorgeous, with plenty of open space and fresh flowers.   Despite being early for check-in our room was ready immediately which was an added bonus as we were only there for 3 days so wanted to get straight out to explore the city.   Our room was 4917 on the 49th floor and we loved it! On entering we put the key in the wall and the curtains opened automatically to reveal the most beautiful view of…",5,
"The hotel is too big and has very little charm. Check in and out is a very tiresome process. If you stay at the executive floor, you have access to the lounge 55. The service there is very good as is the food and drinks. Room cleaning is very good. Hotel is expensive relative to other hotels in the area.",3,
"Let me start with something. The minute the taxi drops you (at the main entrance at Tower 1), you will feel like ""Oh my god what did I get myself into"". That was how I felt when we first arrived and witnessed the hoards of people standing outside. I told my wife that from the looks of it, we may need to reconsider having breakfast here with the insane amount of people.   I was never so wrong in my life.   For our entire duration, every single detail in our stay was taken care of with so much attention, it felt as if we had our own personal butler. The service on the legendary infinity pool, the 4 breakfast options that we had available for us where we didn't wait a single minute to be seated, the fast check-in/check-out, the room that was a prime condition (everything worked and…",5,
"We paid a lot for this stay n faced the following issue :  1. The bathroom smells horrible. As soon as you step in you can smell foul odour ( smell like wee actually :( ) from the sewage and drain. I wrote a note to the staff when we check out but didn't hear anything back. All they care about is that they take money from you and would not do anything to compensate the bad experience.  2. Our key card is not working. We went all the way up to Level 57 n the card is not working. One of the staff show us her rude face n tell us to sort it out ourselves by going down to the concierge as she cannot help. She could have called up the concierge n double check our details n do more to ""help"". But she didn't. Mind you. That day was heavy raining pouring n imagine how frustrated we are!!…",1,
"I stayed here with a friend of mine for one night in November 2016. I had always wanted to stay at this hotel and I was not disappointed. We had a room on the 34th floor with a city view.  The check in was quick and efficiant. The room was clean and big with a fantastic view. We used the infinity pool which again was a dream of mine, it was cloudy and even rained a little but we didn't care. We used room service which was quick and excellent. I will definitely stay here again if I visit Singapore a second time. I <3 SG",5,
The Marina Bay Sands hotel was on my bucket-list from the moment I saw it. It is a must for visiting Singapore. The hotel was excellent in every aspect! The check-in and check-out process is very simple especially for such a high-class hotel. The rooms are very clean with nice views of the city or port. The hotel offers many choices for dining and also for shopping. The best part of the entire hotel is for sure the pool. The pool is an infinity pool at the top of the hotel offering views of the entire city below. You can relax at the pool while enjoying a drink or food served by very friendly hotel staff. The night offers even better views of the city below and the hotel provides warm robes for when it gets a bit cooler at night. Overall the experience at this hotel is…,5,
"If you would like to stay in luxury hotel, Marina Bay Sands should be your list. They have casino provide, food court on the ground flool, can visit Sky Park at the top of the hotel. And closed to MTR, can easy walk to Garden by the bay.",4,
"Honestly I had a big expectation about the hotel.   For the check in a long queue wait for you and if you are the visitor no sofás can be found in the área.  Due to the hugh numbers of guest is very difficult get the bellboy to guidence to you to the room.  The best in the room are the toilet that has a very commodious and the view. However nothing especial.  The best and that it makes the hotel unique is the swimming pool,  the sunrise and the sunsent are experience you don't miss.  The breaksfast was good specially the Staff. Still remember one guy called Regalado who make very gratefull the time de spend there during the morning.  ",3,
"check-in: it was crowded and confusing when we checked in at the hotel. the online reservation did not mention which tower to check in our rooms. despite we waited in queue for almost 30 minutes, we were accommodated by the manager to speed up the waiting time... and upgraded our room from deluxe twin view to grand club room!  staff: courteous and friendly. from check-in, in-room dining to bellman/porter services.  room: the suite is amazing views of the marina and gardens by the bay. spacious and clean room and luxurious bath amenities.  other: nice 24-hour high-speed complimentary wifi access. although crowded even at night, the view from the ""selfienity"" pool was such an experience.  wonderful breakfast at club55.  overall: very satisfied. yes, it is expensive but a splurge…",5,
"Stayed at orchid suite on the 53rd floor.  Room is big and spacious with spectacular view of the city.   Very nice bathroom with good amenities. Mini bar is locked unless you request for them.  Friendly staff, however no halal food around. ",4,
"must book this hotel at earily one month in advanced .. crazy damm busy hotel .. the room was very well managed & service was impeccable  they have moslly all celebrity Restaurant  including chef goden Ramasay   daniel ,,oizza   punjab Grill ,,,,,,cut .....spigo  love this amazing place",5,
we stayed for 3nt with my family in march 2017. We upgraded to premium rooms and were allowed room on 33rd floor with stunning views of garden by the bay from balcony. room was very spacious and with all luxury amenities. but what's make this hotel special is the Infiniti pool on 57th floor with amazing views of singapore also hot water jaccuzi's with views of garden by the bay was relaxing.  but it is slightly more costly then it should be. casino is just adjacent but it takes 10-15 min to get thru checking of passports. waiting line to sit in for breakfast also puts you off.,5,
"There are common threads to all reviews of Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and they're true; great views, great service, very busy, popular and very pricey. If you really want to experience Singapore however, then MBS has got to be one of the places that you have to go. There's no need for me to go into detail about the hotel, because its been reviewed many a time before. My experience of the hotel is that it is a remarkable architectual and engineering structure that really shapes the skyline and culture of Singapore.  I did not experience anything negative during my stay and everything was as it should have been for a 5-star, world class hotel. Service was great, amenities were great and there's definitely grand feel to the hotel.  The only thing I would say is that the hotel is a…",5,
"I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands around 3-4 times before primarily because I was attending conferences at the convention center across the street.  Most of my Singaporean friends have said that they would not recommend it to visitors because of the crowds.  I would tend to agree.  The hotel is very nice - spacious rooms, good restaurants and the convenience of being across the street from more wonderful restaurants and shops.  However, it is not the place to go if you want to relax.  Even at the start of the day, there is a throng waiting for tables at breakfast (a 'saner' alternative would be to take breakfast at the 57th floor).  This would give you a wonderful view of the pool which MBS is renowned for, but be forewarned that it is already teeming with people at 7am.  [On…",4,
"I spent one night at this hotel following a cruise. This is the most incredible hotel that I have ever seen. My room was in Tower 1 on the 41st floor and provided excellent views of the bay. I arrived at the hotel very early following my cruise (approximately 9:00 in the morning) and was surprised that they already had a room ready for me. I was able to check-in very early without an extra charge. My room was very spacious, clean and well-furnished.   I visited the SkyPark and saw the incredible swimming pool. Unfortunately, I did not have time to swim. I also visited the nearby Gardens by the Bay - absolutely stunning! After touring both domes at Gardens by the Bay, I explored the hotel's extremely impressive shopping mall and had dinner at a nice pizza restaurant in the mall.…",5,
"Staying at this hotel had long been on my bucket list, mainly for the Infinity Pool.  Though check-in was from 3pm, we had to check out of another place at 11am and headed here and were happy to find we could check in.   We got a Deluxe King Sky view room which offered great views of Marina Bay.  The Infinity Pool is stunning but beware, extremely busy all day!   The one thing that let us down was the fact that we went to dine one evening at the Wolfgang Puck lounge and the service was terrible. The waitress who seated us seemed uninterested and distracted and then a waiter came to take our order and I had to inform him that we hadn't even been given menus yet. We were appalled at the service and so walked out.",4,
"The prize is not really attractive compared to some other hotel in Singapore who proposed a suite for that prize.  Also the breakfast is not include in the prize of the room. No reduction for the restaurant also.  But this hotel is incredible , more than 2000 rooms 3 towers and a nice view on the sky buildings . ",3,
"Just the perfect place to stay in Singapore, everything was exceptional including service in the many restaurants, housemaids, to the reception staff !!  Location is close to everything and not far by taxi to orchard road for your shopping about $11 in a taxi !!",5,
"We had decided to lash out and have 1 night here just to say we had stayed but never in our wildest dreams did we think it would be so special. We were travelling with our adult daughter so had booked 2 standard rooms. As we were already in Singapore we decided to leave our bags at the MBS and come back after lunch to check in. I was told that there was an early check in possibility so joined a very long line of other people waiting to do the same. As I was waiting at the end of the line I was approached by a staff member who offered to take me to an alternate check in desk to speed things up. This is where I must mention Yukiwa, the staff member that checked us in. She told me that she could upgrade us to a 2 bedroom suite if we wanted to. I must admit initially I was a little…",5,
"Just for one night in Singapore & Marina Bay Sands hotel, everything was perfect the room was standard and had everything we needed! This hotel is very impressive & expensive of course, but it worth all the money.",5,
"This hotel is a signature of Singapore. Rooms are very spacious, top roof pool is one of a kind experience and the view from there is breathtaking. You can see the whole business district, Flower Dome, Gardens by the Bay, Cargo harbour and much more.",5,
Our second visit to the hotel and it was even better than the first. The suite we booked was huge and we had views of the city and the sea so we had the best of both worlds. Ce La Vie restaurant and the bar was worth it for the views alone and the dessert was to die for. Would recommend to anyone.,5,
"The best customer service hotel that I had ever stayed. The staffs are friendly, great and very helpful with arranging a memorable stay for my wife and me.   In the morning, we received a call from the front office informing us that our room are ready and we can check in at any point of time. Upon arrival, we saw a long queue at the check-in area and we noticed that the front desk officer is going round the queue to get every guest details so that they can get everyone check in as soon as possible. apart from that, there are also service staffs going along the queue to give out ice cream and juice to the guests.   It was awesome that the front office gives us an upgrade from a club room to an Orchid Suite and furthermore, the staff shows us all the way to our Suite. The suite…",5,
"I will say right off the bat that I hate Singapore.  If you want to come to Asia, but are afraid to leave your comfort zone, then this is your place.  For me, though, it is sterile, regimented, over-commercialized and just plain unremarkable - everything that Asia is not.  That being said, if you find yourself stuck in Singapore, then you will want to go to Marina Bay Sands after you've spent a fortune at Sentosa Island.  Although I prefer a cool Indian restaurant across the bay with a great view and decent food at reasonable prices, the mall offers some attractions for those passing time before they can escape the city.  The mall features a Disney-style riverwalk with bars, restaurants and (of course) lots of over-priced shopping.  The one main attraction for me is the…",3,
"What a hotel, an icon in it's own right. The pool deck, the sky deck and the general use areas of the hotel are all amazing. The views from every vantage point are amazing and should be treated with due respect, don't rush. The service from the staff was also exceptional, special mention to Henry at the concierge desk who's recommendations were spot on. I challenge you to ask him where to go for a meal and be let down by his recommendation, no pressure Henry..... The reason for my subject line? the rooms are a little over used, peeling wall paper, scuffed kick boards and generally well used working areas, Our room had issues with the toilet and the curtains.",4,
This hotel is one of the best I have stayed. Room fantastic with a view of the bay. Great customer service. The infinity pool is fantastic at night and during the day. This is a must visit place if you are visiting Singapore. I will definitely be back!,5,
"Beautiful hotel. Although a bit busy it's like an airport people always moving around. The staff are great , very helpful our bag handle was broken they gave us a room extension till our flight and a limo to the airport. Every city needs a hotel like this! ",5,
"Have been in SNG many times. Decided this time to book the Marina Bay Sands which was really more like a...not the thing we expected, unusual for SNG.  Staff: Some of them are very unkind and definitve not willing to assist in easy questions or belongings.  Room: Is okay, but not really good, clean and safe.  Pool: Very nice view. But very crowded and a nervous atmosphere. Went up 3 times for each a short time on three different days, even if we didn't get a place the first visit. The second on another day was with a place in the children playing area. And don't even try to order something along the pool. Once we had to wait up to 45min to get a chance for an order.   Hotel: A big big bunker like the ones in Vegas. No special atmosphere. And one of the other guests told us about…",2,
MBS is a huge and vibrant hotel. It is worthwhile upgrading to the Club Level. Where you have a fantastic selection of food and beverages  The standard of service from the CLub Level team outstanding. And the rooms are large and well appointed. And then there is the stunning pool the highest in the world over looking Asia's Tiger nation. ,5,
"Me and my friends went to singapore after our stay in thailand. We decided to treat ourselves for a night and stay at Marina Bay Sands which was the best choice ever. We stayed at one of the top floors with the view of the botanical gardens where you can watch the light show that happens everyday. The infinity pool was the best experience ever if you go just before sunset you can take picture during the day, as the sun goes down and night. If you stay at the right time you can even catch the lazer show that happens every day. The whole experience was just amazing. Staff were friendly and the shopping mall was just 😍. The food court there has everything you may want to have!",5,
"The property is really not a 5 star hotel. Its a really large convention type hotel. Dont expect amazing customer service either. The price is not worth going for if you just want to use the pool. If you are attending a conference or are going to the casino to gamble then the location is the best in town. But other than the location for the convention space, the casino, or the pool you should stay at a different hotel",3,
"Guess we're not alone in booking MBS hotel just for the roof top pool after seeing it on countless videos/TV shows (F1) and in photos. So was it worth the quite frankly ridiculously expensive night rate??? Well yes and no. The roof pool is amazing, in fact the whole hotel is one amazing piece of engineering. The roof offers views to die and in infinity pool will provide some of the best photos of your life. However it seems the whole world also want that great selfie photo so the pool is very busy which sort of takes away its appeal.  Rooms (booked standard room) was very nice and the rest of the hotel is spectacular though is pretty expensive.",4,
"We were treated like royalty from the moment we stepped out of the car & the porters greeted us to take our luggage. All of the staff are well trained, on the ball yet courteous & friendly. The establishment, room, amenities & food are all well worth the stay. We were upgraded for our wedding anniversary which was an unexpected surprise, as was the bottle of champagne, anniversary cake & towel monkey on the bed on our arrival. We had an amazing view from the 55 club on the 55th floor. The 55 club buffet, breakfast, afternoon tea & pre dinner drinks & snacks are extensive,the infinity pool & bar on the 57th floor & our 52nd floor suite. You can request a view of the city or the Marina bay gardens. Your choice. Either is equally as good for different reasons. The gardens & the…",5,
"Service excellent, room amazing. Every time you enter the room and put worsley card in the curtains open themselves to reveal the amazing views. I loved coming back to the room just to see it. Obviously the pool is out of this world and the reason everyone wants to stay there, it's much better now only hotel guests are allowed to use it but it's still always busy. ",5,
"It’s been about 15 years since we’ve been to Singapore so we thought we’d check out the ‘new’ (to us) Marina Bay area. This hotel has attracted much publicity for the incredible infinity pool on top of the three-tower building. When we arrived, our check-in person was Nelson Ryan. What a beautiful and delightful young man. Marina Bay Sands Hotel – HOLD ONTO THIS EMPLOYEE – he is one of the reasons we’ll return to your hotel. The other reason we’ll return to your hotel is that fabulous infinity pool and all the services that are provided on level 57. From a glass of wine to a casual dining experience – we loved every minute “up there”. Gee, it’s much more than a pool on top of a building. As a resident, you need to check out the entire area. While it was a bit pricy, we do not…",5,
Room fantastic with a view of the bay. Room clean spacious great coffee machine  Pool robes and slippers. ideal to wear on visit the the infinity pool. The infinity pool is fantastic at night and during the day. Pool side snacks and meals very varied and good Restaurants varied and we experienced the lunchtime buffet with a good selection of food and complimentary drinks. A wonderful experience.,5,
"We stayed in a Club Room which allowed access to Club 55 , which was great. Very modern and well maintained hotel. We had a wonderful view of the city from our room on the 39 th floor. Fabulous service from all the staff we encountered. Particularly Alyssa and Stephanie in Club 55 and our room housekeeper . It is in an excellent location for seeing the city sights. The pool was busy at times. However several times we were at the pool and it was quiet. It's a huge hotel. The MRT access in the basement was brilliant. We loved our stay and would recommend it! ",5,
A boat ride in the Marina was very interesting and informative. It gave a brief history of the formation of Singapore from a mere fishing village till now. It was a contrast looking at old buildings with modern buildings. Well done.,5,
Stay here if you love casino hotels and have no expectation on customer service especially from the front office and reservations teams. There are too many examples to share - all I will say is that I was looking forward to checking in at the Four Points Sheraton which is the budget category for Sheraton hotels!  The hotel room that I was in (although huge) was grungy looking and the amenities cheap with not even a USB port. All this for SGD550 a night. What a rip off.  Guess they were hoping that one would spend most of the time looking at the view of the city or the sea or the gardens by the bay (depending which room you got).  It was not all bad - the guys at the Sweet Spot cafe and Henry at the concierge saved the day. They provided the some of the best experience that I…,2,
Nice bed n pillow to sleep on. We stay in a suite room which can hv both city view n ocean view. Wakeup early in the morning u can catch the beautiful sunrise with just lying on the living room couch.,5,
"This hotel is one of the best we have stayed.  Great customer service and very nice rooms.  Swimming pool on top of the hotel is out of this world.  I would rate as the best.  There are many shops inside the hotel complex and many other activities.  If you are visiting Singapore,  this is a must visit place.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",5,
"We had a nice time in this place. The qeue for registration was fast. We got a room at the 28th floor with the city view and it was amazing especially at night. Staffs were efficient.We Ordered for in-house breakfast to our room and in the pool side,both arrived on time. Food is good. Check out was hassle free. We like the infinity pool  but i noticed some small piece of plastic and cigarette butt floating in the water at the far edge of the pool...i hope they will maintain the pool well...else, it would be a disappointment to most guest... Generally, it was a good experience. ",4,
"Even though the staff are friendly and helpful, the food is absolutely lip smacking and the rooms are clean; the star of the hotel has to be the infinity pool. You can see all of Singapore's business district. The best time to be up there is at either sunrise or sunset. There is a poolside bar-like service, I recommend the 'Shirley Temple' as a non-alcoholic drink.",5,
"Worth to try ... but just once ... great service, but you feel the mass production there ... hundreads of people everywhere around all the time ... very very crowded  Swimming pool at the roof is outstanding experience, especially in the evening when you can overlook Singapore from top, while being in the pool ...  ",4,
"If you're the kind of person who likes the flash, trash & busyness of Las Vegas hotels and you don't care about customer service, you may well like it here. However if, like me, you prefer a more refined experience and a semblance of customer service for your $800/night, you may well find it as horrible as I did.  The combination of hordes of guests, atrocious customer service and mediocre rooms serves to render a stay here less than enjoyable. The customer service is perhaps this hotel's biggest Achilles heel. It starts from the minute your cab pulls up at the entrance; no porters so you have to lug your luggage inside yourself. Thereafter, expect a 30min wait with the hordes to check in. When you finally get to your room and settled in (again, no porters, so carry your bags…",1,
"Amazing place to visit!!! It was like my dream house. When I was younger, I use to come here all the time. I heard that the Sands Hotel in Macau was better though.My favourite part of the Sands hotel in Singapore was the swimming pool. It had a great view.",5,
"We stayed in the MBS for 2 nights - Premium View Room in the 24th floor with view to downtown. We booked the hotel direct via the hotel website without any problems. The Check-In was quick and easy, no queue to wait. The room was very nice and clean. The bathroom was big with two washbasins, a bathtub and a separate shower. Staff was always very friendly. Free wifi works good. We enjoyed the pool 3 to 4 times daily, it’s really amazing with this view. We never had a problem to find free chairs on the pool. Sure sometimes we got no chair in the first row, but this wasn’t a problem for us. Access to the pool and also to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck is possible with the keycard of your room. Pool opens from 6am - 11pm.",5,
"The hotel is very nice, rooms are good with a wonderful view to the skyline. From the airport we take a taxi for S$ 18,-. The check-in was perfect because we did a pre-check-in and due this reason we had a quick check-in at tower 1 at the left site. Breakfast at the lobby was very good (several selection around the world) , also the breakfast at level 57 with a wonderful view to the sea but with a smaller selection.",4,
We loved everything of the stay and our family trip.  The infinity pool is Spectacular. The food and customer service were excellent. It is located at Bayfront MRT and very convenient. Thank you for the recommendation: The Light Cove Photography. We registered for an outdoor photoshoot session to capture the moment of a lifetime with my family in Singapore.,5,
"I was in Singapore on business and decided to stay next to the convention centre. Great location and good for the conference.  The gym is good and the view outstanding. My first impression was good and the reception member of staff made me feel very welcome, and the room I had was lovely. Really good quality. I was all set for a nice trip and the service from the in-room dining was great.  I was however let down on a couple of areas. The housekeeping was a mix of good and bad. The good day all was clean but there was no refill of the basic in room complimentary tea etc. In order to have a simple request filled, it took some patience and calls to the reception for some tea. I finally on the last day waited 45 minutes and 3 calls to get some whitener before leaving for the event.…",3,
"The room has city view and spacious bathroom with full amenities. The gym and infinity pool are excellent. The service is professional and reliable. This hotel perfect for family, couple and business purpose. High price but really worth the price.",5,
"Stayed for 3 nights for a conference. This hotel is ideal is for large groups having the hotel as a venue for a massive event. I personally wouldn't stay here if i'm on a leisure trip as I find the crowds quite massive. Having said that, the service is excellent and efficient. I had a couple of housekeeping requests throughout my stay and each request was attended swiftly and with much personal touch.",4,
If you want to spoil yourself go to Marina Bay Sands.  It is worth the extra money to stay here.  The room we had was very spacious & kept so clean.  The view was spectacular. The  staff were amazing - friendly & helpful.    Bayfront MRT is downstairs which makes it very easy to get around Singapore.  I would definitely go back to Marina Bay Sands next time I visit Singapore.,5,
It is one of my favourite and best places in singapore . its a MUST VISIT place. i'll say if u don't go to Marina Bay Sands no need to go to singapore.  It has a lovely ambience amazing breakfast. Best place is roof top bar. As per my choice Evening time for this is bar is appropriate time.,5,
"I like this hotel, everytime i come on a business trip it has to be marina bay, great customer service, good food, nice weather nice views from room and rooftop swimming pool...once thing i like about this hotel its always full but the layout makes it feel like its always empty, i really like it...see you soon , thank you so much marina bay...",5,
"4 nights at Marina Bay Sands,what a pleasure.Breakfast by the infinity pool is totally delicious. Staff are helpful.Yes you can get lost going around all the facilities  (shops casino)Being able to walk out to the magnificent gardens was a delight.MRT is close by and for a small price $12 a pass can be brought lasts for 5 years as long as it's topped up.",4,
"Stayed there for 3 nights and it was too much. The hotel is huge, modern, beautiful! And it's totally worth it for the pool but just to take few pictures because it's too crowded. Also the breakfast is really good! There are 3 places, and very very good!  The service could improve a lot. Front desk and concierge do not look you in the eyes not even once, they lack in hospitality services so so much and a smile in their faces could make a big difference. It doesn't matter if they give ice cream at the check in or an amazing view in the room, if they don't know how to treat guests properly, smile and eye contact are super important in hospitality!!!!  Also, they don't explain anything. I've never seen a hotel where I had to find my way to my room on my own, and being a hotel as…",4,
"Marina Bay Sands was an experience that I am glad to say we have! Singapore is a beautiful city and we were able to experience from the top of our hotel. The first night we went to dinner at the restaurant on the top floor. The food was great, service was a little slow and the view was breathtaking! The hotel itself was beautiful. Very well maintained and run. We enjoyed our room and the view from our room. The infinity pool on the top floor is just stunning. We had great service and the staff was very friendly. Definitely something everyone should see!",5,
"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in April and it was just amazing. The staff were great and the rooms were very spacious and clean. They're currently renovating the rooms but even the rooms that aren't renovated are great. The rooftop pool is just incredible, we went up every day and night and although t gets very crowded it's still worth it. One negative of the hotel is the time you spend in elevators is ridiculous and they aren't ventilated at all. To get to the pool could take 4-5 minutes in an elevator with all the stops and it gets that hot in them that it's horrible. Also strange why they've made it so difficult to get to and from the Gardens by the Bay. Otherwise, we had a great week and can't wait to go back. ",5,
"If you are visiting Singapore a stay at Marina Bay Sands is an absolute requirement.  The hotel is very impressive.  As soon as we pulled up in our cab, a porter was there to greet us and take our luggage and give us a luggage tag.  He then asked us to proceed to the check in counter.  I arrived at noon, and thought that I would have to store my luggage and would have to come back to get my room.  That didn't happen.  The front office staff that i dealt with was absolutely amazing.  He greeted me and gave me my room right away.  Further he personally walked us to our suite.  10 minutes later another individual came up to explain all the features of the room.  The room was fabulous.  We had a corner suite.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND upgraded to a suite.  We had a view of the city and a…",5,
"This hotel might be the most spectacular and iconic building I have been in for a city such as Singapore. Its infinity pool is the largest in the world and truly amazing. Well worth to spend at least 1-2 hours. The room was very nice with a regular design and a modern bathroom. Very nice amenities and staff services as they are very friendly and always happy to assist you. The only problem with the hotel is that it was overcrowded and made it very difficult to even navigate around the building and for the staff to work. But apart from that, Marina Bay Sands is one of the most amazing hotels I have been in.",4,
"Marina Bay Sands.....One complex of five stars hotel, remarkable exhibition and , convention center, musical concert area, shopping centre, restaurants MRT Station and casino. View of Singapore Strait and borderless swimming pool and some cafes in the top floor. Gardens By The Bay, Marina Barrage and Art Centre in the surroundings area. One of most sightseeing place when we are travelling to this country.",5,
We had only 12 hr  stopover Paris / sydney . I would definetly do the Singapore route stopover than stop in Dubai . The Marina sands is a terrific luxury hotel with magnificent views. The rooms are spacious and bed super dreamy . Pool drink prices Extremely high @ $18 a glass beer .-$53 ph breakfast. ( not included in room rate ) The pool is fabulous but really would be better served with designated areas for families and adult only areas . This magnificent pool  feels like a disorganised public pool space and somewhat disappointing given the luxury with the rest of the hotel . Would not stay there again.  On the other hand it's great for families . ,4,
"Spent one night at this hotel while on Singapore and all I can say is the hotel is overrated! I think everybody has the same idea as we did, spent one night and enjoy the hotel, because the line up to check in and out was over an hour long. The major attraction of the hotel is the pool which is beautiful but way too busy and crowded from 7am – 11pm. In my opinion spending all that money for one night was not worth it; the only spectacular thing about this hotel is the pool, the rooms are like any other rooms in a good hotel ... to be honest the wow factor was not there.",2,
"A stay at Marina Bay Sands is one for the bucket list. Get up early to enjoy a sunrise swim, stay up late to take advantage of the great views from the bars. The location is so convenient, with a shopping centre directly accessible from the hotel, the ArtScience Museum right on the doorstep and Gardens by the Bay only a short walk away. For anyone taking a late flight, there is a day rate allowing you to keep the room until evening. Expensive, but it was worth it!",5,
"We spent one night in Marina Bay Sands.  Firstly, for the swimming-pool : what an amazing view at the top on the city of Singapore !  The room was welcoming, with a view on the gardens. Notice the hotel ask for an extra charge of 25 dollars should you wish a view overlooking the city.  I am also very grateful to Dennis at the pool entrance who was always smiling and helpful with us.  Next time in Singapore i will plan to visit this hotel once more.",5,
It is a unique hotel and very expensive to say the least great views from the top deck and the infinity pool on the 57th floor is very nice. I paid an extra hundred or so dollars to stay on the upper floors and ended up getting the 46th floor I would recommend to stay any place in the hotel they do let you go up to the top deck and the pool so you end up getting great views without shelling out extra hundred bucks. ,4,
One of the best tourist destination here. You will enjoy the fine beach with nice view all over Use MRT to reach this place Take children too for overall time spending Evening time will be amazing with colourful lights display too,5,
"We treated ourselves to a night at Marina Bay Sands as part of a recent 6 night stay in Singapore.  It literally broke the bank, so we had high expectations and were expecting something amazing.  And we got it!  We were checked in at 11am, and were able to access our room straight away.  Check-in was smooth, and Rhea made us feel super special.  We were a bit disappointed that we didn't get a higher room allocation, but our room on the 7th floor had views over the Gardens by the Bay, so any disappointment was short-lived.  The room was amazing, and the bathroom spectacular.    We hit the pool straight away and it was out of this world!    At night we enjoyed a drink up on level 57 and the magnificent view overlooking Singapore.  We ate breakfast the next morning at Spago, and…",5,
"You do not stay at Marina Bay Sands for personalised service but you stay for the spectacular pool, location, and views. Its a huge complex and its easy to feel insignificant and just another person in the crowd. It also has that unfortunate effect that hotels attached to casinos have of being more style over substance. There are amazing shops and so many restaurants but it feels a bit like a theme park.  The pool truly is amazing but it gets VERY busy so be prepared to not be able to actually swim because its filled with people taking selfies. We had a harbour view room and the sunrises were gorgeous and its awesome looking out at the Botanic Gardens at night.  Now that we've experienced the hotel and pool I probably wouldn't stay here again as I enjoy more personalised service…",4,
Pros : concierge services  Quick check in.  Amazing rooms. Infinity pool.  Ce la vi.   Cons :  No proper system to distinguish room guests and outsiders.   No airport pick up.   And I really wish they did crowd the area around swimming up so much. It is suffocating. ,5,
"A short note of welcome and a little decor in the room by the housekeeping team is most exemplary. Sometimes, those little things occupy the biggest part of one's heart. I would be happy to visit again!  ",5,
"What can I say, it's the iconic Marina bay sands and it did not fail to disappoint. A bucket list must stay even if just for one night. Service on the top deck was second to none, using first names etc and giving us a free cocktail due to our salad not being great. Will be back again.",5,
"We had high expectations, but they were far exceeded in the first few minutes.  Before we even had time to open the door of our taxi, the porter was there to collect our bags and direct us to check in.  We had priority check in, and even though it was only 9am in the morning, they found us a room, upgraded us and off we went to Tower 3.  As we were approaching our room, there were our bags in front of us!  The room we booked was an Orchid Suite, but when we walked in, it was 4 times bigger that I ever dreamt of.  It was huge and perfect in every way.  I could live perfectly in that room as it is so comfortable.  We were to stay somewhere else for 4 days later in the journey, but within the first hour we had cancelled that and booked the same room again. Included was breakfast,…",5,
"We stayed here for Christmas and although we were prepared to pay the price, it became evident that we were really only paying for the use of the pool which is for hotel guests only.  Admittedly this meant the pool was not over crowded and we could enjoy the incredible views; but the service or lack there of did not match how expensive the hotel was.   I would recommend if you are after the more personalized stay, to stay at MBS for only one night to catch the once in a life time pool experience at both sunrise and set and spending the rest of your vacation in another hotel.",4,
"Cannot fault this hotel at all. It is expensive but totally worth it. Have stayed a couple of times now and will always come back. The bar, restaurants, pool, service and rooms are all second to none.",5,
"There is no other hotel like this in Singapore. Amazing view, service and rooms.  The reception looks like at the airport, full of people, noisy, crowdy and busy. I can recommend to hire a Club room or Grand Club room. The room was on 20th floor with the view to the gardens. The room itself was really spacious with huge balcony with amazing view especially at night. You can use special reception and concierge is you are guest in Club room. It is really useful.  The rooms was clean, spacious and looks like new, The service was really professional, fast and helpful. Rooms service was very good (only 30 minutes waiting for a food).  The restaurant in a Club is really beautiful. You can use it for breakfast and for afternoon tea which includes amazing buffet so you dont need a…",5,
"My wife and I only spent not even 24 hours, but it was enough to feel amazing and a romantic couple again. The check-in was smooth and fast: waited maybe 10 second in the line and the extremely nice receptionist greeted us with a ""Sorry for keep you waiting"" 😅. The room was very clean, spacious and the view on the bay is just superb (we were at floor 44). Very nice gym. Special mention for the infinity pool: ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Dinner in the Spago restaurant was excellent (booked only 3 hours before! And it was Saturday night!!!). On top of that the staff was extremely kind and attentive all over the huge hotel.   What surprised me is the late check-in time, only starting at 3 pm and the early check-out at 11 am. These 2 points can be improved (at least check-out at 12 pm!),…",5,
Let's get one thing clear - MBS is incredible!  I had high expectations having been wishing to stay there for many years. I was not disappointed. The service on arrival was exceptional. We were treated better than at any other hotel or residence I have been to before. We booked a Premier King View room and what a view it was. 34 stories up and looking over the city. It is truly astounding.  Then to that pool. It is far better than any pictures could demonstrate. Was it busy? Yes. But was it difficult to find a lounger? Not at all. The place is huge. Never were all loungers taken. I hadn't accounted for so many children being there so it was a little shock. That meant having the dedicated adults area was very welcome. This was rigourously enforced by the very visible lifeguards…,5,
A wonderful place feels like heaven on earth.The top floor is swimming pool which is only for the people staying at the hotel.The stay was awesome literally enjoyed staying here!!Do visit it if you are planning a vacay here :),5,
"I was really looking forward to spending a night at the Marina Bay Sands hotel as it looks incredibly beautiful from afar. But I guess as they say, good from afar but far from good.  Our check in experience was chaotic. We booked a ""club level room"" so we had to use the designated counter, however we were sent to 3 different locations until we found the right one. While we were shuffling from desk to desk we encountered one poor customer experience after another The hotel itself is nice enough, but because it is so large it is jammed packed full of people. You needed to make booking for almost every restaurant days in advance, which does not bode well for a relaxing stay. When we did eat the restaurants were overpriced  for subpar food. Singapore has some of the best eateries in…",2,
"Everything about our 4-night stay was absolutely fantastic. Easy to get to via the MRT underneath the hotel. At check-in, we were upgraded from the 'standard' room to a high-floor club room with city view at no extra cost. The room and its view was magnificent. Spotlessly clean, spacious and well furnished. The infinity pool has breathtaking views of the city and concrete jungle beyond, while the other side of the skypark has quieter zones with a view of the harbour. It can be quite difficult to find more than one available sun lounge  anytime after 9am.  There are lots of food options in the complex, however most are quite costly. The food court in the shoppes downstairs offered more budget-friendly alternatives, however a typical 'western breakfast' was hard to come by without…",5,
"This was our second visit to MBS though this time we were travelling with our 9 month old son. We booked the club room for the week so we may enjoy some amenities provided by Club 55. We had high expectations which were consistently exceeded much to our delight!!!  The housekeeping team welcomed us with a bottle of champagne upon our arrival and proactively provided us with a baby bath and baby products much to our delight. Our portable cot was also setup in our room prior to check in so all went smoothly even though we arrived at 10pm.  It wasn't long before our son Jordan became probably the most spoilt child at Club 55, all the staff made him and us feel very special and extremely important. The standout members that we will always remember and cannot wait to see again…",5,
very nice and impressive place with good restaurant at the top rooms are a little expensive but you have access at the pool  at the top of the building where you can see the town from the sky  so cool really great,5,
"I liken this hotel to the experience you have when one travels internationally in coach/economy. I basically remember that once I check in, I am at the mercy of the airport gods. I hand over my dignity, and suffer the experience knowing full well it will be over soon, and I'll be where I need to be. Maybe along the way a distraction from the indignity, will be a good movie; much like the pool is at this hotel.   I thought for the price we would get something special. The pool was special. However pool entry at $500 for a 45 minute swim, is a bit steep (assuming the hotel room is an included extra with the pool entry - because this is what it feels like).   The Hotel looks great, and is truly an icon of the Singapore skyline, and no doubt an engineering marvel. However the…",1,
"Another great stay at Marina Bay Sands.If you can afford a Club room or Suite you should upgrade.Included with these rooms you will have access to Club 55 (55th floor)which included in your nightly stay will give you a fabulous Buffett breakfast,afternoon tea with a great selection of sweet treats and savoury food, and the best was the late afternoon (between5 and 7)all the alcoholic drinks you can consume in 2 hours :)))))and a huge selection of hot and cold snacks.We had a fantastic stay,the service ,food and suite 5102 were fit for royalty.Skydeck with exquisite views, pool and atmosphere is always busy but a sight to be seen:)))We will be back ,looking forward to our next stay.",5,
"Blows my my mind to see this architectural marvel. Three 57 stories buildings with the boat on top. Built on reclaimed land.   It took an American Sheldon Adelson of Las Vegas who owns the Venetian to spent 8 billion dollars to built it.   In addition, there is an amazing complex across the street including a huge convention center and a very upscale 4 story shopping plaza.",5,
"The service of this at this hotel right from the concierge team receiving you at the entrance, to the check in desk to every single staff who you would cross paths with were polite, courteous and helpful. We had a room with a city view and it was beautiful. The room was big and comfortable for 2 people and all necessary amenities were provided. The infinity pool is the star and lives upto its expectations. Its beautiful! The lobby area of the hotel is busy as there are lots of people but the access to the Shoppes, metro and Gardens by the Bay is partly the reason too.  The bathroom layout was a bit strange. The toilet was within its own enclosure with a door and the same with a standing shower. However, the toilet tank was low, so every time u needed to flush the toilet, you…",4,
Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for two days with my friends before we moved onto Thailand. Very clean hotel with plenty to see and do. Rooms were  spotless and staff very friendly and always on hand to help. But of course like most guests we booked this hotel for the amazing roof top pool. It was amazing and the views awesome. We watched the sunset from the poolside bar. If your in Singapore you have to book this hotel even if its just one night. i know its expensive but so is everything in Singapore!!,5,
Be careful if you are staying on the side that faces away from the city because there are often concert event in the gardens behind the hotel and the noise is unbelievable. The event can be very loud until at least 11pm and the hotel will not warn you about it.,3,
The Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel and the room is very nice. Marina have an amazing pool with a nice view from the 57th floor. The Skypark also is great. Thanks at Dennys for the hospitality (Dennys work at the entrance of the pool). Next time i come back again for more days. ,5,
"We went to see Marina Bay Sands in February, tickets bought online. We reached easily the top, no queue, altough to find the entry is not easy. The vue is beautiful, but dont go to the very top of it, the top bar, The top bar is free to the hotel guests and visitors can enter only if they buy something to drink wich is really expensive.So dont go to the exclusive-looking top bar, the panaroma terrace is good enoug, the same vue, but nicer people!",4,
We stayed here one night because we really wanted to see the view from the pool and enjoy our time in Singapore! Obviously the rooms are very nice as is the infinity pool. However prepare to have lots of people there taking selfies non-stop. Still feels like something that should be a part of the Singapore experience though. Also breakfast is not included.,4,
"This place has a wonderful feel to it - one of those ""skyline"" that we see in many big cities. The views that look really pretty at night with all the buildings, flyer and seafront. Good to visit this place at least twice - once during day time and the other late evening.",5,
"I paid extra for the city view and it was definitely worth it (albeit at $650 a night). The room is extremely spacious and modern, absolutely no faults with it. Just keep in mind that even if you do not drink anything from the minibar, there are weight sensors that will charge your room automatically if you lift anything out.   The infinity pool itself is worth staying at the hotel for and the hotel has been designed to prevent people from sneaking into it, as it is only for hotel guests. They even had a member of staff dedicated to ensuring that people would not jump over the gates from the 56th floor bathroom. Although it was raining when I stayed, so the views were largely obscured by the clouds for a long time, I am sure the pool is extremely pleasant in good weather. There…",4,
"We booked in here for one night during our holiday. Although expensive, it's definitely worth it for a one off must do experience!   The hotel itself is brilliantly designed and easy to get around. The shopping centre attached to the hotel is brilliant just to walk around.   Our room was clean, ultra modern, spacious and impressively finished. Little touches, such as the concierge phoning us literally as we went into the room to inform us they were bringing up our bags and the curtains being electronically controlled were lovely.   The swimming pool is a must see but remember to take a room key up for each guest to get entry. Although the pool was busy, it still felt spacious and the staff were attentive.   The only downside to the hotel is because it's so big it's not…",5,
"This hotel is massively hyped due to its views and pool... both of which are spectacular. However, the pool is FREEZING and very crowded. The Views you can get without staying at the hotel and just going up to the bar.  As for the hotel, it is a bizzare, not sure of its identity - work/fun/tourist/business...?  It is clean and rooms well sized, the service is pretty good too. Lots of restaurants and food options too.",4,
"What a pleasure staying there! The rooms are amazing, all you need and more. Great lobby, such a choice of restaurants! Great swimming pool area with amazing panoramic pool. Good food there as well. Great gitness and spa area. My favorite!",5,
"Best to say that staying at the MBS is a trade off of a being in one of the most impressive buildings in the world, access to incredible restaurants and shopping, unimaginable views -- but rooms that are nice but simple.  Not to undersell the ""nice"" but for the price, there are extraordinary rooms elsewhere in Singapore with exceptional service. The rooms at MBS are moderate sized, baths are clean and modern but not luxurious, amenities are standard and what you would expect at a traditional business hotel all over the world.  Overall, a fine stay, nothing to complain about, but if you'd like to enjoy the very highest levels of luxury, room design and service, look elsewhere.",4,
The first important fact about this property is the unique and wonderful architecture of it's building.  It's location is very good you simply can walk to the garden's by the bay or merlion park. Or you can use the metro very quick.  Sky park and infinity pool is amazing.  As the property is huge the services is not really good.  The breakfast wasn't worthy of 5star property! I think you should stay there but no more than once. ,4,
My hubby and i stayed at this amazing hotel for 2 wonderful nights. Swimming in the infinity pool and eating from the Restaurant was magnificent. The view over Singapore was breath taking. The hotel was massive! All the staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful :),5,
We decided to stay at this hotel to enjoy the  infinity pool. It is a beautiful hotel with excellent service. The room is spacious and has all the required amenities. The front desk is always very crowded with a lot of guests around. There is a luggage storage area for you to use in case of departing in a late flight. The gym is excellent with a beautiful view for Singapore.,5,
"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands was on our bucket list.  We stayed there for several days prior to going on a cruise.  We had a terrific view with a view of the city from about the 42th floor in a Club Room.  The room was fantastic. We have been to Las Vegas many times, and the lobby area reminded us of Vegas, with so many people coming and going. (We went to the casino just to walk through it, but was not really impressed, as compared to the Vegas casinos.) The Infinity pool was fun to see.  My wife went in the water, and it was not as crowded as we were led to believe, although there were of course those taking selfies.  I got a good shot of her in the pool and the view of the city without anyone else in the pic.  There are several good restaurants up at the top, although they…",5,
"2 nights staycation at the famous MBS. Room on level 24 facing the gardens by the bay. The room is bigger than i thought with 2 double beds which can accommodate 4 adults if join together. Plenty of walking space within the room and nice spacious bathroom with separate toilet and standing shower rooms, including a bathtub. Our room comes with a balcony too which is great and room is quiet throughout the entire day. Bed is comfy.   The room is well maintenance and updated.  Of course, MBS is famous for its infinity pool and tends to be crowded. The pool is divided into adult only section and the family with kids section, which is more crowded. The is a casual restaurant up on level 57 and the staff are quite attentive and walk around to check if the guests by the pool looking to…",4,
"Perfect rooms! The bed is amazingly comfortable, the bathroom is impeccable and the view is beautiful. The room's area is very quiet, great to rest. Staff is always available. The famous pool is a unique attraction that worthy every cent. The hotel is also an attraction itself with a beautiful architecture, casino and shopping mall inside. The hotel is very well located, nearby the main tourist places of the city, and with easy access to the subway.",5,
"Lovely views from top of hotel. Wouldn't say it totally worth the money they charged.  Half of it is blocked off to guests, but can see the pool AMD garden",3,
"We stayed here for 1 at the beginning of our trip to Singapore.  Check in was absolutely perfect! We'd arrived on an overnight flight and got to the hotel at around 9.30am, we weren't expecting a room to be ready but were pleasantly surprised when we were quickly checked in and handed our room key for the 42nd floor in tower 3.  After check-in we headed straight up to the famous infinity pool, it wasn't too busy and we found sunbeds in the adults section with ease. The pool is lovely and the views are stunning, however the water was much to cold for our liking. Coming from Dubai the weather was not quite as hot as we imagined and getting in a freezing pool with a cooling breeze was not all that enjoyable! Aside from this we had a nice chilled morning.  The room was great, big…",4,

"Stayed at MBS for the third time a couple weeks ago, this time in an Orchid Suite. I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. While I like to go to new places and experience new adventures, this place is too nice to not return. The Skypark and Club 55 are wonderful. All personnel we encountered were efficient, professional and friendly.",5,

"Last year we stopped over at the characterful Fullerton Hotel and looked across at the amazing architecture of the MBS. This year we decided to stay at the MBS for our stopover in a city-view room. The view was great but perhaps not as great as the view in the opposite direction. The room was huge, clean and comfortable but somewhat soulless. One issue for us was that the bathroom door did not shut completely, the other was that the aircon was very noisy.   Of course we went up to the pool on the roof and took pictures. It was packed full of people taking selfies - and non-residents on the observation deck taking pictures of residents. Cocktails were good but very expensive (24 S$ each) and slow to arrive. The lobby was likewise full of tourists taking in the huge atrium. All…",3,
we loved the pool and shops at this hotel. the service was a bit on the low end and we did have a nice room but it could have been a bit bigger. overall we want to go back for sure but get a suite this time and stay longer.,5,
"I haven't been there in 2017 but I guess I can only write for that date 😒 ANYWAYS, the price is VERY expensive 💵 but it's worth it. I can't remember for how long we stayed probably 3 days but wow 😳. The room was beautiful and the beds were really comfy 😴. The view was breathtaking and well, very high too 😬😱 but just looking it's beautiful 😍 the pool was ENORMOUS and also very high up too 😂. At night 🌙 at the pool, the view was also just better than at daylight. It was the coolest experience ever!!!",5,
Stayed for 3 nights in October - this hotel is simply stunning we were upgraded to a suite when we said we were there for our 30th wedding Anniversary. Absolutely wonderful room with breathtaking taking views. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is amazing and must be tried during the day and at night. We preferred the restaurant on the ground floor for breakfast the choice is wonderful and great service. The hotel is simply one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and Singapore is beautiful. Will definitely come back for a return visit - please.,5,
"We came a few years ago for some drinks, and We decided to book a room to experience the hotel whilst in transit in Singapore . Great service and efficiency at check in (walk-in) , beautiful room and view on the gardens by the bay, amazing pool !! Loved it",5,
i have visited marina bay sand last week. the view is scenery and really nice and a must go place to visit and take good pictures. It consists of few gardens and few interesting places. It is very suitable for people to jog around.,5,
"As backpackers me and two mates decided to spend one night here. It was expensive but certainly didnt dissapoint. Firstly, when we arrived we wasnt expecting to be given a room on the 44th floor with an amazing view of the gardens and bay. Then we was allowed to check in well ahead of time giving us plenty of time in the pool. I ordered room service twice and I literally could not fault the service. The room was luxurious as was the entire hotel. If I can afford to come back again I will definitely consider here! Just amazing.",5,
This must be one of the best skyline views I have ever seen and with an open rooftop which is greatly. Hugely overpriced to get up and have a drink but to be expected at such a major attraction. Shopping centre also very high end and impressive.,4,
We came to eat at the amazing top floor restaurant and were not disappointed .Views are incredible and a bonus that the food was superb Thanks go to Charmaine Ho who arranged our visit   Be careful as there are 2 different areas on the top floor with different access points,5,
"Stayed with wife for four nights. It was a mixed stay and I really wanted to give this hotel five stars, but ultimately it just is not a five star hotel.  So, the good: It's simply amazing, the sheer scale of everything from the building itself, to the views, to the infinity pool. The rooms are huge and the bed was wonderful. And the view from the bedroom window was breathtaking. We used the room service and the food was excellent, and quite reasonably priced. Service was polite and efficient. The room key system was also the most reliable I have used. Internet was excellent and the room and loads of USB/international plug sockets. Electric curtains! What can I say, brilliant (but didn't work perfectly). But: The infinity pool is for taking selfies, in real life it is a pretty…",4,
"This building is impressive both inside and out. It dominates the skyline of the Marina Bay and for some, this will be the ideal place to stay. My only concern is the interior of the building. It is absolutely huge, like a modern day cathedral, full of tourists with their selfie sticks and I found it somewhat impersonal and far too busy. Instead we elected to stay across the bay at the Fullerton. ",4,
"Just wow. What a place! Totally lives up to all expectations. We had a room looking over the gardens and the bay, we were in the 45th floor and the view was incredible.  Breakfast on the 57th floor just behind the infinity pool was amazing!  Had a run in the treadmill on the 55th floor, there's no reason to ever be bored on a treadmill with a tremendous view over Singapore.  Amazing place to stay. Hope one day we are lucky enough to go back. ",5,
Me and my friends checked-in for an overnight staycation at Marina Bay Sands. We really had fun especially in the Infinity pool. But what I really appreciate the most was the  superb service provided to us by Ms. Joanne Gonzaga. She really took care of us from the time that we checked-in. She made sure that we have everything we need and that we are comfortable with our stay. So please make sure that my sincere THANK YOU will reach her. And I am looking forward to staying in MBS again not only because of the hotel but also because of her.   /conz,5,
"Late entry. Luxury hotel! But I think there is a bunch of better hotels out there. I have been to many 5 star hotels and even some 4 star hotels are better in terms of the hotel rooms and amenities. Other than the beautiful city view which I paid for, everything else seems second best for me. My welcome letter, which I expect to be in the TV screen, like most of the 5 star hotels, was printed on a sheet that seemed like to be reused for the last 3 weeks, I can say that because it was still dated 3 weeks ago. Lighting inside the room looked so regular, not much variation, except of the beautiful skyline lights at night. Bathroom was very spacious but there could have been more lighting to enhance the features. I like how the bath tub sits in one corner, very good for…",3,

"It was indeed worse and inconvenience for me during my stay. The staff less professional training, less polite, not to mentioned the efficiency.  I checked in twice. The first time it wasted me 20-30 mins to wait except  in the queue time, the receptionist was searching the room availability that I booked at tower 1. And I was so starving, it was at noon. Your staff who took our luggages said we can check in at 12pm. But why he said the room that I booked was temporary not available? And I needed to wait util 3 pm. Or if I needed a room right away then I needed to pay more. Was this professional?  The good thing was at least he gave me temporary cards to access the pool. But I still needed to wait, because we didn't have our outfits with us, it was in the luggages of course. So…",1,
"I've just seen TripAdvisor's ""14 Extraordinary Hotel Pools"" from around the world and feel compelled to say that the most extraordinary thing about that lineup is - It doesn't even include this magnificent and iconic Infinity pool on the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore! One end of this pool is a shallow section safe for kids.The Hotel itself, and the staff I might add, are wonderful. This pool is ""the icing on the cake"". Well worth going to Singapore just for this experience alone.  It would be classed as a ""luxury"" hotel, but there is a range of prices, and you get exceptional luxury for their lowest price. Even though it is expensive for a lot of people (including us), it is great value for money, and well worth it. While I'm at it, I also highly recommend a…",5,
Though a little pricey to stay in this hotel but still worth it because the room was excellent. Accessibility wise to everywhere is perfect.  Our staying in that hotel was totally a memorable one especially when you are relaxing in the pool are. Amazing place!!!!,5,
"Probably too many people talking about good points here. I just want to mention the only thing that bothered me. Accessories used for toilet, bath and hand washing is not convenient at all. Adjusting temperature of water at bath was very time consuming and confusing. The only place at hotel that I did not feel 5 star was bath and toilets.",5,
From March 17 to 22 stay in Marina Bay Sands I am again thrilled by the dedication n innovative skills of folding towels in the form of birds dogs n even elephants on my bed daily after each daily housekeeping   I prefer these innovations instead of having chocolates or sweets on the bed   Overall Marina Bay Sands is definitely a class of its own n above others ,5,
fantastic swimming pool on 57th floor and breathtaking view of the city and gardens by the bay from above  is awesome. 2 floors casino running all night id another booster for staying there. worth spending at least one night there.,5,
"we were fortunate to have been upgraded to a very nice room overlooking the bay. however we were expecting the use of the beautiful ref, unfortunately you have to pay to use it, we could not understand why.  everytime Singapore is being featured, you will always notice the hotel with its magnificent infinity pool atop the hotel, meaning, the tourist bureau is proud of its presence of which we did experience.  the staff are well accommodating. the hotel is a bit pricy but considering its magnificence, a memorable stay is well worth it. one may no longer go out of the building because they have everything you need, casino, food, shopping, beautiful people.",4,
"Spent a weekend there. First time to stay there. I'm in tower three, the view is pretty good. I went up to the gym and also tried the hot tub, sauna and steam. Facilities in the gym is good and not crowded. However, if you like swimming, the pool would be too crowded with people tans there to take pictures and drink beer. The view from the infinity pool is absolutely fantastic. MRT is down at the building with food court and lots of luxury shops. There's an art science museum nearby. I would say it is more for young children than adults . Gardens by the bay is good for people who really likes flowers and plants. The downside of staying in this hotel would be too many people all the time. I prefer a quieter place to stay",4,
"Beautiful hotel, very clean, staff very attentive and polite.  Only stayed one night before cruise but would have definitely stayed longer if schedule permitted.  Was a family holiday and hotel impressed kids and grandkids alike. Ideal location, amazing view from room, infinity pool worth the cost of stay ( which wasn't cheap). Dinner at Rise was really good with lots of variety on offer.",5,
"Very beautiful hotel with scenic view. Love the convenient of getting to the shopping mall next door and the night view of the waterfront.   However, the hotel lobby lack of seats for guest to stay. Hope the Management can look into this.",5,
"That's right, You Only Live Once!!  I indulged in the Orchid Suite on the 54th floor with city view.  Suite was huge with uncomfortable pull out sofa for guest.    Location is great as it's right at the MRT station and next to mall, Art science Museum, Super Trees, and the cloud Forest.  The pool was awesome but there is a lot more to enjoy such as Nightclub Ce La Vie, and all the wonderful restaurants.  Get a Club room or a Suite so you can have access to Club 55 where you can enjoy a great breakfast, afternoon tea and snack and from 5-7pm open bar and heavy Hors D'oeuvre!!",5,
We loved this hotel so much. The rooms were large and spacious with a plentiful supply of water to beat the heat. It was easy to get anywhere in Singapore by the metro which was clean and cheap. The Shoppes were lovely to wander around and no body harassed you. We used the Casino each night and felt welcomed and looked after.  We treated ourselves to the Cheese and Chocolate Buffet in Club55 . It was an experience to relish. The view the tastes and the champagne meant this was a highlight of our holiday .  Although a little pricey ( the hotel)  it is worth it once in your life. ,5,
Expensive hotel to stay at but the pool view is worth it!!! Lots of nice photos! One thing to fuss on it's the over crowding issues.. the lobby the check in and the pool of cos!   The pool at night was very very cold and windy!  Thought the would be warm but no.. too cold too enjoyed at night .. in the day hard to find a bench to chill by the pool becos everywhere is taken and cover with towels lol..   Was hungry at night but can't find a 24hour 7-11 .. literally a dead town after 11pm in this area haha   The only thing I like about the hotel most probably would be the pool lol ,4,
"We were on the 41st floor in Tower 3, we got the lift and put the card in the slot for the electricity. There was a wow moment as the curtains drew apart to show a fantastic view over the gardens. The infinity pool on the 57th floor ( handy if you're in Tower 3 ) is wonderful. It opens at 6 in the morning, but even at 7 o'clock it's still very quiet. The staff are wonderful and helpful. As walkers, my only criticism was getting out of the hotel complex as they want you to walk past all the shops. In addition it seems easier to buy an expensive watch than just get a drink. Having said that it is an iconic hotel and I would still recommend it.",4,
"When we booked we specifically made a written request for a quiet room that was not close to the elevators or service areas. Upon checkin I specifically asked the receptionist again about our request - She assured me our room was 'not so close to the elevator'. Surprise surprise, we were in room 4250, directly beside both the linen room and the room closest to the elevator. Thanks very much, 2 days of ding dong. First thing we notice is however the stink - both in the hallway and in our room. It's like a disgusting mix of stale cigars, damp and sewage. I woke up several times in the night breathing that crap. Our toilet stank even worse of sewage, like it was bubbling up through the drains. When you get out of the lift you can also see that the hall ceiling is covered in what…",2,
"Stayed here recently for 2 nights over a weekend and booked a premier room. As a result, the the hotel was quite expensive. Check in was smooth and we had lovely service from Lea. Was given a garden views room on level 17. The corridor and rooms looked outdated and not something like a five star hotel or something that was expensive. At $560AUD a night this was the most expensive hotel that we have stayed in (and we have been to Ritz-Carlton, Crown and Shangri-La hotels before). There was no customer service during our stay besides the check-in and the hotel room looked cheap and outdated. Carpet was worn and furnishing and bathroom fitting looked cheap. Toiletries and amenities were no named brand. Maybe this hotel was nice 5 years ago but not anymore. The mini fridge was not…",1,
"The pool is gorgeous and so much fun - its photo time.  Great pool-side food and drinks.  The hotel is in a good area - connected to a wonderful mall with a casino in the mall.  Also, it is in walking distance of The Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer.  Hotels has most BEAUTIFUL views of the harbor.  The downside is there are so many people there - it is one busy hotel!",5,
"The rooftop pool and the view from the top 57th floor is doubtlessly amazing. So is the service - everyone extremely attentive and polite. No question about that. But...the rooms although spacious with very comfy beds and beautiful linens are somewhat ascetic compared with other 5-star hotels in Singapore. They could do with a bit more opulence especially the premium rooms on top floors which I went for. The real disappointment, however, was breakfast buffet in the rooftop restaurant. For the price of 45 S$ per person you would expect much better quality. All three juices were not drinkable - just nauseatingly sweet. The dim sums were dried out and tasted like made of plastic. Mortadella didn't look very fresh so it would be best avoided. The live station served the worst…",3,
"We were blessed with a night's stay at MBS by a friend. As newlyweds, it was quite fun to be on our first staycation. Being one of Singapore's premier tourist spots, the price of the food available in the connected food court and stalls nearby were understandably princely (as was the hotel's restaurants and room service meals/snacks).  Despite it being a weekday, the hotel was buzzing with numerous tourists - the infinity pool and jacuzzi pools at level 57 were teeming with people, the breakfast buffet at Rise was similarly crowded and the lifts often took a significant wait to arrive. It was difficult to find a private space to rest and relax.  We've nothing to complain about the service as the staff were very friendly and did their best in spite of the crowd seen everywhere we…",4,
"Having stay in this hotel for a few times , I have no other words to describe this super iconic Singapore Hotel, which I may even categorize as an Attraction. - Super Stunning view  However, this hotel has to fail to live up to the Quality Service standard despite operating for a few years.  No doubt that it has a lot of rooms and definitely I wont be the only one being expecting to be attended, but the service it has provided seem likely to be a second class tier rather one of top quality. Prices is indeed TOP, but service is NOT . Clear indication is that I was not properly attended to when being check in and check out. Breakfast area was not properly indicated by receptionist upon check in, pool area is Great but Small for such a big hotel. Well, given the choice to stay…",4,
"If you plan to visit Singapore, spend at least one or two nights in Marina Bay Sands. It is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Sg and it will give you plenty of joy and allow you to fill a glimmer of hedonism. It is expensive, but it is worth every penny. Swimming pool at the top deserves special review.",5,
What an amazing hotel. The pool was sensational with impressive views. Couldn't get the kids out. They put on a sound and light show in the evening which is clearly visible from the pool and well worth sticking around for. Breakfast at Spago's was equally impressive and the service was impeccable. Highly recommend.,5,
This is my second time in this hotel. I was here before 2 years and I liked so much the location and the hotel itself. This was the reason to book the hotel fir second time this year on my way to Japan. It is a very expensive hotel but because the hotel and specially the roof swimming pool are amassing and decide to come again. Everything was fine on the beginning and me and my family we were very excited. Our problems starts on the checking desk. Firstly the lady explained  to us that out credit card which is with Barclays UK and it is platinum card was declaimed. We spoke 3 times with our bank and this is not true because we have more than enough money in our account. Then the lady asked us to prepay our hotel and we did. Then on the bar they told us that we cant order…,1,
"to the Thu T that reviewed above....there are possibly 1000 rooms, do you expect it to be quiet? what a silly review   now for mine i decided to stay here for my 30th birthday with my partner and myself, we had the king deluxe premier suite. the room was perfectly situated on the 41st floor facing over the mall and the water. the whole hotel was very unique and amazing. the infinity pool was also amazing with some of the best views of Singapore, despite being up so high you're swimming in pretty much straight up smog, but thats a given considering the size of the city. my only gripe, was in your room they tell you not to wear thongs (flip flops) around the hotel, singlets, and if your a female, not to wear shorts. now we are australian, on a trip in south east asia...what do you…",5,
"Visted marina bay sands   as part of a back packing holiday , was well worth flying from kula lumpa to singapore just to stay at this hotel , rooms are massive , fridge is expensive but what else do u expect, spent most of the time in the infinity pool to be honest. What an amazing view, defo recommend goimg jusy for the view. ",5,
The hotel has the most amazing view of Singapore from the roof top park. an icon of Singapore for sure. had a great room on the 49th floor during my last stay with a breathtaking view of the port. The breakfast room is always very very busy but the food is great. Rooms are big and elegant.,4,
"We wanted to end our Asia trip with a bang so decided to spend $560 a night at Marina Bay Sand before heading back home. I was utterly disappointment the moment I got into the driveway. 1) drive way outside hotel is always busy, the taxi meter jumps up and we have to pay more for our fare for just trying to drive into the entrance.  2) hotel lobby is always really crowded and busy, it's like an immigrant center rather than a 5 stars hotel with people and luggages everywhere. 3) it takes an hour to take in as there was always so many people. 4) the room is big however everything seems to be of poor quality, merely a 3 stars let alone 5 stars hotel and definitely not worth the money. The toilet stinks so so badly that I gag and want to throw up every time I walk into it. Just…",1,
"Great hotel, super friendly staff. We had premier room, was very spacious and comfortable.  The pool is amazing, never to forget experience. What a view! Water at the pool is little heated, so you don't freeze when you get in :-). Water could be little warmer in my opinion.  Great ""adults only area "" i think every hotel should think about that for people who wanna relax. What i found great about the pool is that the stuff will walk around and collect the towels on the chairs when someone goes away for to long, so in this way people always will find a place to sit. In many other places people would occupied the chairs and go away and not use them, so in Marina bay this is not the case :-)",5,
"My partner and I stayed over for 2 days on 9-11 March to celebrate my birthday as well as for our company function held at MBS convention centre.  As we were rushing off for our function on the day of our check-in, the team assisting us in checking in was very understanding and prompt in getting us ready. Special mention to the team who assisted us in our reservation and checking in process – Jeremy, Bryan, Cindy, Joseph and Christine.   Throughout the stay, our requests from room service and house-keeping were very prompt. They was even a hand-written card and champagne given to us upon knowing its my birthday. The stay was nothing short of amazing with all the little gestures that made it so personal and impressionable. What impressed us the most was the sincerity and warmth…",5,
"Everyone already knows why this hotel is a bucket list item. Yes, the rooftop infinity pool is one-of-a-kind. Yes, the resort offers great dining (Spago on the roof) and nightlife (Ce La Vi, also on the roof). It even offers shopping at the adjacent mall and entertainment at the underground casino!   These are all things one comes to expect from a giant mega resort. But what really blew me away was that the Marina Bay Sands managed to deliver surprisingly personalized service through it all. My husband and I were two guests out of probably thousands, and the hotel managed to make us feel like #1. When the hotel made a minor administrative error prior to our stay, they offered a complimentary private airport shuttle to make up for it. After a long 21-hour journey from New York,…",5,
"Spent 5 nights here in one of their Club Rooms with a sofa bed for our toddler. Rooms are amazingly spacious and airy which was great seeing as we have a very busy toddler. Seeing as we landed at 1am, we had to check in at the front desk where the lady who looked after us wasn't quite on the ball- last thing you need after a long flight and in need of a snooze. She said our room wasn't ready despite us having paid for the night ahead so we can check in. Room actually was ready to go but she still sent up 2 staff members- one to clear the minibar and one to set up the sofa bed- poor communication.  What made it for us was the beautiful staff at Club 55, where we were able to eat breakfast, have afternoon tea and canapés every day- it wasn't too busy up there and the staff were so…",5,
"The hotel complex is enormous (the equivalent of the Venitian on the strip in Las Vegas  - casino included!). The infinity pool is a must see simply because it's so unique. As it was my birthday we were upgraded to a suite on the 53rd floor with an incredible view of Singapore. Like in any Las Vegas-sized hotel, don't expect charm or sincere hospitality. It is after all a giant machine that has to be constantly turning. Nevertheless we had a great experience over all. (We even won some money in the casino!)",5,
"This hotel really is one of the best I've been to in the world.  It's definitely an experience not to be missed.  Quite apart from its' iconic architecture, superb location, amazing facilities and world-class food, from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were made to feel valued, special, welcome, and pampered.  The service really does elevate the guest experience from wow to absolutely unforgettable.  We booked a club room, and stayed for 3 days.  Right from the off, Jeremy in Guest Relations was in touch to ensure that we were happy and had everything we need.  When we asked if we could move rooms to change from a garden view to a city view, he couldn't have been more helpful and arranged everything straight away.  Our room was AMAZING, on 38th floor with…",5,
Everything you need is here. The room was very large and very clean. The bathroom had both a tub and stall shower. We were in a club room and had a full breakfast there. At four o'clock there was tea and at five o'clock there were drinks and appetizers. However the best was the infinity pool on the 57th floor that overlooked the city. At the pool there was an adult only section as well as drink and food service. We had dinner at Spago which was excellent. Also attached to the hotel was a large shopping mall and food court. The casino was in another building.,5,
"I was in the hotel with my family 2 days as my 11 year old son wants to experience the infinity pool. Since the moment you arrive to your room the experience is excellent, you open the doors and the curtains open automatically and in my case, Gardens by the bay appears! The room is big, very nice decorated, clean and with a little balcony that allows you to enjoy the magnificent view at any time of the day! The pool is an experience itself, the views you are going to be able to see from there are amazing, the bad part is that is always FULL! (be prepared to ""fight"" for a beach chair. If you are with kids avoid going to the pool at night hours as is full of people. Then in the hotel area you have a lot of things to do, and walking in the hotel mall is an experience itself.  Its…",5,
"It is expensive but worthy, I spent one night but it was good enough to have experience for the Roof Top Pool, Perfect ""Roof Top Pool, Service & Rooms"", but Pool need to be heated as it is very cold especially at night.",5,
"This was the 3rd league of my Asian trip with my 12 year old son. We had stayed in the Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur and the Shangri-La Rasa Sayang in Penang before we checked into the Marina Bay Sands. Gosh! We were met with an unpleasant surprise. In all our reservations we had reserved a room which would accommodate 2 adults and 1 child. In both the Grand Hyatt and Shangri-La we were assigned rooms with 1 king bed and 1 extra bed for my son. Shockingly, when we checked into the Marina Bay Sands we were offered a room with 2 twin beds. I guess they expected one of us to sleep on the floor. When I pointed out that I had reserved a room for 2 adults and 1 child, they merely shrugged and said they do not guarantee beds for everyone in the reservation. However, they did offer an extra…",1,
During my recent business trip I stayed there this hotel got its own class which was mesmerizing. I loved the rooms along with view of the city and you could see almost all city from its top it's a kind of one of the best maintained property I had ever visited the staff is intelligent polite as well as courteous. Check in was smooth and good is sumptuous the preparation is also mind blowing loved the taste and stay was very much comfortable It was like business cum leisure trip for me. Will gonna stay at the same place during my next stay very soon.,5,
"This is a splendid looking hotel with a wonderful swimming pool on the roof. The food here is great and they can cater for anybody however, my one concern is that if you have a later booking out time you still have to be out of your room by 12.00am you then  have to  hand your key-card in and then you are  unable to use the lift or the swimming pool area.  Therefore, you have a whole day in the hotel on the ground floor with nothing to do.  The rooms here are huge with enough room to have a party in.  If you like new technology and huge spaces this is the place for you.  Nice to stay for a night or two but I would not go back.",4,
"Do visit MBS if you want to be blown away by one of Singapore's best architectural designs.  You can enjoy various services they provide such as spa and message.   Sightseeing is free here and its one of the best things you can do, however if you plan on spending here, do remember to bring extra cash as things are definitely not cheap.",5,
"We stayed here for three nights on our way home from Bali. It is expensive but it's an amazing experience. The room was lovely, overlooking the bay. It was great being able to lay in bed and press a button to open the curtains to reveal the view, HOWEVER, I can't understand why the curtains only open a third of the width of the window. I thought they must be broken and reported it but the man who came to mend them said they only opened the middle third.  We had breakfast included and I couldn't fault it. The first two mornings we ate in Adrift, which was smaller than the main restaurant. The choice and standard was excellent, though I would have preferred a pot of tea rather than being poured a cup at a time. On the last morning we ate in the main restaurant as we had an early…",5,
We spent 2 night in this wonderful place; it's all you need while staying in Singapore. Perfect location; huge choice of food and for all budget. Shopping paradise.  The highlight of the hotel is the amazing view from the room.  Highly recommend this place while staying in Singapore,5,
"We (Family of 3 adults) stayed in a King Club Room with a view on the 47th floor and the views were breathtaking.  Room was a really good size with the roll-away bed for our Son who didn't complain about getting a good night sleep on the bed so it must have been comfy.  The pool, the observation decks, the Club Lounge, the most heartfelt and loving staff all were a winner for us.  We can't rate this hotel highly enough, we were a little apprehensive about the price I must say and other reviews either love or think it's just not worth the money.  For us it was a few days of 'lifestyle luxury' it wasn't just a 'hotel' you actually used the hotel for more than sleeping, it's about everything.  The room, food, views, pool, convenience of everything surrounding the hotel which is…",5,
From Jan 2017 to 12th Mar 2017 I was in Singapore.  I have seen most of the places in Singapore.  Marina Bay Sands is one of the best tourist spot in Singapore.  Tourist do not miss this high and beautiful building.,4,
 I really enjoyed my stay at Marina Bay Sands! No need to say about amazing view and good cocktails! The water in the pool is a little cold but fine. There is a Miracle Garden just next to the hotel. It looks amazing at night!,5,
"Magic, great architecture, new! Wonderful views to all sides: City skyline, park, dock, tens big ships floating on the outer sea. Great pool area on the top. Take a taxi: near the are Chester, Marina Pay Golf Course and the whole great City of Singapore.    ",5,
"The hotel room was huge and comfortable, with a nice view overlooking the shopping mall and the bay. The staff were super nice, even though the check in and out was very slow because the majority of hotel guests did it at the same time. The best thing of the hotel is the infinity pool, of course. We stayed there all day and all night long, till 11pm. We enjoyed both the pool overlooking the marina bay, and the hot tubs, overlooking the Gardens by the bay. The food at the pool was nice as well. We visited the casino one night, which was also amazing. We will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,
"Everything in Singapore works around MBS. Me and my girlfriend stayed 2 nights in this hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful and the hotel is beyond amazing, rooms are big and welcoming(but not 5* star rated in my opinion), with the infinity pool beying the top attration in there. Speaking about infinity pool i have to say that is surreal and defenetely worth to visit, but because the space is so overcrowded and desorganized it's hard to understand if people gone from their seats or they still there(this should be something that they need to try to improve). Breakfast very fresh and with a lot of variety, but a little too pricey even if we can say that quality exists. Defenetely worth to stay in this hotel as is the ""Eiffel Tower"" of Singapore but with some points that need…",4,
"Nice drinks n view but overcrowded both at the bar n the lounge area. Got to sit down n relaxed at the bar but did not do so at the lounge area. Had to stand up for a long time n even finding a spot to stand up was like looking for a table in a hawker centre. Quite disappointing, especially when tables with seats were ""saved and reserved"" for nobody till the end of the service.",4,
"We have to use a wheelchair accessible room, but the room was amazing. Spacious enough, beautiful view. Bathroom well equipped with shower and bathtub and all kind of amenities present. With, I find this very important after a long travel, complimentary bottles of water in the room.",5,
"Fantastic view, comfortable bed, lovely bath tub and shower. Housekeeping was also efficient and helpful as I didn't know how to adjust the temperature at 3am and the maintenance man appeared very quickly and was very courteous.   Being adjacent to Marina Bay shopping area  was great as shopping was convenient and I also took the opportunity to dine at Gordon Ramsey's Bread Kitchen there. I'd love to stay at MBS again.",5,
We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It was absolutely stunning. Our room was on 35th floor and the view from our room was amazing. Breakfast was very good and specially we loved the infinity pool @ rooftop.,5,
Beautiful and enormous hotel. Near to the airport. Excellent dine-in service and room service. Clean and spacious. Comfy beds. Nice bathroom. Respectful and friendly staff. Spectacular city view from the room and breathtaking sea view from the rooftop. Pool available on the rooftop. Restaurants and Cafes available on the ground floor. Entry to the shopping mall and metro via hotel. Luggage storage for post-stay. Very close to many attraction and shopping malls. FYI: Recommend taxi to get around and its cheap.,5,
"My family decided to check in at Marina Bay Sands last weekend for a 1 night stay. I had high expectations after watching the 8 episode documentary ""Marina Bay Sands 24/7"". We took a taxi to the hotel and the first thing the driver asked us when we told him to take us to Marina Bay Sand was ""which tower?"". Nothing in my booking email states as such. We got off at Tower 1 but a staff approached me while i was queueing and asked to see my reservation. Turns out our room, the Deluxe room is in Tower 3. We hauled our stuff to Tower 3 which is about 5 min walk to the other reception counter. Luckily, the counter was fully manned so we were able to check-in quite fast. From the get-go, the staff who attended to us was pleasant and attentive. When we got to the room, we were impressed…",4,
"Booking for only 1 night at this was great in some point. Hotel has a great view of the city, closer location to the great tourist spots!spacious room area and lovely staffs.   Some major comment i would really have was that there was no hand shower, i know mostly of international hotel should atleast have it. Difficult with us coming from Dubai as ever hotel does provided it with a bidet. Another one was the famous infinity pool. Dissapointed that its not temp control. Being located at the highest point of a building. The water at the pool was really freezin cold for us specially for a kid..We were able to enjoy to swim. as we can literally stay in the water at only 5-10 min to take pictures and back to our room.   But the hotel as overall was great and we hope of booking much…",4,
"We have been to Singapore many times and have always wanted to experience the hotel for the Pool.  This time we decided to lash out, so booked a club room.  The hotel is amazing, and we loved our two nights there, feeling very sorry having to leave.   The room was excellent, and we arrived at 6 am and were provided an early check-in which was fantastic.  The only downside was that, even though we ordered a club room, it was on level four, so it view was limited.   The room was spacious, with all the amenities expected of a top line hotel – except for the floor level, we could not have been happier.   We have a young child as well, and a crib was provided soon after arrival.  The hotel pool absolutely lives up to its reputation – we absolutely loved it.  The view is incredible,…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands .. the name in itself is enough as it must be one of the most sought after places in Singapore. Right from the iconic infinity pool to the casino, it is one place which makes to the bucket list of most of the people visiting Singapore. Stayed here for a couple of days and although I was impressed by most of the things yet there seemed to be a bit of gap in service to be vs service offered which is a rarity for a 5* property. The processes are tedious, right from check in to check out .. whether to check in from the main counter or to move to the other side .. there is always some soft of confusion going around. Early check ins aren't the thing here and thus a lot of peeps waiting in lobby could be seen. Also, I know it is a thing but the sheer number of selfie…",5,
"How can you not be taken away with the views from this hotel. From the moment you enter this hotel the sheer size hits you. The entrance lobby and checking in desk of which there are several is quick and the staff so welcoming. Sometimes I could see on busy days there might be a wait. Having got to the room and blown away by the view over the Singapore Marina, the size of the room and the bathroom. Then up to the swimming pool and that view. The infinity pool is wonderful, yes it does get busy up there but there again most people staying in the hotel will be visiting the pool. The staff who work constantly very hard always polite and helpful serving drinks and food. It is a wonderful place to relax. The breakfast at several locations around the hotel is excellent quality even if…",5,

"A first class hotel, great food outstanding service. The evening drinks in the bar were fantastic, with all sorts of nibbles large and small. We had a beautiful room almost at the top of the tower, it had amazing views with excellent facilities. The highlight of our stay was using the infinity pool, which you have to see and use to believe, just magical. It is a good hotel to access all ares of Singapore, using bus, train and taxi.",5,
"A one of a kind hotel, worth the money, with an incredible view of the city, the only other hotel we have stayed in with an even more impressive view is the Hyatt Regency in HK, where we stayed on the 109 floor overlooking the island.",5,
Worth a visit and trip to the top. A must to have a drink at the outside bar. Restaurant expensive but drinks on the deck okay. Amazing views to be had. Take lots of photos and  do the shopping centre. The Gondala riddle in the shopping mall isn't expensive to do. A must if your in Dingapore.  ,5,
"The hotel is great everything very clean, staff so friendly and helpful. The view from the infinite pool is amazing but the only thing that is not great there is the price they really over charge for drinks and food.",5,
"MBS defines what a truly integrated resort is. I can spend my whole 3D/2N vacation in MBS and never run out of things to do, without even leaving the property! The facilities are on top of the line. The structure is magnificent. The amenities are beyond expectations. The food outlets are of wide variety. The shoppes are high-end. The location is very convenient (If I get lost in the city, all I have to do is look up and I'll see MBS & I'll know how to get back to our hotel). And the view from the top and even from the room, are simply amazing!!! Regardless of the time, whether early in the morning, in the middle of the day, and even on night time, the view is breathtaking.  Must-try/Must-DO -Breakfast at Rise Restaurant -Steak and scallops at Bread Street Kitchen -Steak, Wild…",5,
"We checked-in last 8 March 2017 at the Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) Hotel and we were given a room at Tower 1. We unpacked our bags at around 4:00 p.m. and quickly left the Hotel to start our tour of the scenic spots of Singapore.   After enjoying the swimming facilities of the Infinity Pool in the morning of 9 March 2017, I wanted to approach the Front Office to raise a room-related concern. It is not in my nature to complain and I know how frustrating it can get when concerns are ignored or brushed aside. But then again, I had to do something because we really wanted my then upcoming birthday celebration in Singapore to be as seamless as it could be. We thus contacted the Front Office of the Hotel (near Rise Restaurant), albeit anxious and afraid of rejection, and conversed with a…",5,
"One of the best hotels in a metropolitan city. Rooftop pool is obviously a must!  Unfortunately, we visited in late September around the time that Indonesian smoke travels north and so the sky was full of smog during our entire stay. We didn't get the gorgeous views at all - nevertheless, the pool is amazing.",5,
"We stayed here while I was on an MBA trip with my university. It was such a nice hotel, and the rooftop pool has an amazing view of the city and the bay. The hotel also has a nice bar on the top floor. It's a great place to stay whether with family, friends, or solo. I also have to add, the breakfast spread is epic.",5,
"Had a great time here, the hotel is great, with fantastic views from the roof top floor, lovely infinity pool situated on the roof. Rooms very luxurious and service good. Cannot fault the place. Would certainly recommend to stay here.",5,
"Location was great! We got a high floor facing Gardens by the Bay and the view was awesome. We could even hear and watch the evening light show at 7.45 and 8.45pm from our room. We went up to the rooftop pool both in the day and at night - it was very breezy at night, a bit too cold for our liking.",5,
Very Very Very nice place for our 10 year wedding anniversary highly recommend it great breakfast included afternoon tea included evening drinks included. Great staff kept getting gifts from hotel staff for the occasion. Great variety of food I've never seen and the view from our room was amazing. Very well priced good value for money.,5,
"It was crowded ,as it is a big hotel .Nice vibes at night though .They have the most beautiful and insane view from Singapore and the pool at night is simply goal 😻Nice music on the rooftop at night .The hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars and shops .There is so many things to do here !",4,
Did not disappoint at all. Singapore sling service to the room is an unbelievable experience. The standard double bed room with a balcony is what we stayed in and it was a nice room but nothing too impressive from what you see in other luxury hotels. Every restaurant that we ate at in the hotel was absolutely incredible. Especially the pool bars/ restaurants on the top of the hotel just because the views are so stunning. We went up here every night that we were staying at the hotel.,5,
"Stayed at MBS with a group of friends. Loved the place, the views and of course the casino. Good accessibility to basically everything your heart desires, Michelin star  chef restaurants, hi street shopping and full on entertainment.  The infinity pool and the view is pure love. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again.  Just one small complaint though, for such a huge hotel the check in and check out process is too slow. Need to have more operators handling the rush.",5,
"The goods: The views, the pool, the bar at the top, having breakfast in the top deck, the service, the all integrated shops location. Room service is good. And the variety of restaurants in the complex is great!!  The bad: the room is very average. I mean a. It disappointing. But will go back because of the good location.  ",3,
"I stayed for two nights with my family and we enjoyed our time there. Considering this hotel has more than 2500 rooms, the service is pretty decent, something not expected in hotels with too many rooms. The hotel is expensive though, but what it makes it worth is the unique experience in the infinity pool at the 57th floor, which has a magnificent view of Singapore's main attractions.   The rooms are very comfortable and allows a good rest. Each room has huge windows and if you are in high-floors, you can enjoy amazing views of town. Our room was in the 39th floor, facing the bay, and we could watch from there the night shows with lights.  The only downside is that the hotel is very expensive.",4,
I really had a great time staying at Marina Bay Sands. My family and I will definitely return in Summer to have fun with my kids. I recommend this place to everyone who like to enjoy and make most of their vacation.,5,
"We stayed here in October 2014 but I forgot to review! Just amazing. So many options for food, all delicious. Comfy bed, amazing pool, friendly staff. Would love to go back!!! Had the best start to our honeymoon. ",5,
"Extremely glad to have chosen this hotel to stay at for my first ever visit to Singapore! From the moment I got out of the cab, I was warmly welcomed by a staff who politely introduced himself and took on my belongings for storage while I was checking in. My luggage arrived in my room shortly after I did which was fab as I was able to quickly sort out my things and prepare to explore the city. The checking-in process took quite some time but they served chilled drinks to those queueing.   Room-wise, I was impressed by the size and most importantly, the comfort of the bed and the cleanliness of the room. Spotless. Spot on. The room I got on the 18th floor had a balcony with the impressive view of Gardens by the Bay.   I also cannot commend enough the in-room dining service! Foods…",5,
"Guessed this is one of the best ratings hotel in Singapore. But of course the price would be higher to enjoy this wonderful experience, They have a coolest swimming pool at level 57 (exclusively only for in house guest), with an observation deck. Hotel is clean and spacious. you just gonna have a comfortable sleep throughout the night with the king size bed. If you are a budget person, you might not able to try it everytime you come singapore but at least for once you have to experience this. Book for a normal deluxe room its good enough to enjoy this hotel.",5,
This place has over 2300 rooms and in the downstairs lobby you feel like an ant but once we got out of the elevator we were made to feel like we were the hotel's most important guests.  Service was amazingly quick.  The fitness center is excellent and you are steps away from a nice choice of world class restaurants as well as a huge high end shopping center.  This was our second stay and will be the hotel we choose when once again in this great City.,5,
"Was lucky enough to stay at this iconic hotel for 1 night. Very expensive price tag but nonetheless, worth the splurge. Hotel grounds are impeccable and overwhelming in a good way. Room is super clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The infinity pool was the highlight as it is for most. Views are just spectacular. Would gladly stay here again if the price is right. I must commend the staff for locating my sweater that I left in the room closet after checking out.",5,
"stayed for 2 nights at this amazing hotel, it truly is breathtaking when you stand back and look at it. huge hotel with 3 towers. our room was floor 23, with the most wonderful views of hong kong. room was immaculately clean with the most comfortable bed. much needed aircon and posh bathroom. maid service was second to none.  the infinity pool is like nothing you will ever experience, the views from the edge of the pool are something else. we were lucky as had 2 days of 33 degrees sun - i know it can be hit and miss with singapore weather, very humid. drinks are extremely expensive on the roof bar, bit of a rip off.  breakfast was fantastic, expensive, but worth it, so make sure u are hungry is my bit of advice, kept us going the whole day! not within walking distance of…",5,
"Everything worked perfectly , since the check inn until check out! The architecture is breathtaking , staff works a lot with many kinds of cultures and are always super professionals, bedroom in front of the park in great? Rooms and bathrooms cleaned in the minimum details. Some points to comment : 1. Non smoking bedroom , but former client hide cigarets between the flowers on the balcony ,2, over crowded on sky restaurant, we were in the hotel and couldn't find any space or table for a drink.3 over crowded elevators too. 4. Swimming pool is great, impossible swim or just relax with one hundred people taking selfies at 6:30 am! I gave up! Anyway is astonishing .breakfast is good. The hotel is a masterpiece of architecture. Pictures later! Congrats for the hotel!",4,
Marina Bay Sands lived up to every aspect of its reputation for outstanding service and hospitality. We took the obligatory dip in the infinity pool on the roof and enjoyed the sensation of swimming in the sky very much. The swimming alone was worth every cent of the hotel bill We found the attached food court excellent in convenience and variety of cusine above par ,5,
"Huge building and beautiful scenery. Located not far away from garden by the bay, you can see nearby awesome attraction by walk such as the helix bridge, art science museum, the merlion, singapore flyer and theatre by the bay. Recommended to go there at night time around 7pm where all light and water show attraction begin usually started at 8pm. Of course it crowded but its worth so much. Free concert at theatre by the bay. All you need just some relaxation. Love it so much. Shopping.? Yeah you no worry it highly branded stuff everywhere. Bring along your camera and umbrella.",4,
"This is a grand property and it just amazes the guests with its size , location , architecture , styling , grandeur and experience . The scale is huge with its iconic & signature style and one gets dwarfed by its modernity and brilliance . The infinity pool is amazing and so is the shopping experience . One needs to experience the luxury offered by the hotel and its dedicated staff",5,
"What an amazing building and roof top bar will have to stay there next time I visit Singapore which is a great city with wonderful friendly people, everything is so immaculate and this building and service reflects this",5,
"Very best service, fantastic view  of the Marina Bay Gardens, stanning pool up the roof - everything as perfect as could imagine! The room was big enough and more for a couple. Definitely want to come back this hotel next time in Singapore :)",5,
We stayed here for a couple of nights on our way to Thailand. So so glad that we did! The pool is absolutely amazing and the drinks and food service pool side is top notch! Breakfast was delicious both days and we ate up on 57 as well as on the ground floor. Beds were comfy and our room service was great too!  Having a train station across the road and a full shopping centre is also great!  Definitely recommend staying here! ,5,
We had an amazing time at Marina bay sands.. the infinity pool is mind blowing with a very pretty view.. we preferred the city side view.. the place is expensive but totally apt for a occasional stay. ,5,
"Overall, the experience was good at Marina Bay Sands. The room was really nice and the view was pretty spectacular (we faced Gardens by the Bay). The hotel, on a whole, was quite a zoo though. There was a long line to check in, and the actual process of checking in took so long! Of course, we wanted to swim in the pool, which was even more hectic than the lobby. I soon realized that people set up camp on the loungers first thing in the morning and don't leave until the end of the day, I saw a couple of people napping under their towels, which I thought was a bit unnecessary and unfair to other people without chairs. I will say the service on the pool deck was quite impressive!   We only stayed for one night, and it was extremely windy and rainy, so were unable to fully use the…",4,
"Service at this hotel is great.  The location is perfect.  Amenities especially the infinity pool was massive and perfect.  This hotel is similar to Vegas hotels. So worth staying at this hotel.  I have a room that has a great view of the city.  During evenings, there is a city lights display and water display.  It's very nice.   The breakfast buffet was massive too.  Too many selection.   The best thing about this hotel is the service of the people working here.  They seem to be all happy and accommodating.  I'll be back soon at this hotel.",5,
We stayed in Tower 3 up on the 43rd floor which was nice and quiet and had a fantastic view of the Marina Bay Gardens which light up at night. Our room was spacious and comfortable but the view is the thing that makes it special. Guests have access to the infinity pool which is up on the 57th floor and looks over the city and has a buzzing bar. Expect masses of people at any one time taking selfies but it doesn't matter as it is so special to experience it.,5,
"This is a rather odd experience. Visually, the hotel is spectacular and in a fantastic setting. It is a casino hotel meaning that it is used for short stays and is designed to keep guests in the complex. It is expensive for what it is and, in particular, when tour parties are swapping over, the lifts are unacceptably busy. I had to wait 35 minutes at one point to get from the 28th floor to the ground floor.",3,
"Marina Bay Sands is one of the best architecture I've ever seen. When I was on the bottom part, I still couldn't believe that I was there. That was my first time to visit Singapore and it was awesome! If I was given a chance to take a look on the upper part of the hotel, that would be a dream come true dor me!!! Eventhough we we're just at the bottom of this beautiful creation it feels like, 'This is it! I am really here in Singapore!!! Whoaaaaah! I want to scream but that's kinda hilarious. Hahaha. We were actually arguing if whenever a colossal flood will come (In God's Grace, No Please!), does it will float? Hahaha. It could be. Haha. If I could have a chance to have an interview with the architect and engineer I would really ask everything! Hahaha. You can see the building…",5,
"Firstly let me just say that we had a really wonderful stay at the Marina Bay Sands and thought it was beautiful.   We are a young 20's couple at the end of a trip who decided to stay here, as you can imagine it's a well above our normal price range but couldn't resist that infinity pool.   The pool is only open to guests which is great and the view is absolutely spectacular.  The staff were all extremely helpful and kind and the hotel was extremely clean at all times.   The only two things I found lacking was  the rooms seemed a bit plain and dated compared to what I had expected and the food prices were just outright ridiculous.  Nevertheless the view from our room and the pool was nothing short of amazing. ",4,
the best of Singapore right there. In proximity the best of the night life in SG with a briliant view and atmosphere. We got upgraded to the 17th Floor and it was the most beautiful view of the entire place. Worth it.,5,
This is good 5 star hotel but the main addition is Infinity pool on 57th floor from where you can see the entire city. And ofcourse the casino in the hotel that makes the stay more expensive :)  The staff was courteous to provide us early check-in. The train is connected with the hotel basement so its easy to travel. They have great varieties of restaurant where you can enjoy different cuisines. The only thing that I found not so good - the hotel is always full of guest and visitors. you can never expect the lobby to be quiet.  Rest everything is good except the price you have to pay for the stay!! Highly recommended the swimming pool.,5,
"Had to go back to Marina Bay Sands. The location, just overwhelming and awesomeness of the hotel, were too much to pass up. Having said that the room needed a little bit of work. The carpet is aging, there is as no soap to wash your hands with, and there was a half a bottle of lotion That was left from previous guest. Spent over 700 US for two nights there and so so room, regardless, first visit to Singapore requires that you must stay at  Marina Bay Sands. The location and surrounding view were just incredible",4,
"A huge hotel with fantastic architecture and awesome infinity pool and view. The hotel was in connection with superb shopping mall , design museum and garden by the bay. Many choice in eatery: food courts and restaurants, bakery, supermarket.... The area was also very modern and beautiful.  The check in procedure special for clubroom hotel guest was very efficient and the room was ready although we were earlier than check in time. There was enough place in the room, also a small  balcony ! We could open the sliding door to the balcony, so that we did not use the aircondition the whole time and could stand outside enjoying the view. The bathroom was big with beautiful bathtube. The amenities were very good.  The furnishes may more modern and lighter . As clubroom guest , the…",5,
"One night only on a layover.  We upgraded to a Grand King with a balcony and views over the Gardens. we were on the 16th floor and i was expecting to be higher given the amount we paid for the room. I loved the way the curtains opened automatically when you put the room key in the power slot inside the door.  The room was very spacious but it was the bathroom that really stood out - enormous and with a full length window.  Unfortunately you had to have the blind down all of the time as otherwise people could see in (I checked),  Huge walk-in shower and separate standalone bath right in from of the window.  Exhibitionists paradise. The main reason we stayed was to use the rooftop infinity pool which is only available to hotel guests.  It is a knockout experience!  Who thought…",4,
The scale of the hotel was huge! Our room was clean and the views from the room were amazing. There were a lot of people at the infinity pool so we didn't get to stay too long but it was still very nice.,5,
"Stay here for 3 nights, first night was with city view then next night with garden view with balcony. We had bad experienced in front desk during our check in, we understand that the staff cannot find our request in our booking etc. but the thing was the staff attitude seems that he don't want to assist us which make us feel discrimanated. The tone of his voice was kinda rude and assertive, totally he didn't follow the hotel standard. Moreover, for the housekeeping service was good, concierge was very helpful and always happy to assist. Call center staff over the phone speak clearly and for the arrival experienced guest service offered to deliver our luggages in the room so we don't need to carry all during check in. The infinity pool is the main highlight of the hotel located…",3,
"Marina bay sands!   We obviously had an Amazing stay here. Almost Everything was perfect. They went out of their way to accommodate for all of our needs. The balcony view was fantastic, it overlooked supertree grove. Room service was amazing and the Pool is just out of this world. A couple minor things to keep in mind: 1) If you arrive early, you will be approached by a free lancing member of staff that will tell you to come back at 1PM as check in is not until 3PM. 2) It is annoying because you have to either come back later or go to concierge and plead with them to issue you a temporary key card to use the facilities such as the rooftop pool and gym. They shouldn't be so strict on this for guests as you don't stay at MBS for the rooms, it's all for the pool. Letting guests…",5,
"We stopped over in Singapore for one night and decided to spent it at this place with truly iconic architecture.  The view from the infinity poor doesn't disappoint, but the whole place at the sky park was absolutely overrun by tourists, taking selfies!  It's worth the money for ONE night.  I'd move to a Four Seasons after that, with a similar price point. The Pina Colada was yummy.     The room is clean, spacious and pleasant.  Bed is ok. Nothing special, but ok for a five star hotel. The view of the harbor and the park behind the hotel was quite nice.    The environment was beautiful.  We walked around the bay, the park, shopping centers, restaurants, cafes... all added up to a very relaxed day before heading over to Jakarta.  ",4,
"The rooftop bar is a must. Service is impeccable. Cocktails taste even better with this amazing view. One of the most beautiful places I have ever been. Beautiful people, excellent service, amazing view.",5,
We splurged and stayed here one night on our trip.  I don't know how but we got upgraded to a suite with our friends.  The amenities at Marina Bay Sands were top notch.  The view was amazing!  The pool- it felt amazing after 24+ hours of traveling. We took advantage of the gym- and there is nothing like running from 55 floors up looking out over the marina.  Drinking a coke from the very top while hanging out in the hot tub- words just can't describe.  To even look at the hotel from across the marina- was amazing.  I am so glad we splurged and stayed here.  Awesome to check this off our bucket list.,5,
"We stayed for two nights at the MBS hotel and had a fantastic time. Our experience didn't match the negative reviews I've read here. We turned up at 12 noon, KNOWING that check-in was from 3 pm so it wasn't a surprise when our room was not ready! However the very friendly check-in clerk gave us a pass so that we could access the roof area to have a drink and wait. At 2.15 we were given  our room key and went up to a fantastic view over the city.  The club rooms are a good size, very clean and it was a nice surprise to have a bath. We barely left the hotel for our two day visit and tried room service, in house dining and the level 55 dining ( for club and suite guests) The staff were, without exception, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant. The rooftop pool was a unique…",5,
"Iconic hotel of Singapour. It's worth the visit but only for one night, if you need calm, go somewhere else. It is so crowded the result is an impersonable service where you are treated as just a booking number.   The room was very comfortable. The rooftop infinity pool is spectacular, if you can battle your way through the masses of guests. The jacuzzis were always full of people. Unique view of the city and overlooking the Gardens By the Bay from the pool and from the observation deck.",4,
"This is definitely one of the best hotels that I've stayed at. Excellent rooms with excellent bathrooms. The infinity pool is just amazing up on the 57th floor with awesome views of the bay and city. Also a couple of jacuzzi's on the roof top too.  Great shopping centre next to the hotel and also access to the Singapore metro system for quick, easy access to anywhere in the city.  Will definitely be coming back to this hotel in the future. ",5,
"We were excited about this hotel and it was definitely our highlight trip in Singapore. At the reception we had very kind Mr. Antonio who gave us warm greeting, gave us room details and other tips and sightseeing in Singapore. The room was quite large and the best view I have ever seen!! The most exciting was the infinity pool and that was brilliant. We had many great photos for sunset and sunrise. Great experience.",5,
"We stayed at this Hotel because it was  a 2 night stop over at the end of a Mekong River Cruise. I have to say that we were a bit concerned that having a few grey hairs between us this might not be a choice we would have made. This is a huge Hotel and with a constant flow of people . This peaks around the normal checkout 11 am and the middle of the afternoon.  Check in -  A young man plucked us out of a long queue and took us to the concierge check in  were a young lady explained everything at full throttle. When asked to slow down she politely repeated it  . I suggest that you try and get breakfast included in the booking and be clear where you can take it, otherwise its over 100 Sing $ per couple. I would also consider a club room as there are no lounges here or places to sit…",4,
"Ive stayed in some great hotels around the world and this has to be right up one there as one of, if not the best  Ive ever stayed in. Cant say enough about the staff, they cant do enough for you and so friendly, even though it is a huge hotel with a lot of guests we were still always greeted by name. Spotlessly clean as is Singapore in general. Will definitely return here and wld recommend it to anyone. ",5,
Loved this hotel pool/restaurant/bar! The rooms are nice but nothing spectacular considering the price... but you have the mall downstairs and access to metro train station too. It's like it's own city. Amazing and convienient!,5,
Had one night and two days in Singapore and this is where I spent my time  The place is huge busy down in foyer and did think might be nightmare but once checked in which was super fast as got taken to faster check in Went straight up to the infinity pool was as amazing as I imagined We went for walk round shopping centre and gardens  Had dinner at Spargo👌👌 then back in the pool Gym was great also great view of the city skyline  I hope I get to go back and stay a few days  ,5,
"I thought I would treat my family to our first night in Singapore at the MBS. This place is enormous, and very busy. Check in was slow, but I can't complain because a room was ready for us well before the advertised checkin time, which we greatly appreciated because we had just come off a long flight. Because of its enormity, it is a little difficult to find your way around, but eventually we managed to navigate our way through.  The view from our 8th floor room was amazing, and faced the Gardens by the Bay. The room itself was of good proportion, but was nothing special for a 5 star property - I lifted the cushion on the chair next to one of the beds to see if that was the bed for my son, and a plume of dust wafted up, but otherwise, the room was fine.  I phoned reception to…",3,
"Everything is as good as before. Stayed 2 nights (03/02/2017-04/02/2017). Added attractions: Visited the Garden by the Bay at night, beautiful and lots to see. Had dinner  with my daughter,her husband and my three grand children at the Market by the Bay, we all love the foods, however can be pricey.",4,
"The sheer beauty of the hotel and rooftop lounge is a must see, with views of the bay and downtown, also the rooftop infinity pool.",5,
"This hotel is an icon. Very popular and often fully booked even though it is a big hotel with many rooms. It's a great experience: the view from the room and the pool on 57th floor was magnificent. If you look at the price and the service it is not the best value for money in Singapore. Being such a big hotel we felt quite anonymous. Queing up like at the airport for checking in and out. However, it's kind of a must do and location is perfect, close to metro and Gardens By The Bay. Walking distance from the waterfront. One night here is enough, though.",4,
"The expectations when staying on this property are always very high, but prepare to have a not very personal experience when staying here, don't get me wrong the property is amazing but it is so massive that sometimes you feel like you are not even staying at the place...reception staff, was very attentive and polite despite having dozens on people to check-in when I arrived and were kind enough to upgrade me to a top floor room! The rooms are modern and ample, very large bathroom , very-well stocked mini-bar and amazing views! The pool area was a little disappointing, as there are too many people for that space and it gets very crowded not to mention the water is very cold... Room-service was always very good!",4,
"This part of singapore simply has to be on anyone's agenda. Vast array of shops and things to see and do. Caters for both indoor and outdoor. Very safe for an evening stroll. The hotel itself is simply amazing. I paid $9 for an espresso at one of the coffee shops - so it's not cheap , but absolutely worth the experience.",5,
We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights in a $800 a night room on the 45th floor overlooking the city. Our whole stay was perfect with top class service and friendly staff.  Sure the infinity pool was crowded but we did not go to swim but to enjoy 5 star service. Excellent food for all our three daily repast and as much champagne as one could drink.  I really do not see how anyone can rate this hotel poorly. Perhaps if you try to go there on the cheap then you get a cheap experience! Just throw $800 at a room and you will have a brilliant experience.   Of particular note to we two for exceptional service were Wilson and Lawrence in Club 55  In comparison we went to Raffles for afternoon tea and it was a complete rip off. $145 for a few white sandwiches and a few average cakes. After…,5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a must do. Not only the rooftop pool, which is of course one of it's greatest attractions, but the whole package of an enormous shopping mall, great restaurants and good service, as well as an attractive surrounding makes it a great deal.",5,
"It's worth the visit but only for a night. It's so big it is like a city, alive with tourists and guests and a challenge for the hotel to differentiate between them. The result is quite an impersonable service where you are treated as just a number. Security is fierce and as a result guests have to experience the aggressive nature of the security guards checking if your eligibility matches the location you wish to visit. A tip - always carry both room keys with you. Failure to do so will inhibit access for both of you.  We have got the photos of the pool (if you can battle your way through the masses of guests) 1 night was enough, now for peace in a real 5 star hotel.",3,
"This was our last night at the end of a fantastic holiday to Maldives. We wanted to end it on a high. The hotel is huge and impressive but was extremely busy and felt it. People everywhere. Yes the infinity pool is a big Wow factor but again busy, and a little chilly for my liking!! Our room was a big Wow! Very large, comfortable and lots of buttons to play with! The view was fantastic, could sit there all day !  Breakfast was ok, lots of choice but strange how you could go to the buffet for bacon etc but had to order your eggs from your table which were brought to you when ready. Usually after you'd eaten your bacon?  Designer shopping mall below the hotel. Plus nice bars and restaurants to go to of an evening along the harbour to watch the fantastic light display from the…",4,
"I have had the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on my list of places to stay since I saw a documentary on its construction aboard a flight to KL about 5 years ago. The Hotels location, swimming in the infinity pool and relaxing with a glass of champagne created a picture etched in my mind to fulfil. The anticipated experience was just a fraction of the reality of our wonderful stay. My three adult children and I booked two twin rooms to create some magic memories in Singapore. After three days exploring Singapore including a day at the Sentosa's Adventure Cove Water Park and Aquarium, Chinatown, Clarke  Quay Restaurants, Marina Bay Laser Light Show across the Bay and Gardens By The Bay, the four of us realised my dream become a reality.  The staff at reception were so helpful, informative…",5,
The experience is the minute you walk in the room- it is a picture perfect view of the bay. Room comfortable and the pool on the roof a real treat. Great for a night cap- and just gazing into the night views around you.,5,
"Friendly staff and beautiful rooms. However, there are 2 major downers regarding this hotel: - most people (including me) visit this hotel to check out the world-famous Infinity Pool. For this very reason, be prepared to be disappointed: it is an overcrowded sausage factory, with people taking selfies all around you, and also a bit of a hygiene problem (we saw a nappie and a sanitary napkin floating) - don't expect to feel relaxed: it is a huge hotel, and there are people everywhere, queuing to check in and out, querrying, etc., with a loud echo in the massive lobby.",4,
" We checked out of MBS Hotel today and have the following to highlight to other tourists and visitors contemplating to stay there We have also written a formal complaint on the shocking service standards and attitudes of the staff  They spoil the reputation of this establishment and have absolutely no place in any service industry role.   1) Harassment by Housekeeping staff was intolerable, despite the Do Not Disturb indicator being turned on, the housekeeper on two occasions entered our room and intruded on our privacy on a previous stay On check out we were harassed every 30 mins by non-stop calls  A ring and some personal effects were missing from the bed/bedside table during our stay.  No replenishment of bathrobes were made despite robes being left on the bathtub in line…",1,
"We were really excited about our stay at Marina Bay Sands, specially because of it´s infinity pool. Well, the pool and the jacuzzi didn´t disappoint us, they really are amazing! But if you are looking for a 5 star hotel service, go somewhere else. Queues for everything in a very cold atmosphere. Ask for a room with a view of Gardens by the Bay. We had one and it´s pretty awesome!",3,
"We booked our stay at Marina Bay Sands the day we bought our tickets to Singapore in order to enjoy its amenities and celebrate our engagement. We had a king club room with (impressive) city view on the 40th floor. The club extras are worth while, with a comprehensive breakfast buffet, afternoon tea and early evening cocktails. Nothing to add as regards the lovely rooftop pool -which is of course crowded because every guest wants to enjoy it. The jacuzzis with a wonderful view over the gardens are also a plus. Because of our late flight on check out day, we appreciated the shower service very much.",5,
"As the title states, checking in to MBS was the highlight of our 2 night stay. This review is based on our experience at MBS.   - Checking In.  We arrived on my birthday and checked with the assistance of ""Marcus"". Marcus noticed on my passport that is was my birthday and as a result he wished me happy birthday and upgraded us to a suite and sent some chocolates to the room. Marcus's customer service was to be applauded.   - Room Service. With the expectation to be on par with our experience of MBS so far we were utterly disappointed. The food is comparable to public school cafeteria quality with the price tag of a designer handbag. We're talking Prada not Michael Kors. Some of the food was stale and or appeared to have been scraped off someone else's leftover plate. When we…",2,
"We spent our last night in Singapore at Marina Bay and it didn't disappoint. We booked a club room so it was very large and had a balcony overlooking Gardens by the Bay, which was incredible.  Afternoon tea, evening drinks and breakfast at the club were fantastic and we enjoyed every second of it. We didn't eat or drink anywhere else so we didn't have to experience the crowds some people are talking about.  Check in was easy and quick, there was no line to speak of and the man at reception was lovely and helpful. I would definitely recommend doing the express check out though, it literally took 2 minutes to fill the form in and drop it off. The infinity pool was incredible, worth every cent we paid. It was very busy at all times but it wasn't so crowded that you couldn't get a…",5,
Hotel checkin went very smoothly.  Allocated our room on 27th floor overlooking the bay with huge window to take in the view of singapore.  Beautiful amenities as you would expect but you are really paying the top dollar to experience the amazing rooftop infinity pool overlooking the city of Singapore.  Absolutely gorgeous and where we spent most of our time.  We also did the gondola trip through the shopping centre to where the fountain drains down from the rooftop - well worth a look!  Found a great cafe nearby where we had breakfast each morning.,5,
"We arrived mid day and were warmly greeted with staff.  The lobby was grand and absolutely busy.  I saw the line waiting to be check in... I thought, ""this is going to be a looooong process.""  But the line was moving along.  The hotel had numerous registration staff busily doing their thing!  I  was approached by a young lady, neatly dressed and with bright smiles.  She told me that she is available to assist me with checking in.  Oh okay... I said.  I was taken to another section of a lobby and was handed over to another you lady, neatly dressed and also had bright smiles.  My wife and I started to feel at ease despite the large and busy lobby.    The young Japanese girl, I forgot her name :(, apologized for the wait and began to check us in.  She was so cute and bubbly and we…",5,
"This hotel is just amazing, the location is great, the architecture is extraordinary, the lobby is crowded but great design and the rooms are spacious, very well decorated and the views are awesome, the pool is a must and the restaurants also, the shopping area is another attraction to this place",5,
"This is a must go place to visit. The building its amazing, the food wonderful, My only concern its the amount of visitors, making this wonderful place a busy one. How ever if I ever go back I will visit. The view of the gardens is a bless. ",4,
It is simply amazing place. We were there just for one night and it was really special. The room is very big and it has a breathtaking view over the downtown. The pool on the roof is something unforgettable. The staff of the hotel is very nice and warm.,5,
"I wanted to stay at MSB because I wanted to experience the rooftop - the view, the pool and the restaurants at the top of MSB did not disappoint.  However, once you taken in the views and swum in the pool - find another hotel.  MSB wants to be a luxury property, but it is not.  MSB is a large, crowded hotel.  The rooms are nice, but nothing special.  Other than the Wolfgang Puck restaurant on the upper deck, the restaurants  are average.  There are so many other nice (and very nice) hotels in Singapore, my recommendation would be to spend one day/night at MSB and then move on to another hotel.",3,
"Absolutely beautiful, it's hard to say what we liked the most. The ground floor provides direct access to a huge shopping center and to the casino. We had a Deluxe Room that was huge(especially for the Singaporean standards), modern and with a fab view over the Gardens of the Bay. The Infinity Pool itself is worth the trip to Singapore.",5,
"If you're in Singapore, you will never miss this hotel.  Hence, one should stay to really enjoy what Singapore has to offer.  Don't miss to dine in their restaurant.  The view is spectacular.  The whole family would enjoy.",5,
"The view is great and the skylark impressive the staff is very nice and tries it's very best. But! The rooms are maximum 4 star level. Nothing special except the before mentioned impressive view. Beds are ok, bathrooms also ok, the furniture is awful. The skylark and its infinity pool are really beautiful theoretically. It's totally overcrowded, they let too much people in. It takes a long time to go up because elevator capacity is not sufficient at all. All in all it is not worth the enormous money you pay for it. It's cheaper to buy a ticket for the roof top or have dinner in one of the restaurants on top of the building. Low value high prices especially for these badly equipped rooms.",3,
I stayed here for a day just to enjoy the infinity pool and its is really awesome. The world's largest pool on 57th floor. The view from the pool is awesome. Another best thing is the breakfast. If you are at Singapore I would recommend you to stay here for a day atleast.,5,
Had a great view from the room. Upgraded to free breakfast. Infinity pool looked awesome in the sunset. Would be a great fun for the kids in the pool. Laser show and the light show at the garden by the bay is not to be missed.,5,
"We had a two day stay at this hotel ,would have loved longer but a bit out of our price range .  Absolutely stunning , not really keen on big hotels but once you are out of the main reception it's fine , never had to wait for a lift too long etc.  Meals are a bit pricey ,we stayed Bed and Breakfast ,  but head over to China Town and have street food , fantastic. The views are magnificent that we never closed the curtains .  The roof top pool is breathtaking , ok it gets busy but no wonder .  This was a once in a lifetime visit but worth every dollar !",5,
"This  hotel could be described as a tourist spot and a mega shopping mall on a vast scale. I stayed as I had heard all about the amazing infinity pool 52 storeys high and the incredible views. These did not disappoint. My bedroom was on the 42nd floor, Tower Three, facing the ""Gardens by The Bay"". I could not take enough photos, including the long lines of shipping awaiting dock entry, the night time views and the night scenes. I also wanted to visit the amazing Gardens by the Bay over the freeway; you can access from the hotel via a bridge you can reach from a ""hidden"" lift. I say hidden as the signage is terrible and it took me 30 minutes to find via a somewhat round-about route having been misdirected by the staff! They don't speak english.  The real problem is that reception…",3,
"The service at the hotel was very good overall, all the staff were very friendly and helpful. You can check in either at Tower 1 or 3 lobby. My room was very nice although not as luxurious as I expected but the views were spectacular as we were on a high floor with a balcony, with a view of the sea and Gardens by the Bay. Bathroom was spacious and toiletries were very good (loved their scent). The only bad experience during my stay: my arm was bitten by some insect during my first night in bed, which left red welts that itched for days - not a mosquito or scabbies.",5,
"We spent two nights at the Marina Bay Sands in two different rooms. Our first room was big, with a massive bathroom. Our second room, which included a balcony, was much smaller. But both rooms had spectacular views!  The rooftop infinity view is a must-see (you can only access the pool if you have a hotel room key). It's extremely crowded throughout all hours of the day but a great experience nonetheless. I highly recommend going at night!  The hotel is in a very central location. It is connected to the MTR, casino, mall, and pedestrian bridges to the Gardens By the Bay.   Service was excellent  (although I did encounter one extremely rude staff member working at the rewards counter)",5,
My room on the 41st floor had great views of the marina. The highlight of the hotel is the infinity pool on the top floor so do take your swim wear. If you like luxury watches and designer clothes you can find all the top brands at the Shoppes. Even if you don't gamble this is a great place to stay.,5,
Was recommended by a friend who travels to Singapore quite often. To get to the top floor you have to pay $20 per person but this is redeemable against drinks at the rooftop bar. Great view and the drinks were pretty good to. Staff could do better though. ,5,
"While we were here in Singapore we wanted to go up to the observation deck to take in the panoramic views of the city. It is a very impressively designed building and well worth a look around. There is a charge for going up to the observation deck as there always is for this sort of attraction and it is not cheap. The lift is very quick to take you up to the top and the decked area is very large so you won't feel crowded even if it is busy. The views are brilliant both of the city and of the harbour but, you don't have access to the infinity pool and also to the bar so bear that in mind before you go up.",4,
"Stopped over at Marina Bay Sands for one night only as it's a bit too crowded for my taste. We were on that side of the world so we needed to see the pool and the amazing architecture of this building. The gardens by the bay and the pool are not to be missed. Otherwise, the hotel suite, breakfast and service was good nothing amazing. A bit too ""vegas"" and city within a building. Very busy and loud...however I would say to go and mark it off your bucket list :) ",4,
We booked our last nights here. We wanted to be able to swim in the infinity pool with amazing views of the city. Our room was beautiful....beyond words....the view out of our room spectacular. They do a laser show at night which we could see from our room window when it was on. The checkin process and check out was painless. The only complaint we have was when we were ready to leave we had to call three times for someone to help us with our bags and no one ever came. We finally saw someone from housekeeping Wing Bang and she was so helpful. She actually helped us down with our bags herself. She was amazing but not impressed with the hotel staff that failed to help us from the right department within the hotel. Only reason for the lower rating. We were not impressed.,3,
"This was our first time and we were far from disappointed. We loved how convenient its location was, the hotel was close to many places to see in Singapore. Our stay was very comfortable and the hotel staff were very helpful and professional. We stayed in a club room and the housekeeper was very consistent; we loved her towel folding art, (it's unfortunate that I don't remember her name). We'd also like to commend the staff at Club55, in particularly the Filipinos who were very warm. The infinity pool was a highlight although later in the day it got rather crowded, it's best to swim in the morning. The hotel is pricey but well worth it.",5,
"Stayed in a high floor room with nice view. Rooftop Infinity pool is super selfie worthy. Very convenient base to explore the city. Plenty of dining options, both high end, medium range and food court. Also you can walk to gluttons bay for local food in outdoors setting. The best thing is really the location. ",5,
"I can't say anything bad about this place. Absolutely loved our stay here!  Great view no matter which side your room is on, with everything within walking distance. The pool cannot be beat - you must stay for at least one night if you are headed to Singapore - you won't be disappointed!",5,
This is an absolutely wonderful hotel.  You need to stay a few days just to see it all. The rooftop bars and infinity pool are just beautiful. Our room was magnificent with spectacular views. We didn't have time to dine there but the choice of restaurants was incredible ,5,
We stayed here in a suite for one night on our way home from Thailand and glad we did...Sinhapore is an incredible place and the hotel was great...suite was huge amd clean and the service was pretty good too...sky park and pool are amazing and a must do! Not the best hotel I've stayed in and not perfect but a great experience all the same...it's so big people were having guided tours around the hotel...the gardens opposite absolutely blew me away with the 8pm light show...a unique and unforgettable experience,5,
"I think the hotel is overpriced for what they offer . The infinity pool was over crowded each time we went , no matter what time of the day it is full of people . The view from the pool was amazing though but you pay for that view to stay in that hotel. You are not able to bring your guests with you to the pool. Entry only by the number of room keys you are given. Will not go back next time. Location was great though.",4,
"The Marina Bay Sands is the iconic big city hotel. The complex has the hotel, theatres, casino, restaurants, food centre and a three level shopping mall. It is pricey but our room was beautiful and large with a view of the commercial centre second to none. Of course it has the infinity pool, night club, restaurant and viewing deck at the top in a boat shaped building astride the three towers. The pool is cold, and I mean cold even by New Zealand standards and could use some better shade (I got sunburned a bit but it was my fault) but has a fantastic view. The whole complex is a city within a city. The shopping mall is nearly exclusively designer stores not much use for us non billionaires. The only downside is that the hotel is so huge that it takes some time to get anywhere…",5,
"This trip and staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was one of the Highlights on our Wish List, therefore we decided to book a few nights at the MBS and at the same time we  booked also tickets for the Musical Chicago at the Hotels Theatre.  We checked in at Tower 1 and during or check-in time the Hotel lobby was very busy however the front office was very well organized and after waiting only a few minutes we received a very friendly and efficient welcome.  We received a very beautiful room with a small balcony overlooking the sea and Gardens by the Bay. Of course the Highlights of this Fantastic Hotel are the facilities such as the amazing infinity pool and the sky park, we also enjoyed our cocktails at the CE LA Vi flight bar which came with a fantastic views of Singapore! …",5,
"We stayed two nights at this hotel to try out the infinity pool. We had a room in Tower 2 ( Middle one) at 47th floor with a city view (approx 650 SGD per night). This room type gives you access to club55 at 55th floor where breakfast, afternoon tea and aperitif are served. Quite a big range of different alcohols all free of charge, at least with our room rate. The second day we went to 57th floor for breakfast and we were disappointed that they would not serve fresh juices unless specifically ordered I believe ( it comes by standard in club55). All guests have access to the pool area, everyone must carry a room key to open an automatic door to the pool area, they don't tell you that at check in though. The pool has an amazing view and that's about it. It is very windy up there…",4,
"This hotel has everything you can dream of. It's a mall, a club, a parque, a gastronomic center, a night club, cassino and so much more. The only letdown is the shower. For a hotel like this one I would expect a dream shower with lots of water and that is not the case. Also the toilet facilities at the swimming pool area could be better. The internet is ok but keeps on disconnecting. Everything else fantastic!!! ",4,
"This is a huge resort with a 2561 room hotel, an immense convention- exhibition centre, its own shopping mall, a museum & 2 large theatres. If that is not enough to keep you looking for hours you can dine a restaurants run by celebrity chefs, look at the 2 floating Crystal Pavilions and break a leg on the skating rink. You can then donate your money to the world's largest atrium casino with 500 tables and 1,600 slot machines. The complex is topped by a 340-metre-long SkyPark with a capacity of 3,900 people and a 150 m infinity swimming pool, set on top of the world's largest public cantilevered platform, which overhangs the north tower by 67 m.Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story hotel towers which were topped out in July 2009. The three towers are connected by a 1 hectare roof…",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is an excellent Iconic hotel in Singapore. It stands out in the Singapore skyline. It is the place to stay in Singapore. If you did not stay at the Sands, then you will always wish you did. It is however, expensive, but worth it.",5,
"The hotel has 3 towers with an incredible Sky Park on the 57th floor which connects all 3 towers as well as retail and gaming on the lower level.  My room was in tower 1 deluxe  room category and it was spacious with a good sized bathroom and a soaking tub.  Sky Park located on 57th floor has a huge infinity pool and 360 degree views of Singapore  The complex also has a theatre and museum and to our surprise a decent size food court with a good selection of food if you don't want to dine in the hotel restaurants tip check out what shows are on and book in advance.  We enjoy our breakfast at the all day dining restaurant located in the lobby substantial selection of options for breakfast with western, Indian, Japanese and Chinese selections...need some improvement with the brewed…",5,
"Definitely not a 5-star standard for room and services. We stayed in the standard twin room. The balcony was dirty and there is no chair nor table. What's the point of the big balcony if we can't do anything. The amenities in the bathroom definitely do not cut for a 5 star property. Cheap Chinese shampoo and stuff. The directions are also confusing, especially the elevators. Although our receptionist was courteous and put us on a higher floor, there is no one explaining what facilities they have for guests. The infinity pool was of course breathtaking and quite an experience. That's probably the only thing that makes guests forget about all the other things that should make up for a 5-star property. Value wise: nope. It's just an expensive admission to the pool.",3,
"There are many very nice hotels in Singapore but this one  differentiates itself with iconic views of the the city and the Gardens by the Bay.  Sunset in the infinity pool is simply spectacular. The Club floor was worth the extra, with very attentive staff and a good selection of food and drinks (but it can get a bit busy and noisy at times). Hopefully our experience at check in was abnormal as it was exceedingly slow - otherwise definitely worth a visit.",4,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night following a holiday in Australia.  Last year I was lucky enough to stay at the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi.  Whilst staying there I was made aware that it was the second most expensive hotel in the world.  Being the person that I am, I instantly wanted to know what the most expensive was, and so the dream of visiting the Marina Bay Sands was borne.  Firstly, the Emirates Palace is a World class 7 star hotel, the Marina Bay Sands is unfortunately not.  Upon arrival we had to join a queue for 25 minutes to check in, then were told that our room would not be ready until much later.  (we did arrive at 8am and check in time is 3pm so I do understand).  We were told that we could use the pool area, and they would email us when the…",3,
The rooms have breathtaking views and of course the infinity pool. We booked it together with the 59 Lounge. This we had a light dinner included. The rooms are spacious and also the parking is very friendly.,5,
"This is a great hotel, its worth staying just so you can use the pool on level 57. The hotel itself is massive, its almost got a Vegas hotel feel about it. Huge! We stayed in one of the suites which was gorgeous with amazing views across the city. The dinner buffet is incredible and worth the money but make sure you go hungry! We were there early January so the hotel was packed but I get the feeling it would be busy all year round. There are some amazing hotels in Singapore so plenty of options but you need to try this, even just once!",5,
Once you are in Singapore this spot is a must to visit - Marina Bay - Sands roof top! We went there to watch sun set and it was magical moment!!! Singapore is amazing and seeing it from 57th floor at sun set - there is no more you could ask for! Amazing experience!!!,5,
"The experience is so unique that no other place can provide this at the moment. Level 57 is breathtaking and tho the place looked a bit crowded every part of the day, we could always get sunbeds in the row we wanted to, a good place for two in the hot tubs and enough time at the best picture spots. The hotel is in Pole position to everything and I risk to state that all rooms have excellent views. The only thing I missed that the water temperature could be warmer but I am from Hungary the land of thermal spas so it might be just me. :)",5,
"Best place to do your shopping. I suggest you get a Sands Rewards card first. Look at the tier levels, do your most expensive purchase first to get points and then maybe you can get a smaller item or free dinner at other stores/restaurants for free using your points!  Lots of things to do here. The pool was anticlimactic really. Looks great in pictures but you cant even really enjoy it as the temperature is cold, and then everyone is in the way just taking pictures. View is undeniably amazing however. Staff is super friendly. Very expensive food at the rooftop.",5,
"Spent a night at Marina Bay Sands in celebration of my 8 year anniversary with my boyfriend. The experience was faultless from check-in to check-out. We paid for the Club package which was well worth the extra money. Plenty of choice for food and beverages and great views up in the lounge area. The hotel itself was incredible, specifically the infinity pool. All staff were extremely helpful and could not do enough for us. In particular the Guest Experience Team and Duty Manager Bryan Cheong went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. I would definitely recommend Marina Bay Sands to anyone travelling to Singapore! ",5,
"Went to Singapore 4 times and I always stay in this incredible hotel because there is the infinity pool on the top floor. It's really convenient to walk around Marina Bay and to see the most popular landmark, Merlion. Absolutely will stay there when I go to Singapore even it's quite expensive but it's worth to pay for it.",5,
"My second stay - they kindly noted my first stay and gave me a different view/ floor, and late check out.  The pool bar menu has changed, but still good service.  My husband and I very much enjoyed the view of the gardens, having had the city view prior. Easier access to the gardens would be great! :)  The great shopping centre attached is a huge advantage. The porters and taxi attendants are fantastic. Check in is 3pm but this seems very flexi :)",5,
"We spent only one night but it was worth it. Took a city view room at 26th floor. No need to go higher. You can see super good from this hight and also watch the water show. We were with kids: 9 & 12.  One thing to keep in mind.Although they accommodate 2 adults and 2 kids in one room, you still need to pay extra for a 12 year old to get access to roof pool. 100 bucks on so. Most expensive pool ticket I have so far bought to my son ;-)  Another point. Although the weather is hot, the pool was surprisingly not that warm. At least not for a 7-8pm soaking. Most likely the winds at this hight cool the water down. Or we just expected even warmer :-)  ",5,
One of the priciest hotel in Singapore but also worth it because it has the best view in Singapore from the 57th floor Marina Bay Park that holds the best infinity pool in the world (for me) I only stayed there for the day but got the chance to try their gym and it was big with more equipments than I've ever seen in a hotel gym. It also has the view of the city below as you're running on the treadmill. They also have a hot pool and a sauna in each locker room 💜 If you are a shopper no need to worry because the hotel is connected to Marina Bay Shoppes which has all the high-end retail stores you can think of and if you're a foodie they have both the hotel's and the shoppe's food court to choose from which offers a variety of food for different taste palette 👍🏻 only if it was…,5,
"Check in was fast and friendly, room was as good and big as expected of a five star hotel. Amenities was really good, the tee was wonderful and shampoo smelled nice! Really clean room but a bit late and slow house cleaning. The extra bed was big and the baby coot too. The view was as expected a real treat and so was the infinity pool. One of the cleanest pools I have ever seen. If you like a good view this is the hotel for you! It's worth it!",5,
"Stay only a night, husband like to swim in the famous pool. Great view! We were so lucky that check into our room at 10.30am. Had problem with wifi, staff were more then happy to help, very efficient, friendly and helpful. Room were clean, bath room were big, mini bar full, full,. Great view of Garden By The Bay, city and harbour..Hotel is connected to a shopping centre, lots of foods outlets, museum. Our flight were late at night, they  looked after our laggauges, even shower at pool level,  conplamentory 1 hour late check out at 12pm. Was enjoyable stay for us.",5,
"One night here is all you need but it's definitely bucket list worthy. We treated ourselves to a one night stopover on our way to Vietnam and the views are breathtaking. It's a huge hotel, connected to a huge shopping mall and you can learn everything you need to know from reviews here. You're paying for the infinity pool which is an engineering marvel and like nothing you've ever seen before. It's crowded and the selfie sticks are everywhere but worth getting up to watch the sunrise - city in one direction, gardens and the ocean in the other.   Everything is expensive in Singapore and we found the prices at Marina Bay Sands to be similar to anywhere else - $42 for two beers at the bar next to the infinity pool but it's all part of the experience and you only do it once!   If…",5,
"We have decided to spend one night in this amazing hotel. The cost is high for a room that is not really amazing and the price doesn't even include breakfast :-0  Obviously we have been lucky as the pool was not crowded and this is for sure an incredible experience. My global feeling is that it a a nice hotel attracting a lot of people but not a luxury one. Staff is nice but not amazing (30 minutes to check in without understanding why it takes so much time, 45 min to get a cocktail at the pool).",3,
"the rooms are superb especaly over looking the gardens they have a great light light show every night. hotel well positioned for underground and river ferry trips, very high end shops in and around the hotel",5,
"Got these rooms at a good deal and they came with awesome view. 1 was facing esplanade while the other, gardens by the bay. Was glad with the rooms except the fact that getting up to the pool was super duper troublesome! the card was faulty twice and kept having to go to the reception to get it fixed",5,
"For my first trip to Singapore in many years I figured I had to stay here. It's in a great location for the gardens and bay area and of course there's the somewhat legendary pool.  We had a bit of a challenge when we checked in with our bags going missing (not great fun when you check in at 23:00 with a 3 years after a long flight and all you want is to have a shower, get changed and relax but all your clothes are somewhere else in the hotel!) but the staff were good and when they eventually arrived we settled down in our Orchard Suite. Views over the gardens and out to sea - very pleasant and lots of room to stretch out in.  The breakfast in Club55 was great with lots of options and the staff were absolutely amazing - friendly as can be and very accommodating of our crazy…",4,
"When staying at Marina bay sands you will have access to skywalk, outdoor swimming pool, best restaurants, casino and biggest shopping arcade. Rooms have stunning views over the gardens and bay and overall service is excellent",5,
"We stayed here so we could swim in the pool and it was worth the experience. Warning - the water is freezing (at least for this Miami girl), so I didn't stay in long. The only way to get in this pool is to stay at the hotel, otherwise, visitors can go up to the SkyPark or dine in nearby restaurants. Spago is adjacent to the pool and has good views, so if you don't care about getting in the water, that's a good way to go.  The hotel is pricey and we followed the recommendations of other reviewers and went with the Club level rooms, which are spacious and on the higher floors.  The views are great and access to Club 55 is terrific.   For breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails they offer an ample spread and a good pour for cocktails. Service is wonderful.  As for the hotel, its big…",4,
"My family and I stayed for a night in a family room. The room was fabulous. All I could have asked for in a 5 star hotel. The access to the infinity pool was quite strict, each person needs to have a card.",5,
"We came to visit Singapore for the first time with a few other couples.  When we checked into Marine Bay Sands, the entrance is overwhelming.  The architecture is astounding with the 3 Towers.  We checked into the Orchid Honeymoon suite and it was one of the most spacious suites ever.  The view of the Marine Bay from the 51st floor was breathtaking.   The service was top-notch with every employee going out of their way to help you.  We spent a day at the exquisite Infinity pool and the waiters addressed us by our first names at all times.  Impeccable service!  The Garden with Supertrees is absolutely amazing!!! Strongly recommend this Hotel and we will be back!!!",5,
"Lovely Hotel, was Ideal for a stop off on our way to Sydney Australia, very clean Hotel with polite and friendly staff, Excellent views over the bay and Stunning roof top swimming pool. Restaurants and Bars and room service were excellent, nothing was to much trouble for the staff they helped us make the most out of our short stay there helping us to arrange tours to see the high lights of the city.",5,
In November we visited Marina Bay Sands with my family and what a wonderful experience. The hotel is truly amazing. Very clean amazing staff and service. The view from the infinity pool it is mesmerising  If you are visiting Singapore definitely visit the hotel if not staying in there go and see the lobby. It is an amazing hotel great experience. Definitely worth the money. ,5,
"Hotel is amazing, people are friendly, definitely something to tick off the bucket list.  In saying that I would probably not pay that amount of money to stay there again.  Hotel is huge, seems more like an attraction then a hotel (a lot of people, very busy). Don't believe this hotel has enough staff to keep up with the foot traffic. The pool is amazing but was jammed packed at most times making it unenjoyable but views are beyond this world. If you don't mind crowds do it, if not then pay a little less at another 5star hotel down the road :) ",3,
"I stayed at MBS with my husband for our wedding anniversary. I have to say the experience was great - they welcomed us at the taxi stand so we don't have to wait in line they chose a room with a gratest view (On one site City view  and on the other side Gardens by the bay) for us also they surprise us with delicious cake. Food was delicious with a variety of salmons (I'm big amateur) and great meat - my husband. They also offer us express check out so we don't have to wait in the line. All the restaurants, cafes MBS were delightful it was really great experience! And the view from infinity pool was indeed breathtaking.  My big thx to Joseph Lim and Veronica Lim.",5,
"If you're staying here it's likely to be for the pool and it won't disappoint! We stayed in a city view room which had a great view as well as being large and modern. The disappointment with the hotel is that despite the high price you don't get anything else for your money. No free drinks, breakfast or other offers. In fact even getting on the Wifi requires subscribing to their rewards card. It's nice as a one off for the pool but there's not much service to go back for. ",4,
"Easy check in, great room, great view, great pool, easy links to the mall and conference centre. Breakfast is great, big choice for food and drink make this an ideal destination for both work or pleasure.",4,
"The restaurant is on the top of 3 tower blocks and looks like the top deck of a cruise liner. The infinity pool area is reserved for hotel guests but you can book the restaurant and use the open air bar and then if the mood takes you get in free to the disco!  The food was amazing and the service excellent. Expensive but well worth it. The dining experience is based on sharing dishes which means you can try lots of different things.  You can eat outside but we ate inside, still had a fabulous view.",5,
"everything is top notch here. although you can of course find similar standards at a lower price in singapore, you can't beat that location. i prefer the garden view over the city view because it is more relaxed.  unfortunately the weather wasn't great when we stayed here so we couldn't take full advantage of the pool, but we can't blame the hotel for that.",5,
First when you reach the hotel you will feel the size of hotel very large and gigantic as you approach one of the 3 towers of this hotel. A very nice 5 star property with a rooftop infinity pool is a diamond of this hotel. Rooms are large and both side rooms will give city skyline or the guardens by the bay view on other side.  As usual in 5 star above here also bath and shower are separate in room.  Breakfast spread is very good and also there is a restaurant and bar at top level of 57 th floor of the hotel which gives great views of Singapore.,5,
It so nice for holidays. For family and friends it's really great go to enjoy . It is nice and the bestest place ever I think. It's a suggestion to all just get a trial and enjoy it's damn sure.Thanks,5,
"The first thing to understand is that this is a mega hotel which holds 2500 rooms with nearly 4000 guests and is full 95%+ of the year. So while the amenities (including the roof top pool) are first class and the rooms excellent, you will be sharing this unique experience with literally thousands of other people on any given day. This can be a bit grating in terms of service standards (e.g. when checking in or when your room card doesn't work) especially when you are spending up to $1000 a night. That said, the Club facilities were excellent; extremely attentive to dietary needs and made something fresh for me that was celiac friendly every time we went there.  We would definitely recommend this to others but be aware of what you are going to - a high end hotel that services…",4,
"my best friend lives in Singapore and she knew someone that worked at this place and called them, I was so lucky enough to have someone to booked me a place here in the most busy night ever doing NYE ...if ever a chance to stay at this place do and experience the other half of life.",5,
"We spend my birthday at MBS. In Singapore I think is a MUST to try, but for only one time. Room are hold decorate but very big for Singapore standard. The colour that they choose for the carpets and moquette is not pleasant and doesn't allow you to relax. The infinity pool is out of control. Unfortunately always full of people without respect and overcrowded every time. One good thing is that you can swim also night time. We ordered room service and I have to to say was good. 3 starts because is not worthy the money, Singapore have better choices price quality. ",3,
Its a must to visit this place if you are in SG..... Make sure you check for the offersdiscount before shopping and visiting the Marina \bay Sands hotel....,5,
"Located in the bay this hotel has to be seen to be believed. Clearly visible from the plane as you approach Singapore. going the whole hog we were picked up in the hotels S Class limo (met off the plane and escorted through the airport) and whisked to the hotel. Staying in a grand club room we were checked in from our room and therefore did not have to queue at all. Also being in a club room it gives you access to club 55 where the most amazing breakfast is served each day to what seems an unending variety of food and also between 5 & 7 pm club guests are invited to free unlimited food and drinks. This is important as alcohol prices throughout Singapore are eye wateringly expensive, you can expect to pay around £8 yes £8 for a small beer, so the upgrade to a club room is worth…",5,
"This unique luxury hotel is expensive but special as it is in a great location with the Gardens by the Bay right behind it, the Flower Dome and other Dome plus adjacent to a Metro stop. The roof top infinity pool on the 57th floor is great although be prepared for crowds unless you go early. There is an adults only section which is nice to avoid the young kids. The restaurants are excellent although expensive. Rooms are very clean, large and offer great views from all sides. The Sweet Shoppe offers very good pastries and cappuccinos in the morning at a reasonable price.",5,
"Stayed here as a couple for two nights in February 2017 while visiting Singapore ( 3 stops - Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Bali).  Not sure how much this hotel cost us as it was part of are overall package. I wanted to stay here basically because of the pool if i'm honest. It didn't disappoint.  Transfer time from Airport is about 20min by taxi or transfer company. We have been using Buffalo tours throughout our trip and they have been excellent.  Check in is a bit mad. there are two check in areas in the lobby at tower 1 and 3. Tower 1 seemed to be busier. Anyway we had to queue for about 30min to check in. This wasn't a problem as you are provided with refreshments in the form of ice cream and juice.    The hotel itself is massive. Lifts can be busy in the morning however they…",5,
"I and my wife stayed at Marina Bay Sand for 1 night. It is a good hotel with excellent view in Singapore.  I think it is worth to experience staying at least once.  Because average hotel price in Singapore is very high (100-500 USD/night), Marina Bay Sand is not so much too expensive at 300-400 USD/night for my stay for Premier Room.  Good things about this hotel: - Good view from room - Fitness with full equipment - Infinity Pool - Free Wifi in all buildings including in room - Near Shopping Center - Hotel staff is friendly  Some inconvenient for us about this hotel: - No bathtub for Premier/Deluxe room - Minibar fridge is auto-charge if take the can out, so i cannot put my beverage to the fridge - No Shaver in Amenity set - From Airport to Hotel by MRT has many exchange…",4,
"It is worth staying in this hotel at least one time, for a day, or better two, just for the spectacular views. For this reason, book a room with a view. The sky line view towards the financial district is very special, but maybe a matter of taste, as surely someone may challenge this and prefer views towards the gardens.  It is a typical convention centre hotel, and feels, and is very large. One gets a bit of a feeling of living on an airport, which is not bad, but less relaxed. Bring a compass and good shoes for walking.  The rooftop infinity pool is of course sort of a landmark, and very cool, but one gets a bit a feel of an overcrowded public outdoor pool facility, a ""selfie paradise"".  The hotel staff service level and attitude is of highest class, and well…",4,
The rooms are expensive but the experience is incredible.  The pool was breathtaking and you almost feel like you're not doing it justice enough just lazing around admiring it.  The great restaurants within the hotel are amazing and I can't wait to go back and explore what Marina Bay Sands has to offer the next time round.,5,
"It was our family's first time to try this remarkable hotel as it was very famous all over the world. Entering the hotel lobby will absolutely make you go crazy because of it's unique design. Everything was in order tho a bit long wait for the line of check in which we expect for a huge hotel as such.  The front desk never failed to impress as and we appreciated her help to do her utmost to give us the highest possible floor available as of the moment. She placed as in 13th floor. A pleasing personality and warm welcome has been executed. However one thing we noticed is that, the agent asked us to sign a document without discussing it to us, which i know it was a legal document since this is a registration card indicating all hotel policies and procedures. Being also a hotelier,…",3,
"This was our second time at Marina Bay Sands and as this was for our wedding anniversary we decided that we would treat ourselves and have access to the executive lounge ""Club 55"". The upgrade to the club room easily paid for itself in the evening canapes and drinks along with the breakfast.  The quality of the food and service in the club room was amazing, and this means that you do not have to eat elsewhere, and based on Singapore prices this is a saving in itself. We have decided that the next time we are passing through Singapore we will be doing this again.",5,
"This is the second time I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands. The hotel is lovely as are the rooms. The service at the front desk was better this year than last year - I found it slow last year so it's nice to see the improvement.   And there is a good selection of excellent restaurants on the property. My favorite is Spago - it's located poolside and is a lovely casual setting. C'est La Vie for nightlight and a great view of the city.  The hotel is also connected to the casino (if you're into that), shopping mall (which was about 3x the cost of the same things in the US) and conference center.  My beef about this hotel is not the hotel itself but the distance from the real tourist location that I would like to be - the old city. There you can find great restaurants, shops with…",4,
Enjoy a dinner on rooftop with most amazing view in city. And take a swim in the swimming pool above the city - a memory that will last! Even the small cafe in the first floor serve amazing food! If your just for one day - use the pass for sightseeing rooftop for great photos. ,5,
"OK the hotel is absolutely remarkable. Everything about it is beautiful. The spa, the restaurants, the shopping, the rooms, the location; all spectacular. BUT there are SO many people in and out that you feel like you are smack dab in the middle of disney world. Which in my opinion, takes away from the allure. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't stay here but visit instead (just like everybody else). To be honest, the only reason I chose this hotel was to have access to the INSANE infinity pool on the roof. I was extremely disappointment to find out that the pool is not heated and it's freezing. We got in to our ankles for the photo and get out. Visit here but don't stay.",4,
"Magnificent view of the lake, big comfy bed, huggable pillows, succulent food, and a shopping haven plus room service like no other...what more can I ask for.  However, upon checking-in..be ready to fall in line at the front desk for more than 30 minutes. Checking out is fast, tho. The pool is long but narrow. The view up there is enough, so no need for me to swim since it was too crowded that time. Drinks at the bar while looking at Singapore skyline was already sufficient for a relaxing night. Will definitely book again here when I travel back to Singapore.",5,
"Absolutely loved the view while swimming in the infinity pool. Viewing at the skydeck was amazing both day and night time. If you are in Singapore it is definitely worth staying, but ask for a room with view of the bay.",4,
We have previously stayed at MBS and enjoyed it so decided to return. This time with a toddler in tow. Our stay was perfect. We had a club room and would highly recommend upgrading for the afternoon tea and evening canapés and drinks. It was relaxing and stressful with a good selection of food and drinks.  Our 1 year old even enjoyed it! We will be back.,5,
"Be it sea facing or city facing, the views from the rooms are great! The view from the infinity pool or from the gym, its the best you can get in Singapore!  Have stayed in Orchard many times before. Rooms are good (Spacious but nothing special).  Poor service. The hotel lacks the premium feel because most people (tourists) just stay here for a night or two. So the lobby is always crowded. A very busy over rated place there are much nicer places to stay in Singapore. Experienced this hotel once, but not too keen to come back here.  We were staying at Room #3586 very close to the elevators.",3,
"Excellent spot to view Singapore from height., Premium quality services. little bit pricey for sightseeing., better go there at evening to see sparkling light of Singapore. Bring your camera to capture Singapore in landscape",4,
"My second stay at this property. I stayed here for 5 nights on my last trip and it could not have been better. Excellent Service, Spotlessly clean , Great views from room , Pool terrace the best in the world. Many choices of Restaurants and Bars throughout the Hotel. Fantastic location with the Exhibition Ctr , Casino , MRT Stations all ajoining.",5,
"Was there once, it was excellent, there service is very good, we were there even before our checking time, but they helped us getting a room very quickly even then. The view is pretty amazing and the infinity pool experience is amazing. You can look around whole Singapore from there. We got a room with park side view, that was a pretty amazing view as well. The facilities provided in the room are exceptional as well. The price is bit high but it is worth every penny.",5,
The hotel and the property is absolutely beautiful. It is basically like a small city and connected to a mall so you don't even have to leave.  The room we had absolutely beautiful and spotless. I believe we stayed on the 42 floor and it had a balcony which is very unusual. It had an amazing view of Gardens in the sky. The bathroom was huge with a deep soaking tub . You feel as though you are in a spa.  The pool of course is magnificent and not too crowded. We stayed for one night and did not want to leave.   The only thing you have to keep in mind that they are VERY VERY strict with pool admission and hotel checkout. Each guest requires their own card and needs to swipe at entry and exit of the pool . Which is nice for security i suppose but also makes you feel a little…,4,
"Although we didn't stay at the hotel we went to the bar and nightclub on the roof garden. Drinks are expensive so be warned but the atmosphere and scenic beauty is breathtaking especially at night. It has become an iconic landmark and is worth in my opinion, paying the entrance fee 20 Singapore dollars each at time of writing. There is a huge designer shopping mall on the lower floors with every designer shop you can think off - I had to virtually blindfold my wife as we walked through! Well worth a visit.",5,
"The hotel is simply amazing from the time you enter. The infinity pool is wow, the view is out of this world. The staff are super friendly and efficient. Can't wait to return. A truly 5 star experience.",5,
"PROS : Everything was perfect. We stayed in very comfortable room with city view. Direct connection to Bayfront MRT and a shopping center. Infinity pool was amazing. All the staff was well trained to inform the customers. Although there was few choices for european guests in the breakfast, there was definitely something for everyone. We are very happy to choose Marina Bay Sands. I hope we will stay here again someday :)  CONS: Early check-out at 11.00. Also, it is not possible to use the infinity pool after check-out. I wish we could use temporary cards to use the pool on our last day. Because our plane was at 23.00",5,
"This place is awesome, having a whole glimpse of entire Singapore skyline. A must watch place in the heart of city to view the scenic beauty of Singapore which is man made.  This place offers a very good view in a relaxing manner after a long hectic tour and amaze you to fullest.",4,
The hotel is a signature hotel in singapore.  Many people dream to swim in the infinity pool on the roof top.  the views from there are absolutelly gorgeous!  But both the hotel itself and the pool are crouded.  Totally worth staying once in a lifetime.  But for my second trip to Singapore which is only a matter of time ))) I would choose more boutique hotel.  Also note that the restaurants on the top floors have child free policy in the evenings (after 21:00 I think),4,
A birthday celebration together with my friends! Awesome place! Clean room that having a very good view! Which we can see the Graden's by the Bay! Service given by all team was good! Best of the Best is the Infinity pool it's a WOW surrounding! I love Singapura! It's a great experience and I will surely come and stay again! Even the bar was great! Keep it up! Well done!,5,
"My husband and I visited Marina Bay Sands for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon. It exceeded our expectations and there is nothing we could fault about this amazing hotel. The staff were wonderful and took extra special care of us with rose petals and chocolates on arrival. It was the only hotel in Singapore that acknowledged our special occasion. The room was clean and spacious with spectacular views of the harbour. Everything was nearby and easy to navigate from the MRT station. The sky park and pool were spectacular. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we hope to return again.  ",5,
"This is a huge bustling hotel, the rooms were fine, however we stayed like most people, for the sky pool. Well you could hardly move up there. On our 3rd attempt to enjoy the pool on our 3rd day, we managed to find somewhere to sit and put our things, the water was freezing! And you could not get any poolside service at all. The pool is not fun, not enjoyable.",3,
"I was doing a special surprise for someone I cared about and thought it would be a fantastic idea to spend a staycation here. Booked a Premier room and asked reception if they could do something special since this was a very special occasion for my special someone. OH MY GOD did they not disappoint! First knock on the door, it was a beautiful slice of chocolate cake and champagne. Second knock on the door later was a special toiletry bag and a handwritten note of their surprise. Third knock was for room service, which I called around 1am in the morning. Best part, EVERYONE was so kind, so attentive and incredibly responsive. Ok I must admit the pool and the view were to die for. One word to sum up this day, MAGICAL.  Marina Bay Sands, thank you so much for making my special…",5,
"Room not really good ,but the view is fantastic! The city view room is definitely be your first choice if the room is available, amazing view during both day time and night~  Location is very convenient as well~",4,
"Impeccable service. Infinity pool at the top is unbelievable with the views. Casino was fun. My all time favorite of all places I have traveled to! You are close to so many attractions, shopping, a great dinning.",5,
Luxury and the confort are always around.  The infinity pool gives you a experience of a lifetime. Isn't cheap but good things have their costs. I strongly recommend at lreast one night in and with preference with the view to the garden.,5,
This is a great place to start if you have not been to Singapore. The rooms and wonderful with amazing views. Plus the skypark pool deck is one of a kind and shouldn't be missed; hotel guests only for the pool.   The adjoining mall is too notch. The gardens next door are incredible - don't miss Cloud park in one of the two dome structures.   But be sure and leave the sands area as you will miss the real Singapore which is filled with small restaurants and great walks. Little India and other neighborhoods which we will explore next time. Hit the botanical gardens too and the inner orchid garden. ,5,
"Be it sea facing or city facing, the views from the rooms are great! Love to soak in their hot pool, located on level 55 of tower 2. For people who enjoy working out at gym, enjoy the view while sweating it out. Nowadays the hotel is strict when it comes to the infinity pool. one must have an access card to access the pool area. good for hotel guests but not so for visitors. Food is expensive as expected. But you can always take the MRT to other stations to have your food. Else, we normally settle for Ding Tai Fung which is a 8-10 mins walk from the hotel towers. Guests pay $12 carpark charges for 24 hours valet parking with unlimited entry and exit.",4,
"This is simply an outstanding hotel, though its expensive but surely once in a life time to stay hotel, and enjoy the infinity swimming. Now some tips not take the club rooms they are at lower level, take a sky rooms which are cheaper than club rooms club is simly a waste anywys most of the time you will be in the infinity pool. And the city view room is must from where you can see merilion and the light shows at night. The garden by the bay view rooms are patheic. Enjoy Marina Bay sands :-)",5,
It's an icon so you have to try it. The pools on the roof alone make the stay worthwhile. It's huge of course and huge places often feel lonely to me. We spent a good portion of our time in the bar on the roof drinking wine and taking in the view. It's a superb memory. We had the family room which was bigger than my apartment.,5,
"Been here for a day, which is one of the symbolic building of Singapore now. One can shop all International brand products & enjoy food. Building structure is awesome & ambiance is so attractive to be here.",5,
"When we were arriving at the hotel, the first word we said was ""Wow!"". Unfortunately the same reaction did not repeat again once arrived at the hotel lobby and being served. Yes the infinity swimming pool has a nice view but that's about it. The room was nice and clean but for the money spent we sort of expected more. Although the stay was pleasant we will not return to this hotel due to the poor services.",3,
"An excellent hotel,well located ,and with superb views all round. A rooftop restaurant with a reasonable selection of wines. Wines are high priced but that's Singapore. Cocktails are cheaper.Good service.",4,
"The building, views and pool complex are incredible. The queues checking in are unacceptable for a five star hotel, all felt very impersonal. I did complain that there was only coffee mate in room, and they charge €4. For fresh milk, so they apologised and brought fresh milk for free. Very busy hotel, only peaceful in your room.",5,
"Look it's an amazing hotel with incredible views, service etc etc. Go stay here but I would not spend any longer then one or two nights as it is so expensive. Make sure your in tower one or two. Pool gets jammed but worth it. Pool food really good ",4,
"A hotel like no other,I couldn't stop taking pictures of the colossal structure.We stayed on the 38 th floor with a room overlooking the park and bay.Good sized room beautifully laid out with wet room and plenty of room to relax with beautiful views.Breakfast was very good with more choices than you could imagine.Staff were overall very friendly and helpful.The infinity pool was amazing and large enough to have a decent swim,apart from having to dodge lots of people taking selfies,lots of places to explore,shopping mall ,casino,restaurants,bars.Food and drink a little expensive,especially on the 58th floor,but you are paying for the views,and dont expect a seat in the sky bar.We had dinner in the Ce-La-Vi on our second night,overall it was good,but my lobster main was tiny and I…",5,
"It was was simply amazing!!!!!!!!! Fantastic!!!! Stunning! The view! The bar! And that swimming pool... uauuuuuu!!!! The best swimming pool I have ever been !!!! It is a bit expensive, but it is worth to stay for a night!!!!!!!!",5,
"If you visit Singapore then Marina Bay Sands is a must visit place. Top view from building, food court, mall and casino etc. Everything is so good. You should give a full day to it. Visit Mall first in day time, then go to top view at around 5 pm so that you can experience day light view, evening view and night view also after 1 hour around.  Then visit food court for some food and then to Casino. You can also get power bank from help desk for your mobile charging for 1-2 hours on for free.",5,
"I have to say, this building is quite simply one of the most impressive structures and feats of human ingenuity in the world.  The views from the rooms and rooftop of the skyline and waterfront are incredible, especially at night.  And the pool, well, it is simply amazing!  Getting in the infinity pool in daylight or nighttime to hang out and take the obligatory selfie (or twenty) is truly a must.  The view off the edge, particularly at night, is stunning and breathtaking.  So happy to check this off my bucket list.  It is worth the very high price just for these things.    The room itself is nice, but nothing special, not for that price.  The bars and restaurants are good but you'll likely find better (and certainly cheaper) elsewhere in Singapore.  And the service is only…",5,
"I'll be staying at Marina Bay Sands on March 25-28th, and it's going to be during my dad's 50th birthday celebration. May I ask to get a room on a higher floor to get a better view if possible?  Best regards,  Tetiana Kudlaiev",5,
One of the best infinity and jacuzzi pools with the view of the majecstic harbor area ever. Customer service and security is outstanding. Though I wonder why they would charge their guests for every local calls.  ,5,
Amazing experience! we were upgraded to their suite which was huge with a spectacular view. They have prepared a cake for my mom's birthday too. Who would ever forget the infamous infinity pool. Sunset was beautiful! This was one for the books indeed!,5,
"The hotel itself is massive and quite impersonal - the lobby area is essentially a corridor with no places to just sit and wait. Also it seems really difficult to both find the way out but also to find away to the bridge to gardens by the bay. However once you escape the lobby the rooms are great, clean, luxurious and comfy. I had a garden view room which was great to see the gardens by the bay.   And then the pool! This was the reason I chose this hotel and although it wasn't quite as I'd expected it was worth it. The view is amazing and it is a very relaxing sitting by the pool and enjoying the water. It also wasn't as crowded as other reviews had lead me to believe. However as other reviews have said there are ALOT of people taking selfies-I don't think I've ever seen so many…",4,
"I haven't stayed here, but this is probably the best wow looking building in Singapore. Inside you can access the sky park and also the botanical gardens by the bay. The views from the top are amazing. There's a casino inside and you can just stop and have a coffee if you want. ",5,
Amazing pool. We were lucky enough to get an early check in so value for money was good. Extremely busy but to be expected in this type of hotel. Room quality is good if a little dated but definitely worth a stay. As it is attached to an upscale mall there is no shortage of quality food options in a well located part of town. ,4,
Stayed at Marina Bay Sands with my wife. It was a birthday cum anniversary from my wife. Had a room facing Garden By the Bay. The view is fantastic especially when the sun is setting. The view at the pool and the park is great. Will definitely come back for a stay . The staffs were great and accommodating. ,5,
The pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool the pool..   Okay you get it. It's the pool. Best thing about this hotel. They have great service at the pool and if you close your eyes and sign you won't need to think just how much that beer cost you.,5,
"It's a new hotel with all facilities.  The rooms are spacious and well equipped,  bathroom has a walk in shower. The room overlooking the tree gardens so you can easily watch the light show in the evening.  The rooftop area is really busy with the pools full of Chinese taking pictures.  Hotel food is expensive compared to others and don't know why this is as it's not a top notch hotel.  There are a number of better hotels closer with better facilities  ",4,
"As many of you i decided to stay at the Marina Baysands basically because of its rooftop pool, to be honest it does not disappoint, it is very unique and it feels so special to swim for a while at the 57th floor, is very important for you to know that even though the pool is huge it gets very crowded and is very difficult to find a spot where to seat.  The hotel is very nice but somehow you expect a little more from its rooms, which are nice but not spectacular.  i went for the New years eve party to the bar ""ce la vie "" on the 57th floor and it was amazing, and the view of the fireworks was unforgettable. ",4,
"I had a room on the 37th floor in tower 1, overlooking the bay which was amazing day and night. The check in process however, was long and tiring as the lines had at least 50 people or more. So, be patient...  The room itself was very big, but I believe needed a bit of refurbishing as it seem a bit outdated. Very large space and few pieces of furniture made it feel a bit empty. The room was very clean and so was the bathroom which was comfortable. The room was good enough to enjoy the view and spend the evenings. The amazing pool was an incredible experience of its own. Swimming high above the city (57th floor) was fantastic, but, as one can imagine a bit crowded at all times. Nonetheless, well worth it. If going to Singapore, it is a great place to stay at least for a night.",4,
"Of course the hotel is nice and everything, but you lack the premium feeling when there are tourists all around. Only the pool is limited for hotel guests only, but it is full of selfiesticks. Nice if you prefer staying in a touristattraction rather than 5 star hotel.",3,
"Everything was superb- The bed was very comfortable, the room was very spacious and seem to have everything in it to accommodate your needs. The bathroom was the size of some bedrooms that I have stayed in some hostels with a choice of either bath or shower.   Infinity pool is indeed worth the hype.  The staff was always helpful.  WIFI is excellent. The view from the bay side is jaw-dropping.  Do prepare yourself for costs of food and drinks in the hotel though you can always eat outside without any problems.  The location is also excellent with the nearest underground station literally around the corner.   It is also opposite of Gardens of Bay and are reasonably near Singapore Flyer to boot.",5,
"Without a doubt the best hotel I've stayed in. The infinity pool was on my bucket list, and it was well worth the wait!!! Excellent service, amazing choice of food and beverage and a beautiful hotel to boot!! We arrived early for our check in and were plucked from a long line of tourists, instantly checked in and given an upgrade! For $600 a night, you expect a lot, and trust me, you get it! The pool is the best I've swum in, the service second to none and it wasn't too overcrowded as I have read in some reviews.  The rooms are spacious and are stocked well, the beds comfy and views beyond anything you will ever see! Ours looked over the Gardens on the Bay! Amazing!!Treat yourself even for a night like me and my friends did. I will most definitely stay at The Marina Bay Sands…",5,
"I do not know what to say and how to describe how amazing is not only the hotel and its amenities but the whole resort around it. Definitely if you're in Singapore you should not only visit but sleep in the hotel. You also must spend a day at the so famous infinity pool on the top of the hotel, also don't miss to check the Singapore flyer just next to the hotel and be on time back to the hotel for the lights and sound show that can be seen every evening in the river at the area of the hotel.",5,
We stayed for nine days as we where celebrating our golden wedding anniversary and where not disappointed the hotel and retail shops are on a huge scale and cater for most needs The staff where great and our room was excellent with a view of the city and marina As they knew it was our special anniversary we returned to our room after dinner to find a cake with Happy Anniversary written on it plus a pair of swans made with towels surrounded by fresh rose petals then found they had filled our bath with warm water which had more rose petals floating in it we felt pampered and special definitely recommend it to our friends and would stay again,5,
"Visited here on business, all I can say is, wow what a view from the top, stunning and a view to remember. But, and there is a BIG but....oh my god, this place is so so expensive, I kid you not. As an example, 2 friends came over for a beer, 3 pints of Stella cost £38 GBP.....yes £38 ! Ok so, if you compare this tobRaffles bar where a Singapore sling cost £17 it seems reasonable, but I mean come on !  Would I stay here again, for sure I would, but not on my own coin lol  Overall very nice, and if you have the money to burn, do it.",4,
"If you're in Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is a must stay! The infinity pool was worth all the hype! Be sure to checkout the sunrise, this way you can also avoid the crowds!  The rooms are really spacious and we had a great view of Gardens By the Bay. Everything was so easily accessible, whether you needed a taxi or a quick bite.  Would definitely stay again!",5,
"Amazing hotel with a great view, either you get a Merlion view or the Gardens by the bay view it is just truly amazing. The best part of the hotel is the Infinity Pool, either go during the sunset or the sunrise, the view is to die for. Though I prefer the sunrise view as it is less crowded and the view is just amazing, cannot be described in words. High chances of getting lost as it is so huge where all the doors leads to some other place.  The Shops inside are little expensive, in case it fits your budget then you can go for it or else avoid shopping inside.",5,
We stayed over recently on our way to and from Cambodia as it had been on our 'must do' list. We arrived the week before Chinese New Year so it was very busy and on our way back it was a few days before CNY so it was madness. People everywhere! If you go to the pool - go early in the morning.  It is an incredible facility - huge. Glad we did it but no desire to go back again.,3,
"Best thing about this hotel is the easy access to the subway station and inclusive roof top pool for guests only. The views are incredible. I stayed there for my Singapore Marathon and everything was just right.   The only thing I did not like is that the hotel staff would come once a day to check the mini bar, that was so annoying.",5,
"Once in Singapore you need to stay at this hotel. At least for one night. The infra structure is insane, top notch restaurants, an amazing spa and the super crazy pool. I must warn though the water is ice cold and it's super windy.  The rooms are super big with a beautiful view.",5,
"Amazing hotel with an view to die for.   The reason we came here was for the infinity pool, and boy, we were not disappointed. Though it was a bit crowded, but it was well worth for the view that awaits you. For the best view, please be there during sunset!   Like the infinity pool, our room which was on the higher floor has an awesome view of the gardens bay the bay. We actually woke up during sunrise to witness the beauty of it. We loved it alot! The room was big and clean. No major complaints. The bathroom was as spacious as the room, and it comes with a bathtub. Everything are provided thus you do not have anything to worry about. The bed was so nice that we all sleep like a baby. There is WIFI too, so please do not worry.  The only complainant I have is the freezer which do…",4,
"I was lucky enough to spend my evening, on Chinese New Year, up at the top of Marina Bay Sands in VIP. To say the views of Singapore from here were amazing would be an understatement.   The bar had a plethora of different cocktails and other beverages to choose from - something to suit every palate!   Unfortunately, I didn't experience the beautiful infinity pool whilst on my visit, but it is something that all of my friends have recommended doing. Many have booked a night in the hotel purely for that reason.   Staff are all courteous, friendly and very attentive without being underfoot. VIP booths were comfortable and well catered. All in all, a great experience and fabulous venue to spend your time in. ",5,
"A very large hotel so the check in/out etc is slow, even with a limo transfer from the airport.  In room check-ins would be nice.  Rooms/$ not so good.  Thought the mall attached could have some restaurants, bars, and cafes along the water front with a boardwalk.  The roof top is much smaller than expected and the pool very narrow.  Good place to spend lots of money and has an excellent view.  It is overpriced and relies on its marketing, if my ego grows I may stay again.",5,
"The pool alone is worth staying here for. The view in the day and at night is amazing. You can watch a light show from the pool. The rooms are big, very clean and spacious. The staff are very friendly and is the best place to stay in Singapore. ",5,
"At our arrival from the Hotel the Hotel Lobby was overrun with people many of whom were not even hotel guests. There were queues at the Hotel check in like I have never seen before at any other Hotel. Locals occupied every seat available around the check in area at Tower 1 with their picnic fare spread open, eating and drinking so that paying Hotel Guests had to stand (maybe this is a asian culture thing). This was witnessed throughout our stay. When we eventually checked in we were told that the Hotel does not alow payment by Diners Club - a Hotel of that size and it limits its payment methods to Visa and Master is not acceptable. Room service was wanton - we only ordered a bucket of ice and had to phone twice after nothing happened for half an hour. Throughout the entire stay,…",2,
The view and our room is absolutely amazing! The service was a bit so so though. What we love about this place aside from our amazing room was the accessibility! My family and I will visit again for Christmas! ,5,
The rooftop bar is an excellent way to finish your day in Singapore. Make sure you get there early enough to watch the sun go down over the city with a cocktail (albeit over priced) in hand. Brilliant views and you can also see the hotel guests fighting for elbow space in their rooftop pool. Put me off staying there straight away! ,4,
"The location, facilities and service is perfect and an experience to remember!! The pool on the 57th floor breath taking a fabulous! It is connected to the Shoppes Mall which is very good, but expensive! The food court is good to try for the local food!  We had an executive junior suite on the 20th floor facing the Garden and it was surprisingly noisy for such a relatively new hotel! It is poorly insulated! The motorwaly goes underneath it and the traffic doesn't stop any time during the day and night!   The hotel lobby is also very business like a local ""street"" as it connects to the Mall and the Casino.",5,
"Almost 100% man-made, but still really spectacular. The combination of the Gardens by the Bay and this incredible hotel make for a wonderful few hours, especially as the sun goes down, and the lights come on. Be sure to ride the elevators up to the top of the Marina Sands hotel to see Singapore from on high!",5,
We stayed in one of the suites with a city view. The rooms were extremely spacious with high ceilings which added to the 'wow' factor. Staff were friendly and professional.  The pool was overcrowded so I skipped that and the check-in line was a bit confusing but otherwise a pleasant stay!,4,
This had been on our bucket list to stay at this well talked about hotel. The check in was dreadful.  We had to line up at midnight for 30 mins with a weary 7 year old.   Some of the staff were extremely rude but most of them were great.  Checking out was just as bad with a line almost out the door.  Luckily there was an express checkout. The breakfast was very expensive and nothing WOW about it. Rooms ok but nothing special but the views incredible.   The pool is fantastic unfortunately we were there on a cold wet day but still had a swim and it really is a highlight it is incredible.  A very busy over rated place there are much nicer places to stay in Singapore.,3,
"We stayed at the MBS for 5 nights in an Orchid Suite to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Firstly, the taxi from the airport to MBS was quick and under $20, we were checking in at about 6pm and were able to walk straight up to the counter (things were busier on check-out day) Check in was polite and efficient, and instructions on how to get to our room in Tower 3 were clear. A porter had already taken care of our luggage, which arrived in our room 2 minutes after we did. When we saw at check-in that we were on the 14th floor, I was initially a little disappointed, however on walking into the room, any fears of a lack of view were put to rest! The suite was fantastic, it had full length windows out to the gardens by the bay on one side, and windows in the lounge, bathroom and…",5,
"The first thing to mention about this place is the management...absolutely 5 stars to Jeevan and Ian. I have already left specific feedback directly with the hotel for these guys.  The second and also absolutely 5 star was the food in the club lounge...best I've had.  The hotel itself has an unusual foyer; it has a shopping  mall feel about it. Not my favorite part of the hotel. Also be prepared to get lost a couple of times while trying to get around, the place is huge so getting lost once or twice is to be expected I suppose.  The rooms are very nice. The amenities in club lounge rooms are awesome (Roberto Cavalli lotions etc). The shower oddly has an annoyingly weak pressure. The beds are very comfortable. Another thing is that you cannot access the minibar without having…",5,
"We booked 2 city-view rooms: Club room for my parents and orchid suite for hubby and me. check-in for my parents was a breeze but for hubby and me, it was a nightmare. We specifically advised the hotel months beforehand that we will be checking in early. when we arrived, our room was not ready but my parents' room was. we arrived at around 1130am. they made us wait until 4pm! when we tried following up, what's worse, they transferred us from one front desk personnel to another. i was already fuming. it was very obvious that they are not coordinating well with the housekeeping staff. we have stayed at mbs every year from the time it was opened and this is the first time we experienced this kind of major inconvenience. the warm hospitality of the club 55 wait staff helped ease my…",3,
Booked a wonderful city view room which was upgraded on arrival to a club room! Infinity pool is something to experience but can get busy! Had one of our best meal experiences ever in the Sky 57 restaurant and bar where the staff were fantastic . On the downside check in was chaos and we were turned away when we got there for being too early and has to wander the shopping mall until it was time. We ordered room service breakfast which arrived exactly on time and was beautifully presented but it was only where the table was laid out that it became clear that the room only had one chair so we couldn't sit together to enjoy the meal. We had originally hoped to to book Marina Bay for all 4 nights of our stay in Singapore as we liked the look of it when we did the viewing experience…,3,
"The famous rooftop pool is certainly worth seeing, and is available to hotel guests only. Views are breathtaking but that is about it, as it easily turns into an overcrowded attraction for selfies maniac! Water is cold, music of the restaurants/bars is too loud and people generally careless, so don't expect to spend a quiet and child afternoon by the pool there! Having said that rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable with striking views and hotel staff, despite the number of guests checking in and out are remarkably nice and helpful. Try to get breakfast too if you can, the buffet was delicious!",4,
"Waw we enjoyed the breathtaking view. The weather was so nice the country is so clean and organized a little bit expensive but it's worthy . We went to sentosa island the ""island of the fun "" as they call it free transportation from island to an other. We can try the telepherique you will see  all Singapore  . Universal studio was amazing with all the games roller costers we had the time of our lives there is highly recommended you a trip to Singapore  ",5,
After paying to get a lift to the top we found it to be a great experience but we decided to have lunch in the hotel and were refused entry by the what I call bouncers (Not the typical hotel doormen)we were courteous as well  maybe we were overdressed I was wearing a long sleeve white shirt black trousers black dress shoes and wearing a black Stetson formal hat that I had just bought in Paris. My wife was also well dressed for the occasion. I may be wrong but I may have appeared to be Jewish and the doormen appeared to be Middle Eastern this could have been why we were refused entry to the dining room for lunch? As I said before I do not know why.,4,
"The Marina Bay Sands hotel is really great as you can see the city from the top and the hotel also includes an infinity pool which is great but the only thing that I hate is the food that is bad because last time I ate the food there, then I ended up getting constant headaches",3,
"We had a 2 nights stopover in Singapore to celebrate our anniversary at MBS. Our stay was perfect from check-in to check-out. We arrived 08.30 am and got an early check-in and upgrade to 47th floor with garden view. The room was so spacious and nice, the bed is really comfortable and the bathroom is big and clean. Nice view over the bay and the gardens by the bay. The skypark and the infinity pool was stunning, a dream come true. A bucket list moment for sure! If you're staying here, I recommend 2 nights, because of late check-in at 3 pm and check-out at 11 am. It's very nice at the skypark between 10 and 2-3pm, since a lot of people check out at this time. The service at the hotel and skypark is very good. Highly recommended! ",5,
"Had worried beforehand that we would be treated just as a number given the size of the hotel.  We decided therefore to book a club room, with club 55 access.  It was money well spent.  Attentiveness of staff was at a level we would have expected from a small boutique hotel.  Staff in club 55 were exceptional, the quality of food and drink second to none. The view from our room was spectacular and the maid service of the highest possible standard (thank you Xi Mei).  We would add that this level of service was provided over a 4 night stay at Chinese new year.  So the hotel was near to capacity on most nights and many staff were there at a time when they would probably have preferred to be with their families. We really didn't expect the service to be that good, will return next…",5,
"Loved the pool, but it was a bit cold in January... . The lobby is noisy and crowded but the rooms are beautiful and quiet. Even the standard room without bay view has a wonderful view to the port, ships and gardens. The pool experience was trully amazing and not to be missed. At least one day at this hotel is a must. Only guests are entitled to entranced to the pool area. Not personalized service but everything works. The observatory is on the other side of the terrace, quite far from the swimming pool area. Great restaurant Sky 57 right on the top beside the pool, not such great views but delicious food, loved the mushroom capuccino.",5,
"Had stayed in MBS for quite a number of times over the years. It has always been a hotel conveniently located with attentive service. However, it's too crowded when I last visited it recently. Lobby was full of guests and it was too busy. Would prefer a more serene environment for my business trips. Weirdly, additional request for one bottle of water is chargeable though which is unusual for luxury hotels.",4,
"don't think of it as a typical tourist gimmick but as a once-in-a-lifetime uniquely singapore experience that you have to try despite the high price tag. had a two night stay in the premier room with city view, which was huge and clean. extremely comfortable and posh. the infinity pool is as fantastic as advertised, great views and well-maintained. do note that the staff are strict with the closing time of the pool at 10:30pm daily.",5,
"Stayed over for the weekend. Had a room with balcony facing garden by the bay. Facing city will require additional SGD $50, so i opt out. Check in was fast and smooth, around 15 to 20 minutes. Car park cause sge $8 per entry and can be purchased at valet area. Food is everywhere. Room was lovely and big. Honestly not much use for the balcony though. The room toilet is big with bath tub. this is awesome soaking myself in water. definitely will be back again. My room was on the 43rd floor. :-) . it comes with gym access and sky park swimming pool which i took  dip at night and morning. swim was good but cold at first.",5,
"Because of the architecture, always wanted to stay here. The room was average; could have been in any city. Very busy  in the lobby areas with both hotel guests and tourists. Very slow check-in and check-out processes; unprofessional in this day and age. Tried to overcharge us upon checkout, not respecting our booking.com reservation. Too busy at the pool area; could not use it because we could not get a seat. Very expensive prices at the restaurants on the top. Nice view of the Gardens by the Bay and their twice-nightly lightshow.",2,
"Arrived at the Marina Bay Sands. From the welcome you get at check in, to having your luggage brought up to a room that is exceptional. I was on the 46 floor and had an incredible view. The room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom was incredible. Room service was wonderful especially the first night as I had just flown in and was exhausted",5,
"We chose this hotel for our three night trip to Singapore as it had been recommended by friends. This was the first time we had travelled with our daughter (5 months old). The hotel check in process was straight forward and the staff very helpful in relation to our daughter. Our room was very nice, the bathroom especially, the view of the Gardens By The Bay and out to sea was truly stunning and every one of our daughters needs was met - the hotel provided a cot, blankets, baby bath, baby toiletries, bottle warmer and steriliser. Staff throughout the hotel were friendly and particularly accommodating of our daughter, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast and dinner buffets were both extensive, beautifully presented and delicious. The rooftop infinity pool was a particular…",5,
What a thrill to stay at this beautiful resort! Our initial room had a view across the bay to the city. We changed rooms to a room with views and a balcony overlooking the ocean and with stunning views of Gardens By The Sea. We had fabulous views of the sound and light show there in the evening and could not get enough of the views. The pool area is beyond words. Make sure to have breakfast on the pool level and check it out both night and day for fabulous photo ops.,5,
"The only thing great about this hotel is the amazing pool on the roof. The views from our room were good also , but rest of the hotel was very average . It is so big that you are just a number to everyone on the staff. Will not stay here again.",3,
"Apart from the check-in process that seemed slow (and the queue wasn't that long) it was 5 star all the way.  The service is excellent. For a family of 4 the extra expense of a Club rooms was well worth it - room enough for the double couch to be left made up & for the kids to play.   With the buffet breakfast, afternoon tea (from 2pm) & canapés (from 5pm), we hardly had to eat or snack anywhere else. Club 55 service was great to - always remembering our name and most staff remembering our room number amongst the many guests. Although we were a party of 6, we always were seated without an issue every visits, even when it seemed at full capacity.  Skydeck & pool were great - it was busy but we got loungers to sit on without a problem.  There are lots of electronic gates at every…",5,
"This is a lifetime experience. You must stay there at least 1 night to enjoy the whole hotel. The pool is amazing, it was on the top of my Bucket List. It is really amazing as the pictures show. The room balcony view is incredible. The whole architecture inside and outside is impressive. It could be very expensive for some people, but totally worth it to try at least. The staff is very polite and helpful. Even with the hotel fully booked, the pool still not packed and you are able to find seats and take very good pictures. The food and attractions are pretty cheap for the whole infrastructure available, if you are used to most of the developed western countries.",5,
"Marina Bay sands is out of this world, the night time view is exhilarating and a nice walk around the place gives a sense of the city.A lot of activity happening all around.A relaxing place to just sit down and let the world pass by.",5,
"The best thing about the hotel is the rooftop pool. however get there early as it gets packed. Apart from that the rest of the hotel is mediocre. The lobby is a bit too busy and feels like a museum. There's a lot of events and conferences going on so would really only recommend this hotel for business guess, as I think there are many other excellent hotel in Singapore for the same price which offer a better atmosphere and nicer rooms.   However I would recommend staying here once just for that amazing rooftop pool and view. As that is what you're really paying for.",4,
"I was staying at MBS for the popular Infinity Pool  with my family. MBS was the one of my wish list to stay once in my life and it was amazing than I was expected.   The room was cleaned and nice, enjoyed the amazing view from the pool but too croweded. I recommended you to go to pool in the early morning. It was a bit cold but less people and more relaxed.  The one thing made me upset is the slow service of checking out because of lack of staff.  Although I was enjoyed staying at MBS and would love to come back.",4,
"Absolutely wonderful experience to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. Stayed in a Club room and paying for those extra features such as breakfast and afternoon tea in the Club room was definitely worth it. Had my best days in Singapore staying at this hotel, can't wait to come back and visit again in the near future.",5,
"We were there this past August and it was nice.  Not certain we wold go there again but worth visiting once.  The day we were there it was not very crowded, but our friends said we were lucky as it normally is very crowded.",4,
"Hotel (like everywhere in Singapore) was spotless and well maintained. Proximity to the park was great, as we like to jog. The staff were friendly and welcoming everywhere we went. I think it's well worth the money to upgrade to a club room so that you can take advantage of the express check-in (on the left as you enter the front doors) and the buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapes at Cub 55. We really didn't need to eat anywhere else and the staff called us by name and chatted to us like friends after the first day. We felt like VIP's! Our room facing the garden was wonderful: spacious, clean and comfortable. It is a little expensive so I think it is more a hotel for special occasions, but absolutely worth doing at least once!",5,
"Singapore is one of the most beautiful place i ve ever seen, the hotel Marina Bay Sands is really a luxurious hotel, and the pool on the top floor impressed me the most, with a superb view of the city, 😊 for sure i ll be back soon! ",5,
"34 floor room with city views. clean room, spacious full of options. highlight the rooftop pool, with night view of the beautiful city. the price is high, but worth it.  Check-in and check-out fast, with great service.",4,
"I spend christmas eve at Marina Bay Sands, everything was amazing from the customer service to the rooms and of course the swimming pool. It is really worth the price and would highly recommend to go as it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Every thing is worth it once you get up at the swimming pool.",5,
"The iconic building of Singapore. Althought it is a 5*hotel, because of its three towers and so we are expecting a lot of people especially at the pool on 55th floor. It was so crowded in the infinity pool whether day or night time.  The rise hotel made us queue to be able to have our seats for breakfast, but you will be satisfied of so many food choices they offered.  If you want to experience soaking in a water and seeing a tall  buildings of Singapore, this hotel suits you. It was an awesome stay in this hotel as well. The infinity pool though crowded is a must place to be when you check in this hotel. Whether you are in a garden view or city view, this hotel will sparkle your eyes.",4,
"Like a lot of people, we stayed here purely because of the rooftop infinity pool. That alone is worth the cost of staying here! The view and surroundings are amazing and watching the sunset from the pool is breathtaking. The infinity pool itself overlooks the city, but on the other side of the roof is jacuzzi's that overlook the Gardens by the Bay and the Bay.   We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel room itself. The room was large and clean with a really nice bathroom. We had a view of the city from our floor to ceiling windows.   The staff were great, helping us with dinner reservations and arranging a complimentary late check out.   A special mention to the staff at the pool who were super attentive and friendly!    The hotel has a mall, The Shoppes, attached, a massive…",5,
"Very good, spacious room, with all amenities. City view is the best. The top pool is just breathtaking, probably the most selfies I took in my life were there. The service is surprisingly friendly for such a huge hotel. The food is very good.",5,
"The hotel is 5 start and an amazing experience if you can affort it, specially the eternity pool and views of the Marina sands area and the gardens by the bay. the lobby is amazing and you can see how the 3 buildings are one from the lobby area. You dont have to be a guest to explore the lobby or the sky park, the restaurants, bars and lounge. ",5,
"Marina bay sands! They've got everything here! Sightseeing,shopping,hotel, casino..  Great place to spend the entire day.. Excellent photography spot! Lots of food options...  I'm a photographer and spent 2 days here! Had a great time!",5,
"My favorite city view of the entire world (Hong Kong is next) is from Flight, the restaurant on top right of the Marina Sands Hotel. The service was impeccable. I did not stay at the hotel but the spa looks lovely. The truffle balls was an excellent appetizer and the drinks perfect. Worth every penny. ",5,
"From the moment of check-in we felt like royalty and couldn't fault the service or accommodation during our 24 hour stay. We arrived at the hotel a couple of hours before the scheduled check-in of 1400h and were able to make use of the room and facilities right away. We were even offered a late check out by the attentive and professional check-in staff which was unexpected but most welcome.  Now most reviewers at this point would jump straight to a review of the infinity pool on level 57, but more of that later.  Room 4001 was perfect - 40th floor - high but not too high to induce vertigo. As you enter the room the automatic window furnishings reveal the fantastic view of the Singapore city skyline, looking right across the Singapore river to the Merlion statue and majestic…",5,
"The hotel is really grandeur in every facility whether it is the hotel complex, shopping complex, casino or conferencing facilities. The rooms are good and clean. The infinity swimming pool and the view from the observation deck is magnificent.   If you are looking for value for money this is not the hotel for you. The charges are really high. Many of the attractions are nearby and walkable. Even the breakfast is quite costly at around 55 SGD  per person. This on top of the room charges of around 450 SGD makes your stay quite costly.   But still if you are visiting Singapore at least a night or 2 stay at this hotel is recommended  ",4,
"Our Room was located in Tower 3 with spectacular views of the sea and overlooking ""Gardens by the Bay"". Room was spacious and clean. Staff were polite and helpful. Some went beyond their call of duty. Checking in was a bit chaotic due to the festive season. Having said that, we were offered drinks while waiting in the queue and there were a number of staff at reception assisting with registering the clients. Overall it was a very pleasant and memorable stay. Thank you.",4,
"Stayed for 3 nights while on a trip to Singapore. There isn't a more iconic hotel in this part of the world and that makes it one of the must stay places in Singapore.  Things I loved: infinity pool, general opulence of the halls, restaurants on the 57th floor, awesome room service managers.  Things that can be better: checkin process, signing up for loyalty program(I couldn't figure out how to get the card only).  Room tip: garden view rooms are totally worth it with awesome sunrise. Don't waste 50$ more for the city view. Visit the Singapore eye instead.",5,
"If you are jiggy with 1000's of people in one hotel and not feeling very special go for gold. This is like everyone checks in(is herded) gets their room key gets changed into the bath robe and roams the halls bars pools etc I kept looking for the fish bowls for the keys.... The restaurants are ok The roof top bats offer spectacular views undoubtedly the best in Singapore with drink prices, wait times and random service to match  More theme park than hotel... The rooms are ordinary but the views from the bathrooms of the  suites is unparalleled  The bathroom is fabulous and the Roberto Cavalli shampoos and moisturizers are worth taking home!!! Truly lovely Value for money there are better places in Singapore to stay This building is one of the most spectacular architectural…",3,
One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in . In so many aspects did it take my breath away!! Room was huge and food and location was amazing along with the amazing views of the city from the top pool !! Would definitely return here,5,
The reason I did not give this hotel a rate of 5 was because a hotel of this size has a difficult time giving a guest the necessary individual attention. The hotel was very large and had lots of friendly people. Food was good. Rooms were clean. Staff was nice.The swimming pool is what drew us to this hotel. Worth it because of the incredible views.,4,
"My husband and I came here to jump start our Singspore trip. The rooms are nice, the sky park is interesting, but here's why we won't be back: there were no taxis to be found at tower 3 and there was no concerierge there to help us. The sky park was crowded and the brunch place there was impossible to get into. We tried grabbing our stuff at 11:05am after getting a little lost in the building but our key cards didn't work. We were stuck waiting for them to let us in for thirty minutes after three calls to the concierge via a hallway telephone. Singapore has so many great boutique hotel options. We will be trying those next time. ",3,
"We visited marina bay sands in oct, an amazing hotel, the reception area was a bit like being in an airport lounge, loads of people just with suitcases walking through or just sitting around taking in the hotel atmosphere, everything in the hotel is of a high standard, lots of dining options, very pleased with the room service and price wise very reasonable with huge portion size, disabled access was not too much of a problem, I did notice a few areas near the pool and bar areas on the roof which had a few steps. The hotel had barriers everywhere which you could only go through with your key card, was abit of a pain but I do realise of it wasn't like this you'd have people just coming in from off the street to take a peek at the views and the infinity pool. the infinity pool is…",5,
"The hotel is more expensive than your regular hotel so better enjoy the Skypark with the rooftop pool when you stay. The rooms are not bad... good size bed, clean, great view from the window. We got a garden view and thought the view was great. I have been to Singapore a few times and did not miss the city view, but if its your first time there then maybe a city view room is better.",4,
"We came to Marina Bay to end our 3 week trip from Vietnam. I honestly feel sorry for anyone who hasn't had a good experience here. All the staff were so polite and went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant stay. The food in club 55 was beyond anything we expected and the views were amazing. Breakfast was delicious and the alcoholic drinks were generous.   We were told on check in we had to take both our hotel keycards to access the pool and it is clearly stated on the paperwork to take them up, so I don't know how people missed that... Our room was clean and we had no issues with our keycard accessing the elevator or not working.  I would definitely recommend staying here and I will be coming back again! ",5,
"We enjoyed everything!!! This is an amazing and unique hotel!!! Inside it's spectacular! There are so many things to do and enjoy that you can spend days without going out. The swimming pool is simply amazing!!! The view from there is unique! Even if the price for one night was very high it was definitely worth it! It's something that you have to experience once in your life!!! They have an amazing breakfast with a fantastic choice. Unfotunately, there aren't a lot of gluten free options and my girlfriend, who is intolerant, was quite disappointed. A member of the staff (Edwick) was really nice with her and he brought some cakes made for her and he also invited us for dinner. They treated us like VIP! The chef and all the staff were adsolutely kind and they really took care of…",5,
"This was my first time staying in Marina Bay Sands, I must say it was a great experience. The view from the infinity pool is amazing, there is even a section for adults only. The cocktails at the pool are fab however quite expensive.  Service is amazing and restaurants cater to every taste.  Well worth a visit, my advice would be to book a club room, as you get a buffet breakfast , afternoon tea, and canapes and alcoholic beverages included . I think its well worth the money as breakfast in a restaurant is top dollar.",5,
"The first impression I had about this hotel is very crowded. When we came to the lobby of this hotel, it feels like I went to shopping mall, not going to rest in the hotel. The room was quite outdated. The swimming pool was also very crowded and cold, full of people who wanted to take selfies. Marina Bay Sands is a place where you can try for experience but not for stay long time nor for a calm rest. Personally I wouldn't stay here again next time.",3,
"Myself and my Fiance stayed here 12/1/17 for one night and were blown away.   We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 where a man welcomed us from the taxi, took our luggage and informed us that once we checked in reception would scan the barcode on our tag and the luggage would directly be brought to our room. Check in wasn't open until  11:30 so we had a walk around the lobby. It was really busy with people checking out and  tourists visiting just for certain amenitites such as the Skypark but there was plenty of room for everyone to be there. The queue for check in check in opened at 12, but the rooms weren't ready until 3pm. The lady who checked us in took an email and phone number should the room be available before then they would contact us to let us know.   You still get full…",5,
"I have stayed here a couple of times now with friends and it is a great way to spend an evening.   We arrived to check in and you have to wait ages, the lines are ridiculous. But, when we finally got to the front the service was amazing and they accommodated our extra needs and provided us with complimentary breakfast. Once in our room there was plenty of space, a lovely large bathroom.   They are very prompt with service to the room and provided us with everything we requested. The pool is amazing and the service there is exceptional. Great people around and not too expensive really.   We had a great night in the hotel and they even extended out check out time. Although we queued a lot for breakfast and check in, somehow I wasn't annoyed because the service was so good.",5,
"Had the option of paying $23 Singapore to go to the sky deck for photos or pay $20 to visit the bar on the same level with your $20 to go towards a drink. Fantastic views especially when the sun sets. Pricey drinks, we got a drink each which amounted to $40, ended up being $50. Must have been 20% tax on top. Better option than $46 for photos only.",4,
"Negatives:  The pool is quite cold. I expected it to be much warmer than it is. There are a few small hot tubs but they are always full probably because the pool is so cold.  We came here on our honeymoon and we were excited that there was a small Adults Only section of the pool to swim, lounge, and sit in the hot tub, however, the ""adults only"" section was NOT adults only EVER. Each time we visited the pool, we were highly annoyed by screamy children that filled the hot tubs, pool, and lounge area clearly marked Adults Only. The majority of the hot tubs and pool area is family inclusive so we were highly frustrated that the staff were very aware of the kids in this area yet did nothing to enforce the different sections. Why have the sections if you aren't going to enforce it? ",4,
"Fantastic! from check in to Check out, this hotel was everything I wanted it to be. Stephen at the desk was great when we arrived at 7:00 after a long night of travel. We had an amazing room overlooking the fleet of cargo ships and tugs. Of course the pool is a destination on its own and our service both in the hotel and at the pool was top notch. Should I find myself in Singapore again, I would happily return to the Sands",5,
"My husband and I splurged during our honeymoon and booked one night at this hotel and it was everything we hoped and dreamt it would be! From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. Everyone is eager and happy to help. Check in was quick and painless. We even got a free upgrade for our room because it was our honeymoon, so that was an unexpected surprise. The room was huge and offered amazing views of the Singapore skyline. We had a separate living room and half bath from the main bedroom and master bath. The master bathroom was huge, with modern and high end amenities. The bellman brought our luggage up and then showed us how to use the features in our room. Once settled in we went right up to the rooftop infinity pool for a swim, by this time it was night and the…",5,
"Unbeatable views from both the rooms and swimming pool. Make sure you get a water view room, though.  The hotel has a lot to offer in the way of food and entertainment options. The restaurants at the Marina Bay Sands are second to none :)",5,
"We stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days, the staff were very friendly and the place is very elegant. We stayed in the room with the view of the Garden by The Bay. It was a very nice view especially in the evening. The room is neat and relaxing, it is convenient to the casino, shopping area and restaurant. We also enjoyed relaxing in their famous infinity pool however, i was really disappointed since there were a lot of people in there. The pool was not that wide and deep but it was packed with people especially in the evening. Apart from that, I really love their jacuzzis (with a view of the gardens by the bay). Their attendants and waiters were approachable and helpful. Altogether, we were very satisfied with our stay here. We will definitely stay here again for our next visit…",5,
"We staying in a Family Room @ MBS for 3 days. Our stay was just few days before Christmas. Although it is very busy period, we find the hotel and facilities are excellent. Our family room is facing towards Garden view, but excellent room service and well equipped with all necessary items. The room is massive and although balcony is facing towards main road, there is little noise of vehicle movements. Otherwise excellent and wonderful holidays. We will definitely come-back again.",4,
"When I arrived with my parents around 11:00 am, a bellman approached assisted us to keep our luggage first since were too early to check in. That's a relief to us not carrying those heavy luggages. We tried to check in and we manage to. FO agent was very accommodating to our request and assisted us very well. After we got our room key we checked our room. The room we had was clean and big. Afterwards, left for sentosa. Our luggages were delivered into our room.  At night we came back for our buffet dinner at Rise Restaurant to celebrate my mother's bday. The buffet spread was better than before and food all taste good. We enjoyed also our dining experience because of our attendant MJ who made our dinner more fun. They even sang bday song for my mom.  Overall we're happy to stay…",5,
"I'm no a huge fan of big resorts but I liked the experience. Many good restaurants, nice mall, big casino and breathtaking  view swimming pool. The service is ok and the staff very kind. Very well located. The art science museum is in the hotel, really beautiful. Also the gardens are amazing.",4,
When I heard the price of a room at first I didn't think the view would be worth it. But it is 100% a must do when in Singapore if you can swing the extra cost the pool and view is a was worth every penny I spent ,5,
"We stayed twice at this hotel and both times it was during Formula 1 race. The hotel is very modern, the view from rooms is fantastic, the roof panorama is breathtaking and a swimming pool on the roof is really unique. I would say this hotel is one of the ""attractions of Singapore"" - must to see. The negative point is that the hotel is too big and it takes you lot of time to find someone at reception to ask or clarify something. We also had problems with hotel bills, it has been taken twice from a credit card (on the day of booking and after - at check out) and it took me more than a month to get money back. I think that all those difficulties are related to the size of ths structure and the quantity of tourists. It is really difficult to manage. For business trip it was ok but…",4,
"We booked a Family Room at MBS.  The confirmation documentation referred to it as a Hospitality Suite.  I was told when I booked it and at Check In that this room was on the second floor, with no view of the bay but instead looked over at the gardens.  It did.  What they did not tell you is it is next to a motorway, and you can hear the hum of traffic behind your patio doors.   It is not intruding, but it was when we stepped out onto the large balcony, and I did not want to sit out there because of it.  Our room, 268 in Tower 2, could also smell restaurant food very strongly on the balcony so we may have been over the kitchen of Adrift Restaurant.  The room itself was extremely large, with a king bed and twins with a sofa, chairs and a table in between (I was later told that the…",4,
"My name is Mr.Singh and I was a guest in your prestigious hotel on 8/1/2017. I would like to recognize Ramesh for making all the arrangement for my stay from the start to the end so mesmerizing. I stayed for a night during the one night stay the service was simply awesome from the start till the end. The room was spacious and The view was superb one cannot imagine: ""It's like seeing is believing"". The infinity pool , the skyline these are memories which will be with my family for the rest of our life. It's view is magnificent. The staff are so very warm and welcoming and the breakfast spread are simply amazing with a variety of choices. Kudos to your team and we will definitely come back!",5,
"One of the best experiences I've had in Singapore. The mall connected to the hotel has everything you need and is aesthetically beautiful. You're also connected to gardens by the Bay, which is absolutely magnificent.   ",5,
"For the price of the room - and every single thing here - it's really overrated. Rooms are nice and views are good but no better than other hotels of this class. Service is very ordinary and rude at times. Massive queues for everything, exactly like the Vegas casinos. The pool is impressive but incredibly busy at all times and the water was surprisingly cold. Overall I'm pleased to have ticked it off but wouldn't do it again, it's simply not worth it.",3,
"What Marina Bay Sands has going for it: location, great views of the skyline, their rooftop infinity pool. Good breakfast spread at their Club 55. Fairly comfortable rooms.   What  it doesn't: very patchy service (likely a function of having over 2000 rooms and the fact we stayed their during peak travel season). We stayed in a suite and despite being in a priority queue it did take us very long to check-in, our requests were misunderstood (please bring up some towels later turned out to be 'do you want an extra bed?), and overall it didn't feel like a restful staycation at all.   I won't be back but judging from the crowds, I don't think it will hurt the popularity of this place.",3,
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands specifically so that I could swim in the rooftop pool, and it did not disappoint.  I mean, the rooms were certainly comfortable, with modern decor and good views. And the champagne at check-in was a nice touch. But I'd be kidding myself if I said that any of that mattered. It was all about the pool.",5,
Stayed in a Club Room with the Flowers by the Bay view... stunning! While at first disappointed to be on the ninth floor... as the curtains opened on our entry to the enormous room... WOW. What a view! Straight over the Supertree Grove. Fabulous service in the Club Room on Level 55. A very special holiday.,5,
"Myself and my fiancé stayed here for one night whilst in Singapore.  What a hotel!! The pool and the views are out of this world!! We had lunch at Ce La Vie which is modern Asian fusion.  The food was amazing and the views were incredible.  Gorgeous lunch spot!! We also dined at Spago for dinner, the food and service again was faultless.  Both restaurants are situated on the top floor where the infinity pool is and as the pool doesn't close until 11am we decided to go back in the pool to enjoy the views!! A perfect end to a lovely evening.    Yes the hotel is busy and the check in service a little slow but this is what you would expect from such a large and sought after hotel.   The actual building itself encapsulates Singapore's ever progressive attitude and a fine example of…",5,
One the most exclusive hotel i have visited. Infinity pool was excellent infact everything is superb. My kids had enjoyed very much. Roof top pub is also worth going. Tip is try to book the city view room as it had amazing view,5,
"Everything about MBS is well thought out. Despite the long check in queue, the check in process was efficident, friendly and very informative. The room is beautiful, spacious and has a killer view! Housekeeping also left a little cute note on the second day with the animal towel, room was clean. Now, while the infinity pool is iconic and amazing; it is very crowded so unfortunately it's hard  to just laze around and enjoy it, but then again it's a huge hotel so we understand. The gym was good, it's easy to run on treadmill with an amazing view they had there. Again though, for that size of a hotel, the gym seems a bit small so when we went there it was a bit too crowded but that's not a big deal.  All in all, we love our stay here and yes, it is very pricey but it's an…",5,
The hotel itself is a work of art. The rooms are clean and in excellent. What separates this hotel from other supermassive hotels in the world is that the service is still excellent. The infinity pool alone makes this hotel worth staying at.,5,
"I've now stayed at the iconic MBS three times and would not stay anywhere else in Singapore.  The hotel is always busy but it combines great service, variety, beautiful rooms (particularly the suites with a Bay view), a stunning pool and club on the 57th floor and a huge casino.  There are high end shops and first class dining. make sure you get a Bay view and make sure that you spend some time at the roof top pool which is just stunning, particularly at night. If you are checking in between 3 and 5pm get dropped off at Tower 3 where there is a check in desk and it is not usually as busy as the Tower 1 and 2 desk.",5,
"We recently treated ourselves to this iconic hotel and the fantastic infinity pool on the roof. Yes, it's on the pricier end of available hotels and while you can probably get fancier rooms for the same price, the package as a whole still works out.  On arrival (after finally finding the correct check-in desk) we experienced a warm and professional welcome. The room was very large, with plenty of room to put and store luggage, spread out and just relax. Huge floor-to-ceiling windows offered nice views across the city. The bathroom was massive, with separate shower and toilet rooms, a big bath tub, two sinks and plenty of light.  Everything was very well decorated and modern, clean rooms, lots of water and room service kept checking in on us each afternoon if we needed anything…",5,
"This hotel is very over rated. Yes, the pool is awesome and makes staying here for one night worthwhile. But it's clear why they don't let you buy a delegate ticket for the pool - that pool is all this hotel has going for itself.   The rooms are nice but not for the price you are charged. The pool is awesome but always packed with people.   In room internet is very slow to the point of being unusable. The checkin process is extremely slow, the bell staff are very slow an unprofessional. Water pressure and temperature are suboptimal, and in our room the air conditioning was stuck on max cold.   If you can get a special deal then stay here for one night to enjoy the pool, but otherwise stay at another hotel with larger rooms and better service.   - 1 for incredibly slow checkin…",3,
"Stayed at the hotel for one night to check out what the craze was all about but I found rooms were standard, nothing special and there were too many people in the pool!  The only good thing was the facilities available at your finger tips such as the shopping centre, the gardens and restaurants.",3,
"Overall I would recommend Marina bay Sands. Checkin staff were friendly and made the process a breeze. Navigating to our room was a bit of an adventure because we couldn't properly locate the signs to guide us. Once in our room we were overwhelmed by the amazing room with an even more brilliant view. I think we were upgraded to a nice room than we paid for, and we were also given some free beers and nuts (It was our anniversary) which was greatly appreciated. The pool, which was our main reason for booking the hotel, had an amazing view over the city, but apart from that the pool wasn't overly exciting. I was hard to find a lounge seat which was unoccupied, food was expensive as were the cocktails so overall it was not the experience I had hoped for in the pool department.",5,
My only advise: Times to go to the pool. 6am-7:30am to avoid the crowd. You get nighttime view and the beautiful sunrise. While avoiding the crowds severe sunburn that I got for only sitting outside for one hour! I'm from Florida and I never burn! If your up for the crowd 1-6pm wear sunscreen. A lot. Enjoy! It's beautiful. And don't sit on the edge of the infinity pool for a selfie! The lifeguard is saving life's daily! God bless him. He needs a raise. ,5,
"Yes, the rooftop pool is crowded from early morning until closure late at night. But with 2500+ rooms in the building I am not surprised. This is what we all come for, right?   We booked a club room on one of the highest floors and we were not disappointed. The room was massive and the services included were what you could expect with the price. Club 55 had a great location with afternoon tea/drinks and breakfast included. Highly recommended!",5,
"What a lovely hotel! We loved it from the moment we entered the lobby. The staff are friendly and polite and they allowed an early (10AM!) check in which was fantastic because we had arrived following a 13 hour flight! The room is very sophisticated and modern- generously proportioned and furnished to a high spec. Great view over the bay and city skyscrapers. There is no noise in the room, excellent sleeping environment. The bathroom is enormous.  We loved the access to the infinity pool. It is worth staying at this hotel only for this. Aside from the Singapore skyline the Gardens by the Bay can be seen from the rooftop, which look incredible a night. The breakfast is quite expensive however it offers an enormous variety of delicious food. I'd suggest to have breakfast in the…",5,
"We have just come back from one night post cruise at the Marina Bay Sands.  We arrived early and our room wasn't ready so we completed our registration process, checked our cases into the concierge and headed to the Skypark/Pool Deck area.  The pool was fantastic.  Whilst not designed to swim in as it is very crowded, it is designed more to relax and look at the view.  There is plenty of sun lounges, although the ones next to the pool are obviously the more popular ones.  If you don't mind being away from the crowd the sun lounges on the upper section are quieter.  The food servings by the pool are quite large and a bowl of chips will definitely feed two - the food is not cheap but I would say reasonable.  The observation deck is great to get a view of the curve of the building…",5,
Omg i will never be able to stop talking about this place! Especially with all the state of the art buildings and architecture!!!! Never nothing to look at here! The shopping is incredible. The views are amazing. The food is delicious where ever you eat at. And the atmosphere is electric! Definitely a must to visit!!! Recommend to try getting a spot in the ferris wheel restaurant at sunset! Wow speachless! 100% tourist attraction as mbs is the place to be!,5,
"I was looking forward to stay at the iconic hotel of Singapore but was seriously let down by a series of bad service. Check-in is much slower than other hotels I've been to. There was a brown stain on my mattress. My wife drove the car here and when she asked where's the carpark, the attendant told her there's no carkpark here without explaining further, causing her to make rounds at MBS only to get clarification on where to park later.  And when we left the conference carpark the next day, the the carpark coupon given by the conference organiser didn't work and when we rang for help/suggestions at the gantry, the person said we either walk all the way back to find the conference organiser or we just pay and go. Maybe I expected too much of a supposedly grand hotel. Never am I…",2,
"I was staying for a night on a business trip, so we had dedicated check-in counters and lines which mitigated any delays. I had a premier room with a bathtub and I found the room spotless. It was a little warmer than most hotel rooms I've been to but it's likely due to the curtains being drawn, letting the sun in. The view in Tower 1, level 47 was absolutely gorgeous. My only complaint would be that we were fed conference-style food for the main meals, which tasted and looked more like a high school cafeteria's; however, the small/bar bites were excellent.   I visited the famous infinity pool and yes - the view is marvelous but the allure is a little lost as it was quite crowded, unlike the serene pictures we always see. ",4,
"Hotel itself is average with check-in lines usually very long, however the pool is amazing. The price you pay is basically to enter the pool really, as it has become so mainstream now! Room size was decent too, managed to get one on the higher floors facing the city for an amazing view of the city as the sun set.",4,
What a place to tick off the bucket list it's gorgeous roof top infinity pool and bars are off the hook it's truely breathtaking looking down over Singapore and it's beautiful gardens! Very classy and expensive but very much worth it once in a lifetime!,5,
The experience of my stay was one of the best I will totally go there again. I thank Singapore for welcoming me like home. I think it is one of my favorite hotels I have been too. I think there will be a big renovation on like January they are going to renovate all the rooms,5,
"3D/2N, mainly for most of the signature restaurants, the malls, gardens-by-the-bay and the legendary infinity pool. Though will be room rates will be expensive to tourists, quick check-ins and check-outs are done as efficient as all other hotels in Singapore (3 check-in/out points). Easily worth a nights stay just for the views!",4,
"Asked at check in for the ""highest room"" possible, and was given a club room complimentary on one of the highest floors. View to the ocean, and was perfect. Everyone was friendly and the shopping mall attached was great. A little expensive, but expected for such a facility.",5,
"This hotel is just all around impressive. Probably not the right address for a romantic getaway but for everything else it is fantastic. The lobby is absolutely impressive, although it has more the feel of a shopping mall than that of a hotel lobby, which is logical considering how many rooms the hotel has. Check-in was very swift and the staff was friendly. The luggage was delivered very quickly to my room. The view was breathtaking and the room was very nice and bigger than I had expected. Everything was clean and the famous pool on top of the hotel was as spectacular as I had imagined. All in all it was a very pleasant stay at this modern landmark of Singapore.",5,
"I enjoyed window shopping in this area and walking about while enjoying the interior of the mall as well as looking out to the surroundings.  Most of the items sold in the retail shops are branded. They are top brands you can think of.  In this precinct lifestyle matters, because it has everything, from posh restaurants, arts centre, science findings, retail shops, theatres for plays, foodcourts, entertainments or attractions, convention/exhibition centres, hotel, casino... There is this manmade canal inside the mall too. Amusing.  Because the precinct it is so spacious, make sure you are the type who likes walking. My feet were killing me as where I come from, I don't get to walk much. So I brought with me a spare of a pair of sandals and band-aids for my blisters.",5,
This hotel is huge! Expensive! We stayed in a club room on the 47th floor and the views are incredible! A must for anyone visiting Singapore - the infinity pool is obviously one of the best pools in the world!  Only one down side is the service at the restaurant Spago - the staff were a bit rude!,5,
"It is not a bad hotel, but not a good hotel either. The services for check-in and check-out was terrible due to the crowded of visitors. This is because MBS has more rooms available compare to other hotels in Singapore. I picked the club room which that is the availability in my trip. The staffs are good and friendly. The problem is the internet is slow until the TV couldn't working. What a mess for a 5 stars hotel reputation. They don't even fill the water for the coffee machine. ",3,
"The hotel is Iconic to Singapore's image and stands rather impressively tall. We stayed in a City Facing Premier room for two nights. Spectacular views, to say the least. The Skypool is breathtakingly beautiful.   Things get a little substandard in the core amenities provided in the room. It lacked a lot of small things which one would expect from a hotel of this stature. No coffee, tea sachets in the room, no milk, light Switches were hidden in the drawers and difficult to spot, no music player (standard in most of 5* hotels).   The Bathroom is a sliding door concept (can't be locked), good to keep in mind if planning to stay with friends or collogues.   Over all, in my view it can be termed as a 5 star Architecture and 3 Star Room quality for such an expensive hotel.",3,
"Attended the UBS Wealth Insight 2017. It was held at MBS Convention Centre and Grand Ballroom. Located on Level 5, it has a good view of the Marina Bay and city skyline. Very impressed with the ambience, amenities and service. Enjoyed the breakfast and lunch too.",4,
"This place is a must visit when in Singapore. Incredible location, amazing food. Well worth the effort and expense. The infinity pool is one of the highlights of our trip. Service was fantastic. Hope to be back again in the near future.",5,
"This hotel is beautiful, but it's such a tourist destination that actually staying here is somewhat overwhelming. We stayed on the 47th floor, and the elevator wait times got to be 7-10 minutes while non-guests visited the rooftop observation deck. Service was good, and amenities were very nice and thoughtful. We could have watched the New Year's Eve fireworks from our room, but instead opted to go to the rooftop bar that required tickets -- take it from us: save yourself the $60 and incredible crush of people and ask for a room with a view of the fireworks instead, because the fireworks show barely crested the view line of the roof (the 57th floor). Also, there were SO many people on the roof, it was uncomfortable, smokey, and pushy. And then trying to get back to our room took…",4,
"This is hotel is great. Super clean, great customer service – I was checked-in early and my flight on my last day was at 10pm and the hotel offered to store my luggage and they offer you access to the fitness room to use the amenities before heading to the airport; amazing attention to details. All the customer service I received was exceptional. The rooms are large, clean and comfy beds. The rooftop infinity pool is a must. I stayed from Dec 28-30 and it was busy but not as busy as I would think. The pool at time was empty - the adult section, the section for family with kids seemed to be busier. This hotel has it all restaurants, pool, shops, spa, and casino. This is a luxury hotel quite expensive but worth a try for the pool and views. I would definitely recommend and would…",5,
"We visited this hotel for 2 days before Christmas 2016 as a stop over before moving on to Australia.  We arrived late one evening and were immediately blown away by its size. The pictures do not do it justice. Check in was fairly quick, we booked a Premier Double room, concierge took us to our room in tower 1 on floor 24 I was immediately stuck by the smell or smoke as we left the elevator. Upon entering our room, which was fine the size and bathroom were great. But the smell of being in a room for smokers was appalling.  We didn't ask for a smoking room on our booking. However we called reception and complained they immediately sent concierge to move us to a different room,  which was appreciated. We went up to floor 42 please note the higher you are the better the room. We…",5,
My wife & I had a fantastically large room with amazing views over the bay to marvel at. The building is so beautiful and as others have mentioned so peaceful and tranquil. Our room was lovely and the housekeeping staff did a brilliant job. I am so glad we had the opportunity to stay in such an iconic hotel.,4,
"Whilst the motel complex, rooms and facilities were EXCEPTIONAL, the service was extremely lacking which was disappointing considering the prices. They made a mistake with the booking and down graded our room and were reluctant to compensate us and make a monetary difference between the price of the rooms ( deluxe versus premium ). There was no milk provided for tea/coffee and charged $4.70 for a small jug. We had late checkout upon checkin, but they cancelled our keycard at normal checkout time, which prohibited us from accessing the elevators, rooftop pool and other facilities. We had to find our own way to our room and given the size of the complex,it was rather overwhelming. Very poor service from a 5 star motel.",3,
"We really enjoy our stay in MBS. We had a great view of SG skyline since we book a city view room and requested for the higher level, the room is spacious and all the furnitures are superb.   When we visit the sky park in the afternoon as expected the infinity pool is jam packed so it's best to go in this area early in the morning.   I also make sure to check the Banyan Tree Fitness Club of MBS and the gym is very inviting since all the fitness machines are top of the line. By the way the receptionist in the club is very strict in dress code, denim is not allowed so make sure to wear proper active attire.  Overall the whole family had an awesome experience and I highly recommend this hotel, it's a must visit and experience in SG even for 1 night only!",5,
"The property itself is lovely, well appointed, close to all attractions, restaurants and shopping. Service however was very very disappointing. Booked a Club Room ... only got 1 hour in club lounge with 1 drink and an 'entree'.  Service was ending but no-one told us so we really didn't get value and may as well of had a standard room at half the price. Travelling from Europe had been awake more than 24 hours .. put do not disturb on the door only to have reception call us to tell us to take the do not disturb off so maintenance could check toilet.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the toilet there was no reason to disturb us.  Especially since it could of been checked prior to us checking in and on the presumption that we would utilise the club lounge (leaving the room…",3,
"Ok guys this place is a must see, sure its super duper expensive but you only live once and deserve to splurge on your holiday. Amazing view from the giant observation deck with a beautiful clean pool, comfortable beds and very attentive staff. I have not stayed in the hotel itself and was purely there for the sight see. I'm sure it's amazing.",5,
"Not our first time to MBS and probably will not be our last .................but it is just to busy and crowded for me . MBS is like a ants nest on steriods people everywhere all the time . The rooms are nice , but showing signs of wear and tear in places . Check was a breeze , as was checking out . The staff were very good with nothing being to much trouble . So , what is it that brings you to MBS .......The Pool area, it is the best view in Singapore......But even that area is showing signs of being a little tired. Overall it's a nice place to stay , but relaxing .....I think not.",4,
Such an amazing hotel! Only stayed one night as it was a stop over before coming home from Europe. I cannot wait to go back again. The rooms are amazing and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Having access to the infinity pool on the 57th level makes the price of the room just that much more worth it. Also if you shop at the hotel in the shopping mall you receive an extra 10% off! Amazing.,5,
We were in the Club Room 4171 in Tower 2 which faces the Marina Bay harbour and city skyline.  Great views!  The hotel staff were superb and nothing was too much trouble - Club 55 membership was well worth the extra money and the quality of the food and drinks was sensational.  Will certainly stay there again on our next visit!,5,
"Loved it. The service, room, bathroom and pool area are all excellent. Would recommend it to anyone. Amazing experience.   We arrived early mid morning. We're asked to wait about 30mins and then we're able to check in and go to our room just after midday.",5,
"I must admit it is a unique experience. The All estate is gigantic. U can stay there without going out easily, if of course you have a good credit card an don' t mind using it.  If you are a shopaholic  this is the place for you. However coming from Europe I was disappointed not to see more Singaporean brands or @ list Asians brands.  HOTEL  CHECK IN very effective and quick but really they could place a robot and it would feel the same (sorry but please look in the eyes of you costumer and take time to check them in when they is nobody in the queue ) we reserved 2 rooms and nop ...they did not Lockheed us in the same tower... why? didn't get a clear answer.

"Always love coming back to MBS as the location is near shopping area, have stunning view. Comfortable beds great view of city great access to shops and casino it was perfect. Spectacular swimming pool at the roof. Good choice of restaurants at the hotel, and nearby. Beautiful room, very generous with materials and space with a superb view. The breakfast was amazing. The staff were amazing. The hotel was amazing!",5,
Please don't get me wrong Marina Bay Sands Singapore is a great hotel. But most of the ads is purely hype in order to get the peoples attention. Its famous infinity pool is so congested and you wont be able to enjoy it. For me not worth for its price. But if your longing for a great picture it maybe worth the try.,4,
We had 8 nights at this magnificent Resort. The Club Lounge food and service was better than any we have ever experienced throughout the world. The service from all staff was awesome. We are planning our next visit.,5,
"This hotel is by far one of the best places i have ever stayed, the service, food, location, room, view... everything is amazing. Even its surrounding is breathtaking, you should definetly stay some days and check out this futuristic spot.",5,
"Words are not enough to describe how beautiful is The Marina Bay Sands... Really!  It's a so big emotion to drink something good looking the Singapore skyline! Listen to me, you have to come! Reserve a night in this place and you will enjoy a special moment of your life 🔝🔝🔝🔝 ",5,
"Decent location with spectacular views of down town Singapore. Large amount of amenities available all around. Also just a short scenic walk around the bay if more is needed. Rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Top pool deck is just out of this world.",5,
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands is always a wonderful experience.  Except the rooms that are so comfortable and cozy and the famous infinity pool, the hotel offers a variety of options in dining.  Every plate at ""Rise restaurant"" is fresh and delicious. ""Bread and Butter Putting"" is the signature dessert of the restaurant and is highly recommended.  ""Sky 57"" offers unique cocktails and a fantastic view , day or night , either to Marina Bay or the city center.  This hotel is one of the highlights of Singapore. ",5,
"Absolutely recommend it !   I was worried that being so big it would lower the standards of service , Not At All !   Fantastic staff , everyone very attentive and all the facilities available were just excellent .  The breakfast buffet is to die for.   Location is great and the all surrounding park is fantastic and an experience on its own.  The infinity pool is of course magnificent with that view.  Really looking forward to going back ! ",5,
"It's an amazing place although very busy.. It was a very nice experience for us especially the infinity pool. Staff were very accommodating.. I was disappointed with the food though, it was a bit of a let down for a 5 star hotel! But still, we would love to stay here again. ",4,
"This hotel certainly is synonomis with Singapore and the hotel, although extremely large, still has a  nice feel to it with very friendly staff. The rooms are quite spacious and well equipped. The only problem was getting breakfast, there were restaurants to choose from but all were set price buffets with no a la carte. The one small coffee shop (the Sweet Spot) had great coffee and snacks but very limited seating space for such a large hotel.",4,
"Had dinner under the stars one night. Enjoyed the atmosphere, enjoyed the walking, a quaint area amidst the high rise.",5,
"The overall feeling which i got from my stay in the MBS was not quite pleasant. The fitness is nothing special or have to say not good at all. The SPA center was small and the fact that i had to be in separate sauna from my wife was very frustrating for me! I know this is Asia... but came on! Separate SPA?! The second frustrating thing was the noisy air conditioner in the room. Even on the lowest fan setting kept me from fall asleep. The next disappointing fact is there is no a decent place for smoking cigars - no ware. No cigar bar, nothing! No smoking area around the pool, no smoking inside. Nothing dedicated for the purpose. You can smoke only stand up like you are grounded bad child! This may works for cigarette smokers, because they are addicted, but not for cigar smokers…",3,
After travelling South East Asia for 5 weeks my partner and I decided that staying at Marina Bay Sands for one night would be a great treat to end our travels. We realised we had made a mistake right from the outset. After spending an hour and a half in line to check in (we were not the only ones who experienced this delay). We had modified our booking two months prior to arriving. Despite this we found we had been charged for the night which had been cancelled. This meant another hour at the reception desk trying to get our money refunded which they told us would take 3-4 weeks!!  Although the building is nothing less than amazing the service and facilities are incredibly underwhelming. A 5* hotel that makes you pay for $20 for a movie that came out 6 months ago.   Please do…,1,
"We stayed here one night so that we could have easy access to the SkyPark and the Infinity Pool. We were not disappointed! The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. We were in Tower 3, which had easy access up to the top of the Resort. We'd definitely recommend staying here (at least 1 night).",4,

So amazed with the structure of this hotel . Really an icon of Singapore. Had to experience and see it ourselves. So glad we did!! Love the infinity pool and the sky park . We got a room with the garden by the bay view. The room is beautiful.. everything is super.. enjoyed every minute of our stay..,5,
Most near n clean city of the world .. Marina Bay 'll represent couple of NIce things . Must visit it. Marilon 'll be very attractive with its changing colors at night. The ship on the building restaurant 'll be really awesome to see the Singapore.,5,
"I love Singapore definitely will comeback,the hotel that we stayed in like Marina bay sands and St. Regis Singapore was awesome. The food was great love the buffet breakfast of both hotels . Surely we enjoyed our stay.",5,
"Decided to go for High Tea at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Very excited and looking forward to a great experience. Arrived at the top floor and we were taken to our table. What a view, and absolutely impeccable presentation. We had two waiter assigned to us, and they were lovely. We felt like queens being treated to whatever we wanted. then the food came out, a little soup in a Dim Sim, very nice, then the usual 3 tier tray with little treats and followed by a lovely liquor icecream. We had tea and then went to look outside at the pool, which is spectacular, and the view amazing.",5,
Our first trip to Singapore & I so hope it won't be our last. Always wanted to stay at this hotel since seeing it on travel programmes & in a film. So happy we got to view the bay from the rooftop pool in daylight & again by night the view is amazing. The hotel is very clean in all areas our room on the 19th floor was very clean and very comfortable. The shower was just great. We booked as a bed & breakfast package and the buffet was fantastic food from all over the world to choose from. On our last morning due to an extremely early flight we had a breakfast served in our room I truly wish we had the time to enjoy the food that we ordered it was just great. We did a doggie bag thing and had it on our flight across to Bali. I found all the staff in the hotel to be so helpful &…,5,
"I like the hotel, although it's become annoying when I go to the pool and 100 selfie sticks are in the water and people posing Infront of me when I'm trying to walk. No sun lounges available because it's so packed. Yes, it's iconic, yes it's an attraction but relax it a little. I hope it goes back to how it once was serene and relaxing. It's got nothing to do with the workers or the service of the hotel though!  I love the location, for me it's central to where I like to go. 👌as for the pricing perspective it's a little overpriced for what it is.",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands has always been on my bucket list and finally we made it last christmas. The politeness of the reception was exceptional despite the fact that they have to get the masses thru, check-in easy and very helpful. The rooms were great (Garden View) with a big terrace. The hotel is not a retreat for a relaxing and calm stay. There is always something going on. Casino, The Shoppes (big mall adjacent to the hotel), the infinity pool, the Ce la Vie club next to the pool, the restaurants... you name it! You can spend all day and all night doing something around the hotel! The pool area is incredible and the view amazing! The catering at the pool was perfect and very tasteful! We had a perfect christmas and highly recommend the Marina Bay Sands!",5,
"My husband & I spent 2 nights in Tower 3, 27th floor. Expensive room due to holiday season. Nice room with Spectacular view.   Since I knew  the hotel was massive when we booked our room,  I couldn't really complain about the long lines at check in and incredible number of people everywhere all the time.   Hotel & rooms were clean & neat, staff was helpful and friendly. Just not my style of vacation comfort.  Similar to enormous Las Vegas hotels with hundreds of expensive shops located between hotel and casino. All depends on one's expectations and previous travel experience if this is right choice for you at this time of your life.   ",4,
"I had been dreaming of staying in this hotel for quite a long time and finally was able to do so during my transit to Thailand via Singapore, as this hotel is located within 20 minutes by car from Changi Airport. Dream came true I must say. We stayed in a deluxe city view room, located in the Tower 3 on the 48th floor. The view of the city's skyscrapers was just amazing. The room itself was very spacious, excellent bathroom, wonderful comfortable bed, all the necessary amenities, not a single drawback with regards to the room. The hotel itself is huge with lots of people coming and going every day. So make sure you reserve enough time in your schedule for check-in and check-out, as queuing at the reception desks is not an unusual situation. Despite lots of people the hotel is…",5,
Amazing experience we had staying over here for just a night.. Although we felt that we should have planned for more.. U would never want to miss this if u are in Singapore.. #Amazing Infinity Pool #Excellent View frm room #Awsm Service #No more words to express!!!,5,
"This was our second time staying at the Marina Bay and it lived up to all expectations. The room was large and the view excellent - definitely worth upgrading to the city view options. We arrived around 10am and were able to check in early as a room was ready, which was really helpful as it gave us a few extra hours to explore the area.   The MRT is right underneath the hotel which makes transport around Singapore very convenient.   The pool is stunning and not as crowded as last time. If you're an early morning person, definitely go up around 730-830 as there's very few people and the sunrise makes for some really nice photos as the lighting is behind you.   It's an expensive hotel but you do get what you pay for!",5,
"Stayed for 2 nights with my daughter of 10months old.  View and architecture of the hotel is excellent. Unfortunately, service wasnt great. We queued for at least 30mins just to check in because there wasnt enough counters and it was busy.  Infinity pool design was great but unfortunately it was dirty. So many guests were spitting around the pool and also inside the pool. It was disgusting.  Pool wasnt great for children. Way too busy and too many people that care more about taking photos than swimming. Also pool was wayyy too small for a hotel with a size of marina bay sands.  The cleaner of our room even stole our baby blanket. It was disappointing. Not worth the price ",2,
Amazing views and spacious rooms but thats where the story ends for MBS. It is truly the most overrated hotel in the world. The quality of the food doesn't match the rating of the hotel. Very strange and artificial staff experience. They even tried to rip me off for the mini bar claiming that if you remove the drink from the fridge to chill your water will incur charge. I don't think that i will be getting back.,2,
Stayed here for 1 night only while in Singapore. The hotel is huge by itself with 3 towers and is one of the most recognizable buildings in Singapore. The rooms were large sized as well. Mainly spent time however in the rooftop infinity pool on the 57th floor during our stay here. IMO that experience alone by itself is worth the nightly room rate. If staying here DO NOT MISS the infinity pool. Would recommend.,5,
"The hotel is centrally located. There was a huge line for the check-in. It took us 1 hour. The rooms are spacious. The breakfast is very good with many dishes to offer. The infinity pool on the rooftop is an enjoyable experience. All in all, there are a lot of activities for one to enjoy inside the hotel. ",4,
"you yourself should experience it, so nice and I think I was locky because I had view of Marina Bay in my room , mandarin oriental is the best in this regard",5,
"Great hotel service, a very clean & comfortable room, amazing views of the city and all that you could expect in a 5 star grade hotel in the Singapore city! Hotel location is strategically located just on top of the MRT station which gives much convenience. Amazing stay!",5,
We visited Singapore in December and we decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands . This was the best Christmas ever . We enjoyed the infinity pool and the lovely cocktails they served.. Staff was very friendly we got perfect rooms ... This trip will be unforgettable for me and my family.. We definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,
"Its was my second time in Marina bay sands, but I was very excited to be there as the first time,one thing you should know this hotel is busy and huge,the receptions are always packed specially at that time of the year, its like an airport, but one thing about Singaporeans, they are aways friendly and educated, they got to be one of the best people out there!  The room is nice and comfortable with a view to the Gardens by the bay, and surprisingly very quiet, from the moment you step into your bedroom you forget the whole mess downstairs.  The club ce la vie is great and if you want to have dinner in one of their venues, please book ahead don't do what I did, i tried booking on the same day and it was already fully booked,but its alright just chill on the pool and go there on a…",5,
Excellent in all respects. Our request for adjoining rooms was accommodated with a sensational view overlooking the gardens and the many ships at anchorage.  Better than city view in my opinion. A tip re the minibar.. it is absolutely full so no room for personal stuff like milk or other drinks but the fine print inside the frig says that a personal frig is available for $10.  I wish I had seen that earlier.,5,
"An absolute pleasure from check in all the way through. Cleaning staff, housekeeping, restaurant staff, security, duty managers are on duty 24/7 and treat the guests like gold. Everything here runs like clock work. The pool area is simply stunning. Rooms are massive for the Far East. If you want a once in a lifetime treat, go and experience what real guest service is at this hotel.",5,
"With a roof top infinity pool and a view of the city,why would you stay anywhere else. A vast hotel with specialty restaurants.We had dinner at Gordon Ramsey's and Wolfgang Puck. Need to book ahead. It is an expensive place . The buffet breakfast or dinner has a huge range including an Indian corner. The rooms are very clean. The hotel is next door to the subway. The gym is huge and excellent. The gardens are closely. The shopping at the luxury sands bay mall is high end. We did not beta single item there.",5,
"The rooms are nice, the breakfast is excellent and the pool on the 57th floor with a view of the city is magnificent. But, the bar is high at this price level and with a super slow check in process, where they couldn't even fulfil what I had originally booked and instead had us changing room at the middle of our stay really pulls the grade down. That they also forced us to get our new room by visiting the checkin area again (instead of just managing it from the hotel side) takes it down to three stars. We could have spent that time differently in Singapore. In general, they have a lot of work to do to make sure that they run a smooth operation from a customer perspective, but the facility in itself is, as previously mentioned, great. ",3,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for two nights on our way back from Sri Lanka to Sydney.  The hotel is exactly what you'd expect. Great room, great view, great pool and amenities. It's also got things which some people might think are tacky, convenient or both such as ""celebrity"" restaurants downstairs, lots of designer shops and a casino. The hotel isn't for everyone but it's so iconic that it's worth staying at just once on your way through Singapore.",5,
"We visited Marina Bay on a number of occassions, this place is stunning.  The shopping, the Casino, they even have a river running through the builiding.   If visiting you must go to the Resturant and swimming pool at the top of Marina Bay, something not to be missed.",5,
"The hotel is great but huge so there is no personalized touch, you will get a coveyor belt like service churning out and processing customers as they check in. When you check in, you get your keys and you walk over to your room. It's so huge that you'd feel like you're walking in a mall. I Would think that for the price you'd be paying, you'd get some decent service.  I just wanted to stay to see what it's all about and how people rave about it.   We had the City View room, it's amazingly beautiful though.  The room is spacious and our room had only the shower. I did not like their shower, the water pressure is low and the hot water takes forever to start running.   Internet keeps disconnecting on my iPhone and I'd have to log in over and over again each time the phone goes on…",3,
"i been here with my oversea friends. well, this is a good place to relax your mind. good for selfie and chilling for yourself due to i like greenary. keep it up   the air there is really fresh. good to enjoy beer here. ",4,
"Have done 2 memorable staycations at this iconic contemporary resort with eyecatching architechtural design, in Surprising Singapore.  The first time I had stayed during the National Day  Parade rehearsal period, and it was a memorable experience to enjoy incredible fireworks display at eye level from the Sky Park, for which hotel guests have complimentary access to, with our hotel card keys. My first stay was in their luxurious 97 square meters Orchid Suite and facing Gardens by the  Bay. But it was on the 3rd floor of the middle tower, so there was not much of a view, despite their large balcony. The suite had a separate living  room and huge dining table, with a bedroom with king size bed. We also ordered room service and the server was friendly.  My second stay was in their…",5,
"Price is high.  The Experience was amazing. The room with city view is incredibly beautiful. Feels like in a movie. The pool has one of the most beautiful views I ever had. The gardens make you feel like in Avatar movie. The staff offers perfect and kind service. There's a metro station in the complex. In fact the mall,  gardens by the bay have free access. If you don't have money to stay in the hotel,  you can pay 25 dollars to visit the pool view but can not get inside it.",5,
"It was the second time that I stayed at this hotel and will definitely return. It is pricey but I think absolutely worth it. Great service from all of the staff, from the front desk to the concierge. The twin bed rooms for a family of four is a bit small but very neat and comfortable.",5,
"Without question, the main draw of this hotel is its rooftop infinity pool. The views and the experience in the sky overlooking Singapore truly is spectacular and you could spend a whole day there without getting bored.  However, the building interior is also noteworthy, with a beautiful ground floor that connects to a fantastic mall and casino with easy access into the city by subway. Service was great and always helpful. Our room, while standard and unimaginative for the price, was clean and comfortable with a great view over the Gardens by the Bay.",5,
"I was expecting the best and wasn't disappointed.  There aren't enough stars or superlatives to appropriately rate Marina Bay Sands.  Everything was as expected, except...the service!!  Whoever is in charge of Customer Service training should write the manual for all other Customer Service related businesses to follow.    Too many examples to list but the staff made you feel like you were the only guests in the resort, they were extremely pleasant and helpful without being in your face.  It was like magic; you would not see or notice the staff, but they would be at your side with a timely ""May I help you, Sir?"" right on cue.   No review of MBS is complete without a comment on the pool; yes, the view is as amazing as it is in the photos and no trip to Singapore is complete…",5,
"I haven't not stayed at this hotel but only toured the public area, shopping mall and river side. It's an astonishing piece of architecture as well as interiors . I will not hesitate to stay at this hotel during my next visit . Unfortunately I couldn't visit the roof garden which is one of the most important part of the hotel . Heigh end shops are all available in the mall attached . River side is beautiful . This place also has 2 casinos,",5,
"Poorly service and over priced comparing other 5 star hotels in Singapore. Ritz Carlton, Conrad, St. Regis are better choice in this price category. The Marina Bay Sands is huge hotel with 1,000+ rooms, it is a sort Disney World with too many tourists. The rooms are big for Singapore, however interior is quite cold. The architecture is amazing.   It is nice to visit the upper deck with the swimming pool. Only too crowded to swim. The breakfast was average. The house keeping was ok.",3,
Just returned to this hotel after a four year absence. Family of four staying in a City Suite. This hotel is still a solid hotel although and an obvious tourist attraction. You are a number at this hotel. There is no personalised service for those who expect this. If you have not stayed here it is worth a stay however you may wish to stay hear first and then another hotel that is more low key.   Access to the Skypark is available to all hotel guests however is complicated to access and costly if not included in your stay. I found this hotel to charge at every turn adding a considerable amount to your hotel check - out bill. Not complaining although it is annoying.  The water quality of the Skypark pool is also concerning. By the end of the day the pool has had many hundreds of…,4,
the visit to Singapore is incomplete without the mandatory visit to the Marina Bay Sands which has already become an iconic destination in itself in such a short time of 5 years! the most amazing thing is how do they manage to deliver such personalized and attentive service in spite of such huge volumes they encounter everyday! Kudos!,5,
"I dont know what happen with this big hotel, once i completed my booking on booking.com the price i get when i check in changed, which is higher, but when i try to find the email that booking.com sent me, the email they sent dissapeared.  According to me, the price paid just for the infinity pool that always full of people, windy and dissapoint me",3,
"The view is truly amazing! We were there for only a few hours and managed to catch the night sky works and show in front of the Shoppes. We bought popcorn and drinks on the deck to snack on. Although we did not stay at the hotel, we were able to leave our bags at the hotel baggage storage room which was very convenient. We were able to stay and take pictures until the closing time.",5,
"An absolutely incredible hotel. The room was large, clean and luxurious. The infinity pool was spectacular. When booking we had the choice of a 'garden view' or 'city view', we had the garden view and Would highly recommend. From the pool you get the view of the city, so getting a garden view room gives you the best of both worlds. An expensive hotel but it's worth it!",5,
"We spent our weekend in this hotel, fantastic service. Its roof top pool is amazing.Rooms are very big, cozy and clean. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Mall, parks and other attractions are all nearby. But it's a little bit expensive...",5,
"staff was very kind and courteous and helpful.  hotel and room very lovely. good location right on waterfront, within walking distance to shopping mall, good restaurants, food court, gardens by the bay, art science museum, helix bridge, and Singapore flyer.  .",5,
"This is my partner and I second time staying here at MBS. The first time was during busy Easter, the guy must of upgraded us because our room was huge and amazing. We loved the pool and everything about it. The second time was not so great, underwhelming and then you realise that you pay $400 a night for pretty much the pool. Our fridge was locked, the room just began to look dull (there were little flies in our room and the side couch was dirty) and the the pool got boring as it's 1m deep pretty much. Marina bay sands is a place where you would experience once in your life. We paid $1500 for 3 nights and believe that there are plenty of hotels that offer a lot more for that value such as including breakfast, a better pool, bigger room for value. Would not be returning anymore…",3,
I have to say that your visit in Singapore wouldn't be complete if you have not stayed in MBS hotel.   The room is really huge and the sofa can be turned into a sofa bed. The floor-to-ceiling window enables you to enjoy the View of the city.   I suggest you book the room with club access to enjoy more of this hotel. ,4,
It is impossible for a hotel of this size to dispense personal service and we felt that we were treated as products in a system rather than guests.  We had been enticed by the infinity pool which was indeed dramatic but this can be viewed by anyone who pays for the privilege although only hotel guests can swim.  I would not return.,3,
"We just went up here for a few hours to see it. You pay 20 dollars for a ticket to get up there, but you can redeem that back in drinks. We are poor travellers so that was pretty steel for us - I got a beer and that was 20 so that was fine, but my sisters wine came to around 30 as there's a service charge. You can't go in the pool area, just the bar. The service was quite slow, but not because it was busy - our drinks were on the bar getting warm and the lady was just chatting to the bar man. Apart from that it was good there. Looks very posh, id like to afford a nights stay there! The view is great, it's worth it! We were there at sunset luckily so it was beautiful!!",4,
"Service was mediocre; not really impressed by the front desk people during check-in/out, didn't really feel any warmth from them - not sure if it's because there were a lot of people when I was there but that shouldn't be a reason/excuse.  But the housekeeping/in-room dining staff were friendly and the guy manning the gate at the observation place was super sweet.  In-room dining was ok and had a variety of cuisine.  The room had a retro (""old man"") vegas kind of decor style which is so not my style.  Really like the location of the hotel, easy to get to other places and there were plenty of taxis. The views from the room were AMAZING.   Overall though I don't really think it's worth the money unless you're going to fulfill a bucket list or something.   Would check out other…",3,
"Sean Liaw 的服務很棒，讓我們放鬆了許多，貼心的想到很多小細節，不僅詳細介紹餐廳，還幫我們訂位。 聽說了我們來住金沙的原因，甚至偷偷在房間偷偷準備小驚喜。 一切都太完美了，還好有Sean Liaw。  We choosed  Marina Bay Sands to celebrate our 7th Anniversary. It is a hotel with infinity pool, famous restaurants and  Singapore best night city view. But We were so worried and confused where to check in when we reached  the hotel lobby. It is such a huge hotel.   Suddenly, there is a guy whose name is ""Sean Liaw"" approached us for giving assistance.  He made us feel calmed and so reliable that he will take care everything with his big smile.  He brought us to check in and also  recommended us few restaurants for dinner, breakfast and lunch while waiting. It is really sweet of him because we were like can't decide which restaurant to go.   He detailed few restaurants to…",5,
"WOW... this was an amazing experience.  Our last night in Singapore we decided to splurge and stay at this hotel.  I agree with some others around the check in experience if you are not staying in a club room, but with a dedicated check in, it was fine. The rooms are HUGE.  the service is impeccable (especially Jessica at check in) and the food and beverage on level 55 is amazing. Yes... the pool and skydeck... what a view, and what a way to cool off on a hot day.  The only issue is finding somewhere to sit - it seems several people take the opportunity to ""mind"" their spots early in the day and return hours later to finally go in.  Everyone is going for that special photo - but everyone is also in a great mood.  There is a dedicated adults section too and jacuzzis on the other…",5,
"Absolutely amazing hotel ,, the suite was unbelievable,, staff very friendly, views were fantastic ,, food was lovely,, shopping centre was fab👌👌👌 will definitely be going back 👍👍👍gardens & surroundings were stunning, 10 minute walk to raffles bar to sample original Singapore sling,, I wish I was still there💓",5,
Stayed here for one night for the first night of our honeymoon. The staff was attentive and helpful. We received a free upgrade to level 44 with fantastic views of Garden by the Bay. The rooftop swimming pool is something out of this world. We have visited it 3 times during our short stay in this wonderful hotel. I would stay here again if we came back to Singapore.,5,
"We didn't stay here (we stayed at the Pan Pacific which was sublime) but wanted to see the pool and have a drink there. As we walked through the lobby of the hotel, i noticed that it was so incredibly busy and very impersonal. There were people everywhere you turned. We got to the rooftop to see the pool which was awesome but again people everywhere. The bar was very nice but 50.00 Singapore Dollars for a glass of prosecco and a bottle of Perrier???!!!!!! Ridiculous prices. ",3,
Glad I decided to spend the money and book a night at this hotel.  Our time in the pool was simply amazing - mind blowing!  What a view!!!  You can spend hours in the pool and not get tired of the chafing skyline.  The restaurants and service while chilling in the deck chairs was second to none.  Definitely will spend the money again.  Loved it!,5,
"Marina bay sands has a wow factor with the rooftop pool and spectacular views. Unfortunately our check in experience was not good and disappointing for a hotel of this standard. We were advised by email ahead of time to check in at tower 3. This is a smaller check in than tower one which is the main check in. Even though I had emailed all our details and requirements, the staff member tediously asked me all the details again (4 rooms I had booked for our family)  and I don't know why but it took him one hour to check us in. Not good after a long flight. It wasn't a welcoming start. And the family was put on different floors which was annoying.  The gardens and the conservatoriums are beautiful. Tip - have a jacket handy - it's cold inside.  ",3,
"Nice hotel made famous by the pool.  The rooms are well appointed and the staff are numerous,  which is an improvement.   An expensive hotel,  but worth the one night,  last night perspective.. My only complaint is the silly ridiculously high breakfast price....",3,
Stayed here for one night for our last night of our holiday...weather was great and so the clarity of Singapore city was beautiful and clear from the 57 floor where the most amazing infinity swimming pool is. Comfortable and lovely room. Many restaurants and bars but expensive. Wifi was free and good. There are many shops which are high end. Expensive hotel but worth the stay. Breakfast we felt over priced. The Skypark is within walking distance....we had a view of this from our bedroom verandah....and all the many ships in the harbour.  Amazing views. ,4,
"I chose this hotel as it is highly rated, however this definitely wasn't worth the hefty price tag. Firstly,  the hotel is incredibly busy, checking in took an hour and there were many check in desks without staff manning it which delayed things even further. The hotel room itself is nice with a good view, however given the price we were paying I expected it to be nicer. The location is excellent, the hotel itself is connected to a mall and gardens by the bay, and all other tourist attractions are fairly close as well. Checking out and having our suitcases taken down was a very long process, we waited around half an hour for someone to come and take our suitcases and had to call twice to make sure they sent someone. It is clear that they have not equipped themselves with enough…",3,
"We had a garden facing, balcony room.1 fancy uncomfortable chair, no table, 1 bedside table between the beds. Bathroom so slippery one drop would send you skimming across the bathroom. No hand rails. Despite putting towels on the floor I had a bad fall the day before we left on a holiday that required a lot of walking in Burma. The breakfast and dining area is set in what looked like a railway concourse.It took over half an hour standing in a long queue to get to our room at check in. No personal attention. The infinity pool is their big attraction,  but as half the world swims in it we declined. It is all showy glitz and no comfort. I am staggered it gets a 6 star rating. It is in a perfect spot to see the gardens and museum and it trades on that.",1,
"The rooms was a great size with a great tub and an amazing view of the gardens. The pool was busy but it's worth getting there to see sunset, it was an incredible experience. We found staff incredibly helpful and they made the whole experience a relaxing as possible.",5,
"What is this hotel big with it's 3 towers! When you walk in your are in awe with the space and interior design. Room was big and luxurious with floor to ceiling windows and great view on Marina Bay and city skyline.  Visiting the swimming pool (sky park) on the 57th floor is a must. As many things in Singapore, breakfast and restaurants were way too expensive. Staying at this hotel is still highly recommended though :)",5,
"Awesome facility, professional staff, outstanding pool, endless amenities. Definitely place to see. But.. Do not expect personal approach. Queues everywhere for breakfast, check in, check out, concierge...  Because of Parameswaran Nadaraja my grade is very good instead of good. He went extra mile unlike others.",4,
"I had big expectations going to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, after all, it does stand out from the crowd as one of the true icons of the Singapore skyline. But unfortunately for the Marina Bay Sands, I had already been to the Pan Pacific and the Raffles Hotel and using them as a litmus test, the Marina Bay failed dismally on the customer service front.   Marina Bay Sands is a glorified people machine that farms you through the door, takes your money and then farms you out again. The ""in-between"" bits are equally average. You are not treated as a guest but as a number.   As far as the property is concerned, the rooms are small, pricey but fabulous. I was lucky enough to have a view looking at the CBD and this was a floor-to-ceiling vista. The shops within the Marina Bay Sands are…",3,
Treated ourselves to a night here and can't reccomend it enough. Amazing views over the city and the rooftop infinity pool was simply breathtaking. Be sure to get a late night swim in when all of Singapore sparkles beneath you. Wow!,5,
"My stay was on dec 18th 2016 for one night. I was able to find the room rate at $300us a night somewhere online. This was my 2nd stay. I think the main reason to attend this hotel is the pool. If your thinking of relaxing by the pool while reading book, forget it even if it's a 5 stars hotel. Lots of kids and family in the pool so forget trying to take pictures. I didn't feel anything special during my stay besides that the room was big and clean. Mini bar has sensor so be careful. Wifi was not strong. It's connected to the subway which brings you to the airport and save money on taxi. The hotel is connected to a huge mall and Casino also by underground link. The only disappointing thing is that breakfast is not included. It's 40$us extra per person. Usually a 5 stars hotel…",4,
"I had an absolutely fabulous time when I came here with my partner. The infinity pool and the rooftop bar completely live up to expectations, and the room and facilities are second to none. The reason this missed out on five stars is the attitude of the staff on my arrival. My partner and I are currently travelling, with backpacks being our luggage of choice. When we arrived to check in the lady on the front desk looked us up and down before saying 'backpacks? Cool!' And then asked if we were there because we get to use the swimming pool for free. After spending the amount of money we did to stay here, I really don't expect this kind of condescending service. Everyone is paying money to be there, regardless of whether they have a designer suitcase or a back pack. Aside from this…",3,
"Comfortable hotel, but no personal service lacks the warm fuzzy feeling. Stayed here 2 nights primarily for the views, specially for new years eve the view of the fireworks was fantastic although watched it from the infinity pool which was not heated.  Main issues are for a hotel of this size the lack of staff around the pool there just isn't enough of them to provide a service without you having to find them. I am use to hotels where they remember my name say good morning etc here you come out of the hotel and its like being at the bottom of an office block where nobody knows who you are.  It is a shame as it is a beautiful hotel and cost was around £700 per night which was room only but wouldn't do it again",3,
"We wanted to experience the infinity pool, as you have to be a guest to access it. We decided to only stay one night and it was a right choice for us. The swimming pool is indeed stunning and worthwhile the experience. The question is whether you are willing to pay the price to stay longer. We found the quality of service sub par compared to other hotels in Singapore. We prefer smaller hotels with great service where you don't feel like you are just a number. This hotel feels a lot like the mega hotels in Las Vegas and common areas are quite crowded and chaotic.",4,
"Stayed there for 3 days;was average ant definitely not worth the price' Nobody informs about any hotel facility, you consider yourself lucky if somebody helps at the reception during checkin. It is like a shopping mall rather than a hotel. Infinity pool is cool at first impression, but is so crowded and so filled with children, obviously everybody is here so went there only 1-2 hours at our first day.Even though we stayed in the hotel we did not go again afterwards.  I would recommend to stay another hotel and go to see this one as a touristic attraction only.",3,
"If you want sophistication this is NOT the place to come.  Mind you we have tried Raffles and The Fullerton and neither matches up to The HK Hotels e.g. Peninsula or SA Mt Nelson.  The infinity pool was heaving. The bar didn't know a dirty martini and apart from being a million miles in the air the atmosphere was an 18 to 30 affair with the supposed dress code being thongs, either crutch or foot, and tattoos. We asked the waitress for a dry wine. She said she didn't have any, only S Blanc or P Grigot. However sweet, efficient manager Darin Kerzeeva quickly noted problems for future action and reversed charges.  We left but the rest of the evening in the tourist area was not much better.  Back to favourite stall with a big Tiger and chilli crab for $15.  The Singapore Tourism…",2,
"I guess I don't need to mention that anymore, but the view from the infinity pool is amazing, both at day and night. But of course that comes at a price...  As it is a five star hotel, the room rates are of course in the upper range. The rooms themselves are worthy of a luxury hotel: spacious, clean and a great view on both city and garden side. However, once leaving the room, the exclusiveness vanishes. The whole place is very crowded (2000+ rooms!), queues at both check-in and -out. Although check-in opens at 3pm, don't expect to be in your room before 4. Also the pool area is always full of people, but at least there are enough sunbeds.  Summarizing, it is more a pretty expensive club hotel with a great view from the pool than an actual luxury hotel.",4,
"My husband and I been staying here twice and I don't think we can stay in a hotel other than MBS in Singapore. We just got back from Singapore for my birthday and NYE 2017 and it was such a great holiday thanks to MBS. The staff were polite and helpful. When we checked in the staff saw my birthday were coming the next day, so he gave us the best room on the top floor in the same tower as the first time we stayed in 2013, where we could watch the whole city and NYE fireworks right from our own window! Then on my birthday night when we had some drinks at the lounge the staff surprised me with a small birthday cake with happy birthday message written on it and a candle! Don't forget the cleaning service as well. They put red rose petals on our bed every day and arrange them so…",5,
"Could only afford 1 night here during out Singapore stay, but the rooms and services are amazing and swimming in the infinity pool on top was incredible. The hotel has great location next to the mall and the gardens",5,
"I stayed here for work and I don't think I would have chosen this hotel otherwise. It's a huge place, too big and busy for my liking. Walking through the MBS feels like walking through a shopping mall. Check-in was extremely rushed and no information was given about the hotel facilities. The room was a disappointment for the high price paid and breakfast was a bit like eating in a canteen (queue to get seated, average quality of food). I've traveled frequently in Asia and this does not compare to the great service and quality you get elsewhere for the same price.  Other than the excellent coffee from SweetSpot and fantastic dinner we had at Adrift, I've got no reason to go back here.",2,
"I had best view from my room. I had best service from the door men and room service. I had best experience in the sky park. I had best moments in Marina Bay Sands.  Next time i will be stay longer here.   A little note from me, Marina Bay Sands lobby for the room registration area needs more comfortable and classy to guest queing, somehow it looks like fast food resto queing. Thank you. ",5,
"Rooms were clean, bed comfortable and the tub was fabulous.   However there were lots of negatives: - I booked a night for my wife's birthday and requested a double bed. When we entered the room we found out that we were given two single beds! I was furious. I called reception right away and they told me all the doubles were gone. I booked well over a month in advance. Shocking. - the lobby is huge but with no apparent organization. There are just swarms of people standing and sitting around everywhere. People are just sitting on every ledge, edge, and flat surface above floor level. It kind of takes the class out of everything. The checkin area looked more like Changi airport than a ""world class"" hotel. Laughable! - Whilst queuing to check in a hotel staff approached me and…",2,
"Lovely Hotel enjoyed every moment ,we were in 38th floor garden view and it was mind Blowing view,the room was perfect and btw the minibar (caution) the min u lift up you will be charged as it is auto charged Minibar. Beautiful infinity swimming pool with the city view.The sky deck is at 57th floor and the club.Amazing view with of the city and just felt on top of the world The hotel is very crowded as the shopping mall is also located there so walk ins are many. Since it was our wedding anniversary, I did mention to the staff unintentionally as she asked if we were celebrating any occasion and they actually sent us a cake by MBS  That was a surprise for us Thank you MBS",5,
"we booked 6 rooms with marina bay sands, we were given rooms as follows :- room no1 :- 4th floor room no 2 :- 21st floor room no 3 :- 42nd floor  room no 4 :- 30th floor  room no 5 and 6 :- 33rd floor   std check in time :- 2: 30 pm to 3 pm we got our rooms at 5 pm . do i need to write anything else?  5 stars for the infinity pool on the top . *****  atlantis in dubai is anytime better then this hotel . total disappointment .",1,
"I stayed here for 3 days with my wife at the end of November. Of course its iconic in its own way with the amazing deck and pool but its very busy and you just don't feel special which you probably should for the price.  The main lobby concourse is very large and is where you have breakfast. The check in zone has airport style queuing fences and posts which tells you a lot! It has something of the feel of an airport terminal. When I was in the check out queue a helpful assistant helped me pay the bill while in the queue and told me the invoice would arrive by email, which it never did. The swimming pool, was very busy and nearly all the sunbeds were taken. The best things about it are the Spada restaurant which was excellent and 2 cocktail bars up on the roof top both of which…",3,
"Singapore is one of my favorite places and this hotel is my favorite hotel in Singapore.  I have to start with the pool on the 57th level (adjacent to the Skypark which is open to the public.)  The views from the pool, both day and night are breathtaking!  There are lounges both in the water and out, along with a park like area that faces out to sea. The pool faces the bay and the skyline of Singapore. I stood at the edge of the infinity pool for hours. The pool temperature is just right and allows you to do just that.   I recommend a city view, but the seaview rooms have balconies, which is a plus. Also they overlook the Gardens by the Bay, which lights up at night.  We did not stay at Marina Bay Sands for the food. That being said the club sandwich and fries at the pool were…",5,
"My wife and I travel fairly regularly, we like to stay in iconic hotels when we can, so on our visit to Singapore the Marina Bay Sands seemed a must, it's not cheap but worth the expense, our king room on the 31st floor had city views overlooking the bay. The whole experience was wonderful from the service to the stunning pool on the 57th floor roof top, there are a variety of top restaurants in house if fact there is a whole shopping area including an indoor ice rink most attractions are a short cab ride away with taxis at the door all the time, there is easy access to public transport or just walk, everyone is friendly and super helpful. Based on our experience I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,
Firstly this is a hotel that everyone should have on their bucket list of hotels to visit. But be warned this place is crowded. I got there and experienced efficiency that only Singapore and Marina Bay Sands can pull off! It was smooth to say the least! Well done to the check in team processing the countless guests waiting in line.  I was disappointed and underwhelmed at the room. I stayed in a club room and although spacious it looked nothing like the room posted online. The shower and bathroom were bare and tired looking. That was the only low point.  The pool was beautiful to look at but packed. But the bar at the top of the skydeck was awesome. I reserved a table and they accommodated me at an outside table overlooking Singapore which was fantastic. The hostess was attentive…,4,
"There's so much to do and see in this entire area, the amazing architecture of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, The Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome and so much more. We went to Singapore for 4 nights, we spent 1 day at the 2 domes, 1 day at the Super Trees and 1 day sightseeing around Singapore. I would definitely return as I considered Singapore as the highlight of 2016.",5,
Beautiful view though and worth paying the $20 to go up and redeem at the Skye bar. Can go up and use the $20 voucher towards a $25 cocktail and only end up having to pay $5 for an amazing drink and looking over the worlds most amazing skylines. High rises lit up as far as the eye can see.,3,
I never expected to receive a poor customer service for a hotel having known to be the best in Singapore. I found hair all over my shower room and it wasn't even cleaned for next guest when I requested a transfer to another hotel. I simply received an apology for my complaint but no necessary action given.,2,
"Large room with spectacular view of the bay ,  best restaurants for dining , good amenities. The Marina bay viewed infinity-pool was crowded with guests all the time no matter how you try to visit there as early as 6 a.m. or lately as 15 minutes to 11 p.m.",5,
"We came as a couple in December 2016. First off, the hotel is by no means bad. It's just that compared to a lot of other 5-star hotels, once you look past the SkyPark and Infinity Pool, it's only average. We stayed in the Deluxe room. The room was fairly good, well spaced, but the shower was really low output which was NOT what you expect from a 5-star luxury hotel. Shower and bath amenities was also less that what I expected - for example, no shaving set, only one bar of soap. Not deal-breakers by any means, just not expected for such a nice hotel.  The hotel lobby is HUGE. It's really annoying how there's no front entrance in tower 2 and you have to walk along the entire span of the tower to the side of tower 1/3 to enter the lobby. Incredibly busy inside, with restaurants and…",3,
"This is the most amazing hotel that we've stayed at from the architecture, the engineering and all the amenities within the hotel. This is the most complete hotel ive been into. the room is fantastic and the view is breathtaking. Staff are so nice and accommodating. The infinity pool is one of the best hotel pools i've seen.",5,
"I had wanted to stay in this hotel and experience the pool for years; I had really built it up in my mind; and it did not disappoint me.   The pool is simply amazing, a true bucket-list experience.  The room was terrific too - extremely comfortable bed, great bathroom, amazing view.  The MBS is expensive but totally worth it. My only complaint: My departing flight was in the evening, so upon checkout, I left my bag with the porter and went away to kill some time.  When I came back for the bag, the porter had ""lost"" it.  He brought me into the luggage room, filled with hundreds of bags, and told me to look for it myself, then he went away.  I was left to hunt through all of those suitcases by myself while a bunch of porters stared at me.  Not a great way to end my stay, but still…",5,
"We booked last ,minute with our 2 young kids on the night of 1st of January 2017.  Room was the premiere one, 47sq m, with 2 kings size bed. But only 2 small bottles of water in the room. 2 bathrobe, and 3 towels in the bathroom... Hotel is huge (lots of rooms), restaurants expensive and crowded and very far from the hotel, most of them in the shopping mall. And be ready for high bills. Only the pool could worth it as it is impressive and could take good photos.  This one is done, won't do it again!",3,
Myself and 4 others stayed at this hotel from the 26th to 29th December. We had one deluxe room and one master room.   On arrival we were told we would have to wait until the next day for two beds (as requested due to 3 in a room). We were told we would have to call down at midnight or all share a double bed. Apparently we payed the same steep price for a 3rd person purely for another key card which made no sense to me whatsoever. We eventually got put in a room with one bed and one sofa bed after lots of complaining. We had to call house keeping every day as they couldn't grasp that there was 3 of us in a room and kept leaving us amenities for only two. On more than one occasion they completely forgot our request after we called and we had to call a second and a third time. On…,2,
"They have very nice view of marina bay but their service is poor. They can't provide us rollaway bed. Four of us sleeps on ""king size"" but it's not that big. They just give small amount of shampoo and shower gel too. I won't be going back. ",2,
"Marina Bay Sands is a complete hotel. All the best restaurants from Din Tai Fung to Cut to Mario Batalli's. Shopping with the best brands. Entertainment. Shows, Art Gallery. The largest casino in Asia. All under one roof. Well furnished rooms, superb staff, one of the best club lounges. The amazing Infinity pool on the 52nd floor across 3 buildings alongside the infinity hot jacuzzis. The cherry on the cake is the wonderful staff. Consistently friendly & helpful. I rarely venture out. We can never think of staying at another property in Singapore. Keep going back again & again & again. ",5,
"Marina Bay Sands dominates the skyline of Marina Bay from just about wherever you are, the architecture and engineering is incredible. The pool is jaw dropping, with incredible views. We found the adult only section to be not too crowded on either of our trips to level 57. The views from the Skypark are also amazing. Take a moment to appreciate how far out from the building footprint you're actually standing.  The service was great, and the room very nice. We had an excellent view of the gardens by the bay, which was brilliant for the nightly supertree light show.   We considered a night here to be a must do, and it lived up to our expectation.",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is like a spectacular and interesting looking jewellery box but the exclusive and beautiful jewels are missing. The foyer was fine revealing the intricate architecture of the building, but the hideous painting above the reception looks more at home in a motel, the check in experience was nothing memorable and the lifts were hot and stuffy. There were people everywhere,mostly I suspect are sticky beaks from the general public rather than hotel guests. Hit floor 57 and you step into another world, into arguably, the most amazing pool in the world. Lazing in the infinity pool (not really designed for swimming) is a fabulous experience and gazing at all the skyscrapers in Singapore. Yes, all your troubles vanish into thin air including the substandard reception,…",4,
"Final night of our south east Asia holiday and a blowout here was a treat.   I have always wanted to experience THAT pool since I first saw it in numerous travel shows, web posts and the like.   The rooms were comfortable and the views spectacular from the 46th floor. The pool itself is a destination. The skyline of Singapore stretching out from the infinity edge is breathtaking.   I am pleased we had the chance to stay here and can tick it off the list. That said I think out preference is for hotels with more quirky natures.   Great for the experience though. ",4,
"We spent 2 days here over New Year as a stop over. The hotel is impressive as one approaches or sees it from a distance and I now think that is close enough. The main hall connecting the 3 Towers is permanently crowded and noisy. Queuing appears to be the norm for anything from check-in to dining (especially breakfast) with queues up to 20 minutes. Our room, a Deluxe City View room, did not have a bath (although to be fair we never enquired about this when we booked) but even the walk-in shower was poor. The bathroom lighting for shaving or making-up is abysmal. Towels could be bigger. The bed was comfy but the pillows very firm.  The general lighting, for a modern hotel, was easy to control but the air conditioning was noisy and intrusive especially at night.  There are lots of…",3,
"Great service, amazing architecture, breathtaking view and spacious room. It's just really crowded unfortunately. I hope they will make a section for quiet people like me to sit and relax at the skypool.",5,
"Stayed two nights.   It's very vegas style, but does live up to the hype.  A must stay when visiting Vegas.  The infinity pool access is guest only and does impress.  Love that an adult and child only pool was available.  We swam in the late afternoon and despite a lot of people in the pool area, we had the pool to ourselves.  There are over 2500 rooms in this property, but doesn't feel like it.   The rooms are spacious, but the two beds were doubles.  Two queens or two even two kings would have easily fit in the room.  We had a tower 3 higher floor view overlooking the bay and it was amazing.   The shoppes and casino are next door.   The pastry shop downstairs was very good.   Tons of UBER drivers available for pickup for wherever you want to go in Singapore.  Gardens are…",4,
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.  I knew it was big and have been to plenty of large hotels. It was the first time that I had to wait in a managed queue line to check in to a 5 star hotel.  In reality It is at best 3.5 stars.  It's owned and run by the holding company that owned similar monstrosities in Las Vagus. So I guess if that is what you are after this hotel is for you.  Our family room was comfortable for 4 of us but the room was beginning to show it's age and the musty smell beginning to creep in.  The building is an engineering masterpiece. The only other positive was the roof top pool. To get to it we had to use 3 different lifts and every single person, including kids need their own room key to get in. Once there it was a scramble to get a bed. There was people…",1,
"Beautiful facility, great location, full amenities, first class quality service with expected high Singapore prices. We were greeted upon arrival and whisked off to our room for early check-in.   Everyone was very accommodating throughout our stay and we enjoyed room upgrade (which was totally amazing!!) for a fun filled family holiday. The genuine warmth of the staff gives this business hotel a ""home away from home"" feeling.   I would like to thank Mr. Ramesh and the Front Office Team for giving us the most incredible stay ever! They are truly an asset and does the hotel brand every credit.",5,
"I had seen the Marina Bay Sands on TV. I watched a DIY program showing it being built. But actually staying there was a treat. We arrived after traveling for 24 hours from Chicago. Our last leg a 17 hour flight on United from San Francisco so you can imagine what I felt like, along with my travel companions.   We arrived around 8am. They had one room available and the couple we were traveling with got it. We all went up to the room on the 30th floor facing the city. It was an OMG moment seeing the Singapore skyline through the window. Our room wasn't going to be ready for a few hours so we decided to go down for breakfast and several cups of coffee in the Rise Restaurant in the lobby. We were kind of dazed by the long trip our waiter woke us up. I think he had seen many people…",5,
"Great Pool (but crowdy), nice room. But concierge could be more helpful. Whatever I've asked them, they always recommended me offers from themself or their partners. (E.g. when I asked for a good restaurant in the city, they recommended me to eat in the hotel. When I wanted to book a Hop-on-Hop-off Ticket, they wanted to sell me the one of their partners although, I had a discount form Singapore Airlines for an alternative company with similar route and better time table. Etc.)",4,
"It was awesome staying with this hotel, one of the wonderful hotel I ever visit, infinity pool on the TOP was awesome eye catchy view from Swimming pool, room was big which was good and view from room window was stunning..had a great experience 👍🏻",5,
"Managed 4 days in a Deluxe room (43rd floor) and 2 days in an Orchid Suite (52nd floor) for a bit of variety. Did the grand tour of all eateries and outlets while there, and could not fault the place. I'm sure everyone has seen all of the pics extolling the finest aspects of this Hotel complex, so I shan't bother adding my few ordinary shots of the amazing views. Staff are keen to sort out any issues you may have at any level, and have no problems going out of their way to ensure your stay is memorable. Very hard to drag ourselves away after only 6 days, and any other hotel we now stay at, has a very big standard to live up to.",5,
"I had two friends visiting me in Singapore and we decided to splurge on a two-night stay, solely so that we could use the infinity pool!  The hotel is definitely worth a visit, and has some spectacular bars and restaurants. However, if it weren't for the pool I'd say actually staying there isn't worth the money (and even with the pool it's touch and go).   The rooms are nicely decorated and spacious, although not particularly characterful (there isn't a ""Singapore"" feel to them - you could be in Las Vegas). Three of us shared a ""three person"" (two person with an added bed) room and I ended up on the camp bed, which unfortunately does feel like a camp bed - they haven't given much thought to placement so it's just set up by the window and really does look like it isn't supposed…",3,
A very unusual structure shaped like a boat with the hotel comprising 3 tiers of approx 56 floors. The rooftop can be accessed for wonderful views over singapore. Marina bay shopping centre adjacent is huge and even a small river inside for rowing boats.,4,
"While on a trip to kuala lumpar i could not resist a 2 day visit to singapore and it was a great decision. this would be the only hotel i would want to stay in and it delivered all expectations and more. We were welcomed by the reception staff and were given a upgrade to a larger room and on a higher floor for better views of the city which was very nice, but it would not beat the views from the pool which i have to stay were amazingly wonderful. Room service was great and service was very good but you do pay the price for it. Highly recommended place to stay one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in.",5,
"Great hotel, amazing pool, nice bar on top of the hotel, and great shopping mall around the hotel, with  great restaurants. Rooms are spacious! If you book multiple rooms for your family, make sure you are all in the same tower, otherwise its quit a trip to pass by other rooms/ family members. ",5,
"My husband and I enjoyed a lovely relaxing weekend at MBS. We checked in after 5:30pm so there was no queue and the concierge desk (Veronica) kindly found us a room on a higher floor (level 49) and gave us a late check out until 1pm on Monday. Our premier room in Tower 1 was very spacious with views of the city and Marina Bay and was quick to get up to the rooftop. Mini bar is fully stocked and you will be charged if you remove items.    The infinity pool is incredible with fantastic views. It does get very busy, and the water is quite cold on a breezy, overcast day but the nice fluffy towels provided will warm you up in no time. I recommend staying two nights if you can afford it as the pool is much quieter between check out and next check in.   We didn't have included…",5,
"Spent 3 days in this hotel, fantastic service, roof top pool is best. Rooms are very big, comfy and clean. Really like this hotel. Mall, parks and other attractions all near by. Casino is in near by. Bit expensive",5,
We decided to stay at MBS due to its iconic status as as Singapore landmark as well as its close proximity to many attractions. We were welcomed at 6am by a very friendly and helpful receptionist who kindly arranged an early check in for us which was bliss after traveling for 14 hours. We found our room to be clean and well appointed with an excellent view. Room service was fairly quick despite the size of the hotel. All in all we think that the hotel is very well managed and will definitely stay here again. ,4,
before coming to MBS I read most of the reviews good and bad but I must say once I got there I could see for myself it is the best place to stay in Singapore yes check in can be a little challenging and yes I also experienced once given my card for the 57th floor got there and it did not work so I just went back down and got it activated no big deal my room was very big with a very cool view what struck me the most was the staff especially at Rise café from Erica to Anne  they were all friendly and professional the only downside was the heat and humidity but no big deal everyone who visits has their own personal experience I must say mine was a very good one just come with an open mind and you will have a wonderful experience and memories you will not wait to share,5,
Marina bay Sands amazing place to be if one visits Singapore. Beautifully built Hotel located in the heart of Singapore. Marina Bay Sands mall and Casino are really wonderful.  Please do visit the rooftop pool where you can see the complete Singapore .,4,
"This iconic building is a fantastic place to stay. The infinity pool is 'legendary' and the location is great. One side looks across the harbour with its floating football pitch; the other side looks across the gardens and skywalk. So, my recommendation to you would be to decide which view you want and request it at check in! Connecting walkways take you to the shopping mall with its designer shops and eating venues. The underground is right on the doorstep too. We enjoyed buffet breakfasts there and found everything to be of a high quality and excellent service. Singapore is spotlessly clean.",5,
Room is clean and comfortable. Spacious and decor is also impeccable. The infinity swimming pool has a breathtaking view. breakfast spread is quite versatile but not so rich as expected from such a facility. Check in was pretty quick and the staff were hospitable and generous.,5,
This is an amazing Hotel...considering the size 2500 rooms the product and service is fantastic. The Lady at check in (Audrey) and the gentleman at check out were outstanding. I loved the size and functionality of the room with the family.   We were blown away by the pool and  View from there. Such a busy hotel had a very highly efficient room service i can say this with gusto as i used them 3 times in a one night stay.  MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT I STAYED ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT!!! I WISH I HAD STAYED LONGER!!  WILL GO BACK TO SINGAPORE TO STAY AGAIN AT THIS SUPERB HOTEL IF NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE:)  ,5,
"although the building is impressive enough to be Singapore's landmark, the hotel was far below expectation. It was even more clear that I stayed 2 nights in Intercontinental in Bugis for 2 nights (which was half price but much better) before 2 nights in Sands. here're the problems with the Sands: 1) I had to wait 30 min standing in a queue to check-in - and there were so many people that there was not even a seat to sit down for my husband who had back issue then. 2) we got a non-smoking room but as soon as we arrived the floor and the room, it was full of smoking smell. I called housekeeping and they sprayed Dettol so badly that it was suffocating. 3) the bathroom door doesn't lock! and no hand shower??? no bath tub?  4) the noise - I could hear the elevators arriving, people…",1,
"The worst 5*hotel ever visited. I have visited many more hotels of this stature and have always felt like a king after check in and check out.  It takes like hell lot of time to check-in. Also when we ordered food by room service, it comes after almost one and a half our later. Even they do not provide extra drinking water which is a big no no for such kinda hotel. Even when you go to the infinity pool on the rooftop, they keep on harassing the guest with the room keys to keep out the non-hotel guest from the area. They should sort that out at the hotel management level. Also the breakfast was the worst experience. Who would like to wait for long queue for taking a breakfast and that too with children. A very small breakfast area for such a big hotel. Even there is no…",1,
Crew is amazing! You feel like special in that place! Pool and Jacuzi experiences are  awesome! Room is really large with a king size bed very very very confortable! Bathroom is large as well and shower is great! Wifi works nice in the room! Hotel is besides Gardens By the Bay! Great Location! Wonderful view! It worths every penny!!!,4,
"I would say the architect of this hotel is fascinating, super high class hotel, no matter the swimming pool at the top roof nor even the room is perfectly cleaned. The foods are fantastic. But one thing that i might be pointing out is the price is way too high which is kinda not a suitable one to the service. I though i would be like most South East Asian countries.",4,
"This is considered as the most popular of the Sands hotel chains. However, the same with the Sands in other countries, it doesn't enjoy very favorable feedback and review because it is basic in many ways. What makes this branch truly popular is its very modern building design. However, when it comes to food and accommodation, there are still a lot of competitive players in the area.",3,
"To the Senior Management of Marina Bay Sands,  We would like to feedback on our concerns for the recent unpleasant stay at Marina Bay Sands on 16 Dec 2016.  It was planned to be an enjoyable and relaxing short staycation to celebrate my wife’s birthday together with our 2 kids (aged 2 & 4 years old). However it started off with an unhappy moment when we were directed by the bellboy to the wrong check-in counter for our Grand Club Room stay, after we have alighted at Tower 1. As this was the 1st time we are staying in MBS, we just followed the direction given by the bellboy without further thought, and to our amaze, it was a long queue with at least 15 groups of people in front of us. After queuing for 10 mins or so, we decided to ask a staff (who walked past us) further and he…",1,
"This is our third time staying at MBS and as always,it was very exceptional.We got the premier room with garden view at tower 2, so we can enjoy the gardens of the Bay and the port from our balcony.The staff friendlines,enormous size of the room and bathroom,also express check out process we're added bonus to the already great experience.Also, check out Rise buffet restaurant during your stay,it was worth it!",5,
"No doubt it’s a beautiful hotel with everything you need but whilst my recent stay I have realized that they have few things to consider to be more customer service oriented. Here’s the list of observations:  1.	Check in and check out timings a.	Late check in and early check out is the most frustrating and unethical practice. The guest are paying for 24 hours and such weird rules are not appreciated. Ideally, it should be 12pm check in and 12 pm check out. You can’t expect the guest to check in at 3pm and then check out at 11am. This is just unacceptable.  2.	In room dining  a.	Ordered a veg sandwich but after few bites I realized, It had an egg in it and it was replaced on complaining but it’s shameful that despite of spending so much of time in explaining what exactly I…",3,
"I am so disappointed with MBS that I feel compelled to create an account just to write this review, while I'm sitting in my room. I travel for leisure 4-5 times a year and there have been some hotels which were not what I expected, but never to a point so low like MBS.   Staff are not professional for a hotel of this calibre. Just to name a few, a luggage trolley was parked in the middle of the hall, staff saw us, ignored us, and we had to maneuver around it ourselves. Our bellboy was playing on his cellphone while delivering our luggage in the elevator. The staff at the fitness centre was very condescending. To be fair the pool staff were great though, but sadly this is a hotel and not a swimming pool.   Rooms are old and worn, despite being just 6 years old. There are…",1,
"It's a factory. You are not a guest, you are part of the production line. Sure the rooms are fine, clean and have all the things you might expect from a five star hotel, but do not expect to be treated as a guest. Early check in is not possible because the hotel is full they say. So they let you wait from 6 am to 3 pm. After a 13 hour flight and 8 hours time difference.  It is probably impossible for them to get 1 room ready a little bit before 3 pm. And when asking at check in if we could extend the room for 1 extra day, it was impossible. They suggested that we went online and try to book a room that way. Very, very strange. But the staff couldn't care less. I think the hotel is such a big organisation that all personal attention has vanished.  Staff in the Spago restaurant…",2,
"Potentially one of the most basic rooms I've ever stayed in - and the AC didn't even work (pathetic considering the price you pay for the room). You literally pay to use the pool at the top - which is full of tourists taking pictures. The water is also freezing cold so you cannot be in the pool longer than 10 mins (out as soon as you've taken your obligatory picture). If you buy anything to eat/drink at the pool, you need cash/card on your - it can't be added to the room bill. The Sky Park is OK, not amazing! The hotel is conveniently located to the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Mall and you can watch the light / water show every evening too at the waterfront (must watch).   I wouldn't stay again at this hotel - definitely a lot nicer hotels in Singapore that provide a…",2,

"I booked a Club Room with a city view for my birthday staycation at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) for a night. Overall it was an unforgettable experience for me and my friend. :) Dedicated check-in/out, staff accommodating our requests, Club55 privileges and of course, the infamous Infinity pool and SkyPark.  Sadly speaking, I would like to highlight the varied levels of customer service at the check-in/out reception. The very tall male staff who attended to me and my friend upon checking in at the dedicated check-in counter was a little icy towards us and made us feel like we were undeserving of our opportunity to stay at MBS. I don't know what had transpired before us, but on hindsight, I think he is probably a bit stressed about his sitting posture (probably due to his height) and…",5,
"Stayed 2 nights. It's the first time and also the last. Because it's really really difficult to justify the price of the rooms to what you actually get compared to other hotels of similar standing but offering lower rates. Is the high price because of the infinity pool? I'm sorry to say that this pool is over-hyped, what you see are tourists who are there more to take pictures than to swim. Guests were not required to shower first before entering the pool (yuk!!) because no outdoor shower facilities can be found. To make matters worse, when I searched for a shower stall, we found only 1 next to 3 toilet stalls. When I asked a staff about this problem, we were told that the policy of hotel is to let the guests shower in their own rooms. I found this strange because to have a 5…",3,
ONE OF THE MOST PATHETIC HOTEL IN THE WORLD !!!  1.Worst Service 2.Rude & arrogant staff 3.Key-Card a big issue...u always need to carry when u want to go to the pool per individual...most of the time it will stop working & u need to go back from 57th Floor to the lobby @ground floor to get it reactivated...  4.U cant order food or drinks @ the Pool side without paying them with the card or cash @ the time of placing order...in other words they wont add the bill to your room no...99% of the hotels add the bill to ur room & its cleared once u check out but here thats not the case.  5.Ur minibar is always locked for which u need to give deposit of 10$ to open it...u cant store any of ur stuff in the minibar...they will levy an extra charge...it has sensors in it...for eg if u lift…,1,
One of Singapore icon is Marina bay sands. Although you can visit the hotel (sand sky park) without staying in hotel but I opt for one day stay in MBS. A perfect place to see the beauty of Singapore and a lifetime memorable experience of infinity pool .,5,
"Compared to other luxury hotels, the check in reception of MBS may lack that wow factor and welcoming touch. We were happy to be assigned a pretty high floor with a nice view of Gardens By The Bay and the sea. The room size was adequate, not huge by 4 or 5-star hotel standards but the high ceiling, floor to ceiling windows and the view made up for it. Bed and linens were clean and comfortable.  Naturally no stay at MBS would be complete without a trip to the much vaunted Infinity pool. Access to the pool and the Sky Park is via the hotel key card, one per person. The pool was as expected crowded and it can get quite hot and glaring in the afternoon. We saw some foreign visitors with lobster red skin so be sure to slather on sun protection. The service staff were quite diligent…",4,
"Our room was at the 43rd floor and had a great view to the Gardens By the Bay. Although I would very much prefer the view to the city. Nevertheless, we were able to access the infinity pool and the observatory deck. The room was spacious, and clean. My kids loved the bath tub, as usual.",5,
"You pay a good price & queue up for minimum 45 minutes to Check in & again queue up for another 15 minutes to Check out. Between 12 pm to 3 pm, The Lobby feels like a Crowded Market place. I guess the Hotels only Selling point is Its Rooftop Pool & its Structure. The rooms are good & decent. The staff at Breakfast areas are too rude & need to go through some guests management training programme. To access the rooftop pool , Each one needs to carry room card keys, At times the keys wont work & you have to come all the way down and queue up at reception to Revalidate your key. This is highly inconvenient. During Check out hours. One should be lucky to get space in the lift to get down to the lobby before 15 minutes. The casino & the Shoppes are inside the Hotel which is only a…",4,
"This is a very expensive hotel but worth it for the rooftop infinity pool alone. Check in was very slow and overall the whole experience was a bit impersonal. However, the room was good and we had breakfast both days by the swimming pool in the Spago restaurant. Well situated, just a 5 minute walk to Gardens by the Bay and it has an MRT station in the underground complex.",4,
"3 nights enjoying my room at marina bay sands were excellent. I like the interior of my room, specially connecting to the suite for my other family. provide nespresso coffee machine with so many taste bullets/capsules of coffee.main pool and the bar at the roof top were perfect for sunset. breakfast choices and taste were excellent.",5,
"First off the hotel itself is an amazing feat of engineering and looks amazing within the marina bay area against the city backdrop. We stayed for four nights as a ""must have experience""...the rooms were generous in size and facilities, the views stunning over the Bay and the city - we were located on the 26th floor and plenty high enough to absorb the views. With over 2500 rooms you can guess the place is extremely busy with day trippers and hotel guests, the lobby is daunting when you first arrive and check-in unfortunately wasn't a great experience taking over 45 minutes to finalise (they had not organised adjoining rooms for our teenagers) after finally having this sorted out the service from then on in was very good for all needs. We ate breakfast on the top floor - Spagos…",4,
"This is the place you see on every single travel bucket list and dreamy instagram post. Well, it's even better in reality. The hotel itself is beautiful, staff friendly and options endless. But the infinity pool is a whole different level. The pool stretches above the city, with beach chairs right on the water. The kids and adult section are separated so you can enjoy the view without the splashes. Definitely go during sunset or sunrise to see the city lights. Or even better watch a thunder storm from up top. ",5,
One of the best places of Singapore - Every visitor must going Singapore must watch this awesome place - Lot of things to do nearby and you cannot get fed up even if you go this continuously for 10 odd days .. Great place to check out !!,4,
This building looks amazing from the ground and well worth a trip to the roof for the fantastic view. We paid $20SD each for a drinks voucher for rooftop restaurant/bar and trip in lift. This paid for one drink each. View made it well worth it. ,5,
"Luxurious and iconic hotel with its famous rooftop infinity pool.   Hotel includes a casino and adjoins (through walkways - easiest are the underground walkways) a luxury shopping mall (The Shoppes); good size shopping mall mainly with luxury brands.   Well appointed room and bathroom. Comfortable. Automatic blinds etc.   Great housekeeping service. Found a cute elephant made of towels after one service. Was a nice touch.   Hotel rooms are mainly in 3 towers; Towers 1 to 3. We were in Tower 3 that provided direct pool access (not sure of the other towers). If you are on the lower floors, 2 sets of lifts are required to access the rooftop/pool.  If you can, one of the higher floors would be more convenient.   The rooftop (sky park) is accessible for a fee (free to hotel guests).…",5,

Worth staying for once in lifetime infinity pool experience.  Fighting crowds at the pool area aren't as bad as dealing with all the small kids. There are 2 big areas for families then One small for adults only. There is a children's pool but it is limited and we unfortunately sat under the glass partition. Kids were allowed water guns  which they promptly kept shooting over the glass to us below.   Staff was very helpful and kind. Even the lifeguards tried their best.   Trying to order drinks and food poolside was a challenge. Finally moved over to the adult side as it opened up around sunset.   Rooms were spacious but the entire experience was not a 5 star. Our keys would not work and we had to return to the lobby several times. It was NOT our cell phones as they strongly…,4,
"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands with my family (wife, toddler and baby) for a long weekend just before Christmas. The hotel is made of 3 towers with the pool on top. We were attracted by the location and the pool but we were disappointed immediately after arrival. Checking in had a significant queue to manage all people to that urge complex. We jumped the queue because of the baby but we can't avoid noticing it.  The same would happen for breakfast mainly if you sleep late. This is hard to accept when you pay a premium for a high end hotel. Staff are very professional and nice making all efforts to attend to your needs in a very efficient way. The pool on top was also overcrowded and the water extremely cold. The room was as expected with the usual amenities. The ac was not working…",3,

We also ate at the restaurant on the 57th floor and the food was lovely.  Check in and out was very straight forward, our room was spacious and always clean, the service was friendly.  All in all I'm not sure we'll stay here again but glad we did it once.",4,
"Just like the photos you see. Just as beautiful. The room was impeccable. Our balcony looked out to Gardens By The Bay which was very nice and different from the pool view. Everything was top notch, clean and staff were friendly. Gym on the 55th floor was very cool. Spago on the roof top for buffet breakfast was a delight. Adrift for dinner is great as well as they feature $50 bottles of wine, great steak, great music, great atmosphere. Will definitely come back! ",5,
"One night is not cheap but at the same time you get access to the pool. If you are tight on budget stay in hostels but save enogh money even for one night here. It is hard to define what do you feel when you are on top. Moreover, it is very safe here. There is some optical illusion which makes you to think you are on the edge. However, below you there is some space which may save some lives in future from falling.",5,
"I guess for most of us,  staying here is all for the infinity pool experience that is only accessible to the hotel guests.   The pool area is usually very crowded with high-security controls, there are a few bars and restaurants so expecting a pure party like pool scene that's really not for my liking.   However, going there in the morning - before 10am is much less crowded, no parties and the view is, of course, magnificent!  The room is compatible to the (discounted) price tag, it is spacious and the bed is extremely comfortable.  We had a garden facing room which is very quiet with a great sunrise view, we also stayed in one of the city view rooms before, I don't think it worth the extra money. We also enjoyed the little surprise ""art work"" done by the maid each day using…",4,

"Marina Bay Sands is a huge hotel Las Vegas style, with great location, amazing views and a World famous panoramic swimming pool. This pretty much sums it up.  Everything here is expensive - rooms, food, shopping -  which does not prevent the hotel from being full.  Long queues for check in and check out, with staff trying to do their best but missing that welcoming attitude that we felt all over Singapore.  Good size room with a classic decor, too classic for an hotel with such a modern architecture.  It is connected to the mall, where most of the stores are high end and with some restaurants with renowned chefs.  Yes, we enjoyed the pool (although the water was cold, be prepared!), the views (come before 8AM or you will have to fight for a spot) and the location, walking…",4,
"Stayed here 1n for our annual affair. It is a fantastic hotel with spacious nice rooms and comfortable bed worthy of 4.5stars but could do with a new round of refurbishing as it is already dated over 5 years. All ammenities and toiletries are provided for and i had prefer a city view but you don't get a balcony for that. A dip in the infinity pool is a must plus get a pool bed and order some french fries. The mall beneath is big so you will need to walk about 10mins just to get to the nearest 7-11 or supermarket. Food options are aplenty and just make sure you bring sufficient cash or your credit card along ;)  Relax, have fun and enjoy your stay",5,

"Just visited this place for almost 4 times and the views never gets old. Marina Bay and the Gardens by the Bay are one of the best man made structure that i've seen personally. I truly recommend to visit this place atleast once and its worth the money since there are lots of restaurants, food stalls, coffee shop and benches to sit around and gaze the surroundings.",5,
"Like many people, I have seen the iconic photos of this hotel and the roof-top pool. This is a VERY large hotel, and with the size comes a lot of people. The rooms themselves are nice, but four-star like. The service was good, but not amazing. I would suggest some of the other hotels in the bay, if you are going to be staying here for more than a night or two.",4,
Marina Bay Sands hotel has been one of famous icon in Singapore but stayed there not as good as I thought. Lobby was too crowded and has long queue on receptions. I checked in at lounge and all smooth. Room was big and got marina view which is nice. Bath room was functional with separated shower and toilet.  All staffs were nice but the parking guy at taxi stop was impatient. I travel with the kids and a lot of luggage but he seems didnt care and grabbed my suitcases as fast as he can from the car trunk then bam! He broke my suitcase handle without saying sorry or anything. Yup he even didnt look at my face. Nice job from a very front staff at 5-star hotel.,3,

"Wow - this hotel is not the relaxing place to go to chill out.  The pool was beautiful but spoilt by too many self obsessed, ill mannered  Asians taking selfies, which made it like a fun park.  Im glad i wasn't paying to stay there.  My fiance was at a conference there and we stayed there for convenience.  Felt like a theme park",4,

We did not consume the champagne and I even put it back during check out. I trust the front desk staff that they will check and it will not be bill. A month later, my credit card was billed $65 for that bottle I swear I did not consume. Have been contacting the front desk but till date, no follow up...This is really bad experience and so cheated. If possible, pay cash when you check-out because they will add in charges in your credit card and give you a rude shock.",1,
Amazing infinite pool ! It's worth a stay as the infinite pool is just amazing and you must be a guest in order to access it - otherwise the hotel doesn't offer for its price anything  ( not breakfast included and we paid around $250) else ,5,
"Hotel was amazing! The views the rooms the pool and the location are perfect However, the check in process is annoying, I get that it's a massive hotel and you need to start check in at a certain time but it could be a lot more organised, it took longer than it should and I'd expect more from this hotel",5,
"At first, we thought it was a refined 4**** hotel but as we stepped in, crowds of tourists and asian youngsters were all over. Loud, dressed down, and rude, they give a very cheap image of the hotel. Next, is the industrial like check-in with non a non trained staff. In less than 5 minutes you are in... the circus ! By the time you reach you room, you realize that your ""dream-maker"" at the counter did not listen to you. You are now served a twin bedded room instead of a double bed... If you call the reception from the room, you are on a wait for 30 minutes... When you call back, no apologies, nor for your luggage lost somewhere in the hotel.... Finally, one and a half hour later we were accommodated. Next is the swimming pool, because we were so stupid to book a swimming pool…",2,

Wow. We were blown away with the view being so high up in the air looking down at the bay. Their bar is a nice size you cannot enter the pool area though unless you are staying there ( have a room) which was kind of a bummer since it was so beautiful. Rooms start around 200 usd for a night. We will stay next time just for the pool experience!,5,
"This is the new Singapore.  If you want the older, refined, more traditional Singapore, best stick to Downtown, Orchard Street, or Boat and Clarke Quays.  But, there is no denying the excitement, energy, and growth spirit embodied in the Marina Bay development.  My wife and I have visited Singapore many times and have usually opted for the ""traditional"" experience -- this time we wanted something new.  We were very impressed with the hotel and the overall development.  Check-in and the Room.  Arrival at the Marina Bay Sands is a little chaotic -- there are many, many tourists, mainly from China and India, based on our experience.  Check-in was fairly efficient, and the hotel has organized a queuing system -- a good thing!  Given that the doors to the outside are always opening…",4,
you haven't seen Singapore until you have viewed it from the Infinity Pool and experienced the luxury service and bars atop Marina Bay Sands; the rooms and the views downstairs are also amazing; this place is on everyone's bucket list for a reason  ,5,
I decides to check into MBS as a treat and for some luxury after a week sailing the Thai Islands.  The check in service was ok... but I was surprised no one assisted with luggage to the room.  A late check out was requested but that's only until 12pm and I don't consider that (one extra hour!) a late check out.   I decided to spend the morning by the pool. Not once did anyone ask if I needed anything. Despite asking for a menu (eventually catching someone's eye) they never returned. So dissapointed in the lack of customer service I decided not to chase the staff and take my breakfast / lunch order elsewhere. MBS didn't deserve my custom.   I wouldn't go back or recommend this hotel as I feel there is no value for money.   ,2,
"I was in Singapore for two weeks and MBS is the most characteristic skyline of the city. Therefore, I've decided to spend my last night in Singapore at MBS. The room overlooked the Gardens by the bay, which are exceptional from above. The room was spacious and with modern decor. The infinity pool is what made me choose this hotel and with no regrets. The view from the infinity pool is great. The pool gets crowded at time but if you are patient, you'll manage to get the perfect shot of yourself with nobody around. It's possible to have snacks and drinks by the pool. The hotel is huge and check in/check out may  take a bit longer than usual (keep that in mind!). The staff tries their best and redirect people to the VIP check in if the queue gets too long. However, I did assist to…",4,

"After having been to ""The Pool"" back in 2011 for the first time in my life to celebrate a friend's birthday (they had booked a room, I was just a pool guest), I now had the opportunity to book a room at MBS myself at a special trade fair rate in October this year. What has certainly changed from back then is the rigorousness, which now strictly only allows guests in possession of a hotel card into the pool area. But obviously for the right reasons.   With respect to my stay, I'd say it depends on your personal situation but I DO find the rates there rather high and would have probably not booked the room for the regular price- nevertheless, this is also what this hotel stands for: 5* Luxury.   Through it's unusual shape (the ""surfboard"" or ""ironing board"") and the stunning views…",5,

She was rude, arrogant and dismissive towards our friend Mr Roh who assisted us in the booking and checking in of one of the rooms. Mr Roh is a very humble and appreciate person. Although he was embarrassed by the staff from Marina Bay Sands, he was still courteous towards them as he didn't want to ruin our ""big day"" for us and our guests.

Considering the amount of rooms and guests, each staff member goes out of their way to make sure you feel loved and cared for, remembering your names at the club 55 at breakfast and afternoon tea, what coffee and food we liked, everyone deserves recognition for the individual and outstanding service displayed.  As it was a special occasion…",5,
"We stayed overnight at MBS and we were truly satisfied with our experience. The deluxe room was very spacious, contrary to the other reviews that I read. The pool area was very crowded but the spectacular view (especially at night) compensated for it. With the pool experience alone I think we already got our money's worth. The express checkout is also cery convenient. Downside is there is no breakfast included in the room rate, which is a bummer considering the price we paid. Will stay again if we return to singapore.

"For price you pay for a place like this, it really does skimp on things. Everything about this hotel feels like they are just trying to get that little bit more out of you. From the placement of shops to the mini bar.   Arriving at the hotel, you're greeted with a large array of shops right in the centre of the lobby, with people just travelling through to shop and guest clustered into a fairly narrow strip. Service feels very impersonal but that's probably due to how busy the place usual is throughout the day and night. We had to run around a bit to find a bellboy to take our luggage. Depending on where you enter, check-in could be on the other side of the 400m long building.   The room itself is clean and quite nicely presented. Nothing spectacularly but it's well furnished.…",3,
"Decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands for the experience of the infinity pool on level 57 (reviewed separately) and opted for the Club room. The room itself is a great size and very nicely setup but simple. Room was located in tower 1 overlooking the bay at eye height to the Super Trees on level 7. The Club room comes with a list of inclusions of which we found access to Club 55 (level 55) to be a superb option as a dinner replacement and for breakfast. Both consisting of self serve buffet style and included drinks. The food, an amazing variety of options, lot in convenient taste sizes, were all of high quality and delicious flavor. The view from Club 55 and the pool plus the food made this an awesome stay.",4,
Stayed for 4 nights.  City view suite in Tower 3 on the 51st floor.   The room is nice.  Never informed I had the option of a butler service.   Only realised this was included when a survey arrived after check out!!!!!  The hotel is very busy and expect long lines at peak times.     The evening canapés are nice but really when they start at 5pm it makes it hard to enjoy for those have to actually work first!  Maybe consider if starting at 6pm or if 5pm is locked in extend it for another hour until 8pm.    Room service was quick and quite tasty.  Housekeeping is good.    There was work on the floor and power was cut for a number of hours one morning.  No advance warning provided.   No indication provided that a problem may occur.  Impossible to get ready to leave the room or even…,4,
"Although initially sceptical due to some average reviews and the sheer size of the complex, I ended up very pleased with my stay at the MBS and would come here again when in Singapore. As you'd expect, the first impression of the lobby is indeed vast and busy, but you can enjoy peace and quiet as soon as you go up the lifts. Furthermore, the service from all the staff I interacted with was personable and top notch, which was very impressive from a hotel this size - requests for item deliveries and room service were infinitely quicker than much smaller hotels!  The rooms are well designed and modern although arguably starting to show some wear and tear. The bathrooms are a standout and come equipped with designer amenities and more goodies than most top hotels including extra…",5,
"I'm guessing that MBS is too famous to even bother if their service isn't 5 star grade,  especially those working at the poolside. But yes, despite this, people, including me, still goes there as it is a Singapore icon. How I wish the service quality can level up. I was expecting the staffs there to be the best of the best. Lastly, I would still like to commend the housekeeping department for a job well done. Especially this chinese guy who's task is to go deliver the microwave that's for rental. He has a very friendly demeanour and is always willing to help. I forgot his name but I hope more MBS staffs can be like him.",3,
"Stunning hotel, with great rooms and fantastic views. However what is absolutely unbelievable is the tropical sky park and swimming pool spanning 3 buildings on the 57th. floor ( approx 150 meters ) where you float over the city in between palmtrees.",5,
"To get access to the infinity pool you must be staying at the hotel, so here we go. Expensive, but totally worth it. We took city view room, awesome view. The pool, wow! Super expensive for drinks, but this is Singapore, it is expensive everywhere. Only downside is the limited number of affordable restaurants, and it takes foreever to get your drinks at the pool bars.",5,
"I suppose we were the lucky ones after reading all these negative comments here. We had a wonderful, less than 24-hour stay here a couple of weeks ago before getting on a cruise. I could not imagine spending my own money staying here but fortunately we had some points on our soon-to-be-dropped credit card that could get us a room for the night at MBS. We checked in at the registration in Tower 3 and a very courteous caucasian young man helped us get everything straighten up. He upgraded both our rooms (SIL had a paid room) from deluxe to premium and I believe ours was more than a premium room. It was some kind of a corner suite with sitting area and dining area. The room had a city view and the bathroom had the garden view. The main point of staying here was the Infinity Pool,…",5,
"Huge hotel, famous with the infinity pool, the pool located at the level 57 and amazing view from there, the pool divided to adults area and family area, also you can find many jacuzzi pool located there, and you should eat the famous dish ""french fried""",5,
"Good points  1 stayed at 48th floor tower 3 the view from the hotel was spectacular.  Bad Points  1 in room dining ordered butter chicken for $30 and it was nowhere near to a 5 star hotel food. When complained the staff said we aren't the experts. Basically it was ""eat what's available"" whereas at hotels like these you expect to indulge into chefs creativity   2 Good size buffet but nothing fancy about it!  The items were there but just for the heck of it! None of the dish had the yum factor in it   3 ordered beer along fries in the pool. $12 fries 😳 and the quantity is soo much that you will die eating but will not be able to finish the fries. So basically it didn't fall neither in nibblers category not it justified the price. It would been better to half the qty and charge…",3,
The view is awesome both in the day and at night. Lotsa cable channels to watch at night. Just puzzling that the housekeeping didn't detect weird smell coming from the bed pillows. Didn't bother to ask for a change as it was late. We just dump it at the sofa. Overall will stay here for the views but hope that we won't have to encounter the weird pillow smell again.,3,
"It was the second time to stay this hotel and the last was in June. I have used three hotels in Singapore and I want to rank this hotel in the middle of them. The hotel has a great pool in the roof and many people in the world want to enjoy it. And travelers can appreciate amazing night view of Singapore even in the hotel room. Also, very close to Gardens by the Bay and Flyer. If it is the first time to visit Singapore and if travelers are in good financial condition, I would like to recommend staying this hotel at least one night. But, I think the hotel is not so competitive. Other two hotels have higher cost-effectiveness than Marina Bay Sands based on my experience. Whenever I visit Marina Bay Sands, I felt some inconveniences in check-in because there are too many people…",3,
"Slow check in process, with many mistakes, they didn't activate our door cards properly, had us move rooms mid our stay and the line for customer service was huge, all the time. Probably because of all the constant mistakes. The staff all seem to have terrible attitudes. You should be able to ask a reasonable question without getting the run around.  The views from this hotel are amazing but I've had much better service in Melbourne from 4 star hotels, better run and better organised for their customers than this Hotel.  The room was large, nicely set out and comfortable.  The minibar was one of those annoying charge you if you make the mistake of moving anything automated system things. So you can't store milk for your tea because there is no space.  There is always a massive…",1,
"I stayed there for 2 nights and what an experience. The pool! The view! You cannot visit this hotel without going up! The infinity pool was a ""wow"". My daughter enjoyed it so much! The room was massive and bathroom was huge too. ",5,
"The infinity pool was amazing, but it is not like in the pictures. It is super crowded even from the early morning and it is difficult to find a place to seat. The views from the pool and the rooms are very nice, but everything else is overrated. Plus, you pay 400 euros for a double room and you don't get even breakfast!",3,
The hotel is too big to manage I think.  I was going to get into the infinite pool but the doorman told me I need to ACTIVATE my key card which is on the 1st floor. So I had to go downstairs to activate my card and than go back to 57th floor. Which was very unpleasant experience. ,3,
"Had always dreamt of visiting so when I found out non residents could pay to go on the observation deck i thought, yes please.  We had been on a cruise and docked at 9am so had the day in Singapore.  We toured the gardens at the bay then made our way to the marina bay sands hotel.  Thought we could sit on the top and enjoy lunch.  Not so.  We paid I think 23 or so US dollars each, went to the top.  It was very quiet, enjoyed the views then tried to find somewhere to sit.  Not one seat!  Could not enter restaurant as non resident. Snack bar also had no seating.  Quite a few people were sitting on the floor! I would never have managed to get down, let alone up again without some embarrassment also, I had light coloured trousers and had a long journey ahead. Took the shine off my…",3,
"Amazing hotel, world class but very busy in the weekends. Took us hours before we were able to check in. But the service is great. The complimentary coffee is Nespresso. The pool is awesome though they give only two keys for the infinity pool despite being in a family room. You have to pay for the extra pool key.",4,
"Stayed in a city-view club room for two nights and it was a wonderful experience. The room was spacious and offered spectacular views of marina bay and the city skyline. Enjoyed access to Level 55 which offered an impressive cocktail spread with a free flow of champagne and wine plus an amazing ocean view. The breakfast selection at Level 55 was also impressive with artisanal yoghurt, cheeses and a good selection of meats and pastry. To burn off all the calories there is a well equipped gym with a great view and of course the infinity pool. Will definitely be back for another staycation!",5,
"Check in - Very fast check in service, they even moved us into VIP check in to keep queues down. Although there was only 5 in the queue. 10/10   Room - In tower 3, 45 Floors up the room was spectacular. We overlooked the gardens which I would highly recommend. The gardens light up at night so good sight over a drink. The service was brilliant with guest services on the phone if required. (only down point is if you require fresh milk for tea/coffee you are charged - 5* Hotel? 9/10   Hotel is a large maze to walk around, with direct link into the shopping centre which houses the casino and high end market shops. You can easily walk into the bay and connect to the train if required   Large amount of restaurants to choose dinner from, however we preferred to walk into the shopping…",5,
"Have been in this hotel few times and decided to book once again after receiving newsletter with their festive prices ad. Made reservation all ok on best fare found,received confirmation email. Phoned agent day after to continue purchasing and arranging further for my trip. A WEEK after Marina Bay Sands reservation confirmation I get email from them asking me to pay over 2000S$ more or they gonna cancel my reservation! They said they had problem with their booking system website and even if I got it all confirmed they will still have to cancel!!!! Of I pay over 2000S$ they will let me keep my reservation.  As a sorry for their system malfunctions they offered me 100S$ reduction on my final bill! 100S$!!! <-- :D  So.. I have to say this huge company just don't care as they so big…",1,
"To say that this hotel is massive is an understatement!   We had a fantastically large room on the 41st floor with amazing views over the bay to marvel at. Quite to my surprise, despite the scale of the hotel, there are personal touches, but when in public areas, such as the lobby or the worlds largest rim flow pool, you can feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of people. ",4,
"This hotel is amazing! And the views are spectacular. Although it is one of the more expensive places to stay in Singapore, it is worth every penny. Plus, you can't use their iconic pool unless you're a hotel guest.. and that alone is a reason to stay here. Below the hotel, there is a large shopping mall with mostly upscale stores but there are some moderately priced stores as well. There's also a decent food court connected to the mall that has many different international options. The rooms are very nice and offer lots of space, large bathroom, and ample patio space with great views. Comfy beds which you would expect. Additionally, the gardens are so beautiful! We went in December, so everything was all lit up and decorated for the holidays. Made us feel right at home. Would…",5,
"A lot has been said about this hotel in previous reviews. If you're not staying there a good way to see the pool deck and the views is to go for an evening drink at the bar at the top. I think it was a Spago's. Naturally not cheap, like nothing is in Singapore, but absolutely worth it.",5,
"The place is amazing, don't get me wrong. Definitely something to experience once in a lifetime. Nice rooms, nice pool, extreme luxury. That being said, extremely overpriced considering nothing is included in that price, not even breakfast.",4,
"Staycation for a couple of nights. 3 rooms. Been 2 years since I last visited. Service still top notch. View spectacular as usual. They finally have a decent workaround for the fridge. And for the first time, we had late checkout (tho it's 12noon). It's however difficult to get connecting rooms. Nothing is confirmed even up til the check-in counter.",5,
The garden view from our Premier room was absolutely fantastic as was our generous sized room. I stayed at the hotel to fulfill my fantasy of being in the Infinity Pool on the very top of the architecturally stunning building at level 57. I visited the area but with the crowds in the pool I just didn't feel like going in to bounce about with everyone. I wanted to swim which I understand is a bit different! Nevertheless I took many photos as the Infinity Pool is really a jaw dropper and you just HAVE to see it. Unforgettable view and vision of water in the pool ending and spilling over the very top of the building.   The crowds down lower in the hotel entry level were enormous too. I found it off-putting as if on a shopping mall or very public area rather than a hotel check I…,4,
"The sky infinity pool is one of the greatest highlights of this resort! Pool side foods are delish, especially when you're enjoying a spectacular view of the city!   Another great perk is that this hotel is connected to the Gardens By The Bay by a bridge inbuilt into the hotel which gives you the easiest and most convenient access to the incredible gardens day and night!   Buffet breakfast was YUMMM and the casino in the hotel was fun as ever! Felt like we were at vegas! A really great anniversary trip and stay at this resort! Staff are so friendly and the rooms are well kept and so soooo beautiful!   Love this place and cannot wait to come back! ",5,
Me and my cousin stayed there during our vacation in Singapore and i can say that the money spent was all worth it. The room is clean and spacious. The people working there are very accommodating and polite. Joanna and Antonio from the reception service are very well mannered and kind during our check in. The view from the hotel is very nice....,5,
"A five day stay at Marina Bay Sands was the culmination of our Thailand-Cambodia-Singapore family tour. The breathtaking view from the 53rd floor was awesome but our stay was spoiled by 2 things. The first is the non-aircon lift. It was a continuous ordeal enduring dead air especially when the elevator was full with everyone competing for precious oxygen. The other thing is the SECURITY AUNTIE FROM HELL. On our last night, a long-time friend residing in SG visited us when we were stopped at elevator entrance. I actually had 2 access cards but I was honest enough to tell auntur that my friend is a visitor. She required us to register. The counter at Tower 3 was closed so we had to walk all the way to Tower 1. The lady at the counter told us that visitors can't use the pool. I…",3,
"The light show at 9pm was amazing, then went up to roof baro look over the city - so spectacular. Very expensive as they charge 20 Sing Dollars to ascend - you then can spend in the bar....gets you one beer! Worth it for the view though!",4,
"A beautiful iconic hotel, set along the waterfront, with a stunning backdrop of two of Singapore's signature attractions: Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer (large ferries wheel).   The SkyPark is the star attraction of the hotel as it sits atop all three of the hotel's 50++ floor towers. Plus, the infinity pool along the top of the SkyPark is majestic as it encompasses nearly half of the rooftop. It's as if you are swimming in the sky, overlooking the cityscape of one of the most prestigious cities in the world.  Although the hotel is a little pricey for the average traveler, it was a superb location for our honeymoon.  We hope to spend our anniversary there in the future. The hotel staff were very accommodating and quick to provide whatever we asked.   The opulence is…",5,
"Thank you Richard from the In room dining , we been here since 2015 the last time. Always feel like my home, we will visit again, delicious food, express service and comfort bed. They have so much place to enjoy your lunch and dinner. Choose one of the celebrity restaurant to get your experience. ",5,
"We booked one night just to enjoy the pool - and it was all worth it. We were offered a free upgrade - an amazing 35th floor view- and the room was great. But the pool.... I can saw it was an amazing day. To be surrounded by palm trees at the 57th floor, to sit in the hot tub and look at the Gardens - it was the most relaxing day possible.  I recommend this experience!",5,
"We have all seen or heard of the infinity pool looking over Singapore. It is an exorbitant bucket list for sure but a bucket list. Unfortunately, we were here for the weekend which meant higher prices. However, the hotel was beautiful. We had the garden view so we watched the light show of the Garden of the Bay from the room. Rooms were great and clean. 2 free water. Key card must present to access infinity pool which is open from 0600-2300. Definitely check it out right after check in and before checkout. The day and night view is very different but very beautiful. It rained during our swim but only for 20 min and everyone waited it out. Also, professional photographer will take photos but definitely overpriced. Free towels by the pool as well. Have fun!",5,
I booked a Grand Club room (Garden view) for a 3 nights staycation with my family. The room was lovely and huge with a separate living area and even a dining table for 6. The room was located in a quiet corner of the level and I really liked this as I did not have to worry about turning down the volume of the TV. I was also not disturbed by noises along the corridor outside the room as the sleeping area of the room was inaccessible and cordoned off with a glass panel. I had a very good and quiet rest. There is a huge balcony in my room that can be accessed from 2 glass sliding doors in the sleeping and living area. I had a lovely view of the Gardens By the Bay and the harbour from my room. Please note that only Garden View rooms come with balcony. City view rooms come with…,4,
Stayed here for 3 days. Guests of the hotel have free access to the sky park (I think that's what's it's called) where you can see the awesome view of the downtown area. Access to the infamous infinity pool is exclusive for hotel guests. Each guest must have their own key in order to enter the pool area. The hotel is very accessible via MRT. ,5,
"Amazing hotel in one of the best locations in Singapore.  Caters to anything you need from one of the best spa chains in the world (Banyan tree) to a casino, theater, shops and restaurants below. The club room with Marina Bay views was spacious and modern and what a view! The restaurants has a good variety of food to choose from and the roof top dining options have an amazing views over Singapore. The roof top pool is probably the best feature of hotel but is almost always completely packed and hard to find a deck chair or even a spot in the pool that you don't feel like your not invading someone's space (or ruining their selfies).  We went to the pool at sunrise and it was such a cool experience - firstly there was hardly anyone in the pool so you had so much space to actually…",5,
"Yes, it has spectacular city view from the infinity pool on the top, but in reality this pool is much smaller e much crowded as it seems in photos. For the rest, it is to much huge place, you have impression to be in very big shopping mall, no familiar approach.. too much crawded, queue everywhere. It looks spectacular by night",4,
"The rooms are clean and modern - something you would see in North America in a 3-4 star hotel. We did reserve this hotel because of the pool and its views. It truly is the only thing that makes this hotel stand out. We went to the pool in the morning  and we were disappointed with the lack of a breakfast menu. 2 cappuccinos (did not taste good), yogurt & granola, and 3 small muffins cost 30$ SGD. If you are paying for that little - you would think it would be top notch - but we were sadly mistaken. Front staff are more like clerks at a store than a high-end hotel. Responses are cut and dry - they figured they have so many guests that they forget customer service.   On another note -The taxi ride from the airport costs 20-25 $SGD one way (inclusive of traffic). The hotel is…",3,
"So it depends on what your hotel palate is like. There wasn't a single thing I could find wrong with the Marina Bay Sands - but there will always be a lot of people around but it was always efficiently run while I stayed. It's almost more of a small city than a hotel - I think they have about 2500 rooms over the three towers, and there are frequent tours and just walk through visitors going through the lobby. If your preference is for a small boutique hotel where the staff remember your name - this isn't it. Having said that the staff always went out of their way to be friendly, communicative and the service was top notch during my entire stay. For example I was standing in the queue for the concierge desk to ask about the local sights and there wasn't anyone waiting at the VIP…",5,

"If you plan to book a room at this hotel, you should definitely get familiar with the Terms and Conditions - you should really read them through.   For example, even if you get booking confirmation from the hotel, it doesn't mean your booking is ok. There is very low age limit for the children (of 12 yrs!) and that limit is mentioned only in the T&C when making a booking. If you have older children, your booking goes through the system BUT you will be asked later to book another room as the only way to have the once confirmed accommodation.  In addition, it's the same with the pool access. It's clearly said that only hotel guests can access the pool - but there are access restrictions which are, once again hidden in the T&C! Even if you are hotel guest, you might not have the…",1,
We rode a hop on hop off thru the city of Singapore.  A great way to see the city when time is limited.  We decided to go up to the top if Marina Bay Sands.  It didn't disappoint.  Great views even with an overcast.  The price was high $40 Singapore dollars and could only be used one time.  The city is worth your time.  It is clean and the architecture alone is worth seeing.,5,
"The view from the pool is of course spectacular but overall the rest of the experience feels very overpriced. Checkin was crowded, slow and stressful- not the welcome you want! Because the hotel is so big you spend a lot of time waiting; waiting to be given a table at breakfast (20 min wait one morning), waiting for the lift to arrive, waiting for bar staff, waiting for a pool lounger to become available, you get the idea! Overall I'm pleased we stayed so that we could swim in the pool but I wouldn't go back, and I wouldn't say it's worth the expensive of staying longer than a night or two. ",3,
If you stay here expecting great service and attention you must go to some other close by 5 star property which is smaller. This property has close to 2500 rooms and The hotel itself is one of the major tourist attractions in singapore which makes the area around the hotel very crowded. Hence detailed attention towards guest is something that's impossible. Never the less we had no issue whilst interacting with any of the staff neither did we come any one rude or non cooperative.  The beauty of the hotel and the only reason I would stay here again is the roof top infinity pool. It's one in a kind and enough fun to make you come back again and again. The casino and the huge mall connected to the hotel are a bonus. Breakfast is wonderful with multiple venue options. Club lounge is…,4,
"Of course everyone knows the infinity pool, and yes, everyone in the pool is taking pictures but it is worth every penny to be there.  The service is amazing, the rooms are super spacious and comfy, the shower is a delight, and the view is just everything! People who don't stay cannot go into the pool and must either pay for the restaurants that have a view of the pool or pay for the balcony to take pictures. I would stay here if I went back to Singapore!",5,
"Stayed overnight in November, front desk had a system upgraded causing delay checkin, only managed to check into room at 5pm. At checkout, bill was incorrectly invoiced, front desk 'fixed' it however 3 weeks later when I'm back home I found my credit card was still charged incorrectly.  Trying to find a wrong to contact the hotel, no email is listed.. Disappointing experience.",1,
We have just had the most amazing trip to Indonesia and decided to finish off at MBS.  Best decision ever.  We upgraded to the club room which again was a cracking decision.  With breakfast included and the canapés in the evening where just lush.  The views from our room (gardens of the bay) where brilliant and I thought I'd messed up as I wanted a city view but....... city view has no balcony.  As for the pool. Well if you can get over the selfie stick brigade it's just awesome. Although I must say we took just as many pics as everyone else.  Staff where brilliant so attentive.   The only issue is the check in took nearly 1hr. It's like checking in at the airport. But I guess with 2600 rooms what else can you expect.  On the whole it was an amazing experience. ,5,
"A vast hotel in which one can already get lost times between shoppers mall and the garden. The hotel is very well maintained and my room at the 41st floor in Tower 1 was very comfortable. A fantastic bathroom and a superlative view over the city. A special highlight was the morning swim in the Infinity Pool. The best time is during the check-out time between 11-14am. To be honest the menu at the pool could be extended. To the magical sunset hour is also recommended, but the pool is then quite crowded. As a guest you get also access to the Observation Deck. It should be said that it is probably one of the most expensive areas of Singapore. So go out and explore the city and see other areas. Otherwise the MBS offers a lot of entertainment in the direct environment. I had a great…",4,
"Total luxury! Well organised big hotel with awsome shopping mall and wonderful restaurants, and ofcourse the rooftop infinity pool! Spectacular!!  And one bonus is that the hotel has a ""visitor"" area in the side of the rooftop for fotos and view so it's a bit more private in the pool/hotel area",5,
"I was in this hotel in march 2016. I think it is the best hotel for relax. Marina bay sands is like attraction for Singapore. If you will be in Singapore you should visited this place. Service in this hotel is amazing. This hotel has many restaurant, but you can go to 57 floor and relax in swimming pool. At night you can see laser show, and walk to marina bay gardens it is 8 world wonders. Have a nice travel!",5,
"If you want a hotel that feels like a sprawling resort all wrapped up into one, then the Marina Bay Sands is for you. Can't fault the room,the service, the wifi or the food. Everything super efficient. The view from the restaurant at the top is extraordinary - especially spectacular at night but a little breezy first thing in the morning! The hotel is attached to the casino and convention centre, a selection of shops under one roof that makes Beverly Hills look like a discount centre, theatres and a science museum. However, there is a constant stream of humanity through the lobby, which makes it feel more like a first world bus station than iconic hotel. I had a room on the 14th floor but could still hear the traffic. I'm glad I stayed but I won't be going back.",3,
"We just checked in here in marina bay sands, a bit late coz we went around the city, we arrived here early but the check in time was at 3pm. We will be staying here for 2 days, 2nd time. The first time, Vincent gave us a room at 34th floor and with really good view. He's the best! Was excited to come back but this time they gave us a room at 2nd floor, no view, just beside the road and it's noisy, you will actually see and hear the people in the lobby area. Also, pillows smells weird. The view at the pool is really amazing, very good view. Location is perfect, you can use train to go around the city and it's near the gardens by the bay, walking distance to merlion, thumbs up for location. just try to get a room at higher level.",4,
"Have just checked out of the Marina Bay Sands after an amazing 3 night stay.  After reading other reviews I was concerned that we would be 'one of a number' and be staying in this huge mass market product with little attention to detail.  How wrong I was.... from the moment we checked in every member staff (regardless of where they worked within the hotel) was courteous and went above and beyond.  We had booked the Grand Club Room - wow we were not disappointed.  Super comfortable bed, huge room and bathroom, free standing bath, his and hers sinks, beautiful toiletries.  Great maid service and complimentary bottles of water placed in the room each day.  We had access to the lounge, Club 55, and this really made our stay even more special.  Breakfast was one of the best I have…",5,
Probably the best night I ever had in a hotel.  The rooms were big and confortable. The service was quick and very welcoming. The swimming pool just took my breath away ! Perfect view on the city with refreshing cocktails!,5,
"One of the highlights of the hotel was its infinity pool over looking Singapore city. Really enjoyed the view and the breeze.   The rooms are of a decent size but needs a makeover.  Service was great from the FO, F&B and especially Avan Chew from Guest Services. Very friendly and pleasant to talk to him.   Overall was a good hotel, will come again",4,
Despite how expensive it was to stay here it was totally worth it..we were upgraded to a Bay view room on the 48th floor and it was just fantastic..And that pool is to die for except it is freezing cold! Drinks and food at the pool are very expensive but the pool staff is very friendly. In any case just loved it....only stayed 2 nights and definitely could have stayed more...We did not get breakfast with our room so cannot comment but we did eat at a little sandwich place in the lobby and it was delicious and reasonably priced unlike all the other restaurants in the hotel! So glad I had the opportunity to stay at this amazing hotel! 😊,5,
"I have nothing to say about the service, check in was impeccable i was fortunate to be offered a small upgrade, gratefully accepted! It was my girlfriends birthday and the hotel delivered a delicious cake to us which was a very nice gesture. The room was fabulous the most comfortable bed of the holiday by far. I have two points which bring the review to a 4 Star. 1. Maybe it was my oversight, But having checked in after a intra-region flight at about 6pm and checkout being 11am, the following day (a worrying trend among hotels around the world) I clearly mistakenly assumed we would be able to use the pool during the daytime, and then have a shower in the changing rooms pick our bags up from reception and go to the airport.  So even though I was a hotel guest because I checked…",4,
"Marina Bay Sands or MBS has already become the icon of Singapore, which the young all the way to the old will know about it. Situated within the Downtown Core, MBS allow guests to conveniently explore the various places of interest within the location.  Personally, I only have praises and nothing but praises for MBS. From my own experience, it is better to book your room early to prevent from any disappointment.",5,
"The pool, the pool, the pool. Let's face it. We've all seen it on Instagram and well, it's a splurge... but worth it. Check in, hit the pool, and enjoy.  Oh, and one other thing. When you first enter your room, drop your key card in the slot, and prepare for a most impressive welcome. (I won't ruin the surprise)",5,
"Wow...Wow! This place is amazing. I'm sure there's tones of posts already so I won't bang on. We booked a Club Room so we had access to the lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks. We usually go exploring during the day, but our room was so amazing we spent the day inside the hotel!!",5,
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands is akin to staying at an expensive hotel on the Vegas strip, complete with the ridiculous check-in waits. Getting past that, the hotel truly has every last feature in place for comfort and enjoyment and the rooftop infinity pool is one of my favourite locations in all of Asia. A genuine 5 star luxury experience.",5,
"This is our second time returning back to Marina Bay Sands only a year later.  The first time we were amazed and in love with our room.  We booked the same type of room (Premier room) this past trip but it was definitely ALOT smaller than our first stay and the view definitely wasn't quite as good.  Also, at check-in I didn't feel real welcome as I did our first stay.  Nothing was even said about it being a second time here.  Our room was clean.  Luggage is delivered quickly.  Room service was really pretty slow.  We really enjoyed the light and music show outside the hotel in the evening.  It was a highlight.  We mostly stay here to use the pool and enjoy the great view from the pool.  However, the pool was incredibly chilly and I couldn't really enjoy myself and neither could…",3,
"On 31st Floor, fantastic view, Everything you need at hand. Room bigger than home lounge. Huge bed, room cleaned every day, fresh towels, sheets etc.every day. Breakfast included too much to choose from, Continental, English, Chinese, Malay, we even tried Bread and Butter pudding made with Brioche and Vanilla cream just to try it out, fantastic.",5,
"We had such a nice stay at Marina Bay Sands after 10 days in Bali. 3 nights with a city view club room was amazing and we don't regret it for a second. The pool was great and we got beds every time with no problems at all. The water was a little bit cold, but I'm sure that was nice for some people. The breakfast at Club 55 was amazing! I could literally have sat there for hours if it didn't close at 11. People were so friendly and helpful, we only thought it took a little bit too long to do the check in and out. Said before we left home that this was a once in a life experience to stay at this hotel, but I would definitely try to come back.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is one of the best integrated resorts in Singapore. The resort has 2561 rooms.This was officially  opened on 17th February 2011. I stayed there from 30th November to 4th December,2016. This is three Tower 55 storey hotel and I stayed there on bay facing 31st floor of 3rd Tower.The room is spacious and three person can stay.Bay side view was excellent. A canal runs through the length of the shoppes.Its huge and difficult to track places.I lost my way three times. Staffs are very good. But the   complimentary breakfast they offer was worst.Well connected with the rest part of city by Metro and road.",4,
"This is my second time back to the hotel. We planned to celebrate our parent's 44th wedding anniversary here. Check-in was rather smooth and fast. A bit disappointed with the size of the room this time, it was smaller than expected and without a bathtub which was such a let down. Newspapers and shaver (not for me) were upon request only. The air-conditioning had a disturbing noise in our room (4310). And if only there was a bidet in the toilet.   Oh well...on a brighter note, the room was clean and pleasant with a very nice view overlooking the Gardens and OCBC Skyway. On the second night of our stay, we came back from shopping and were surprised to find some simple ""origami"" decoration made up of flower petals and twisted towels in my parent's room. We were hoping for something…",4,
"This is a very amazing place, if you stay around Boat Quay or Chinatown area and don't mind to take a long walk, I would suggest you to start walking from Merlion statue and walk along the riverside, it will take you around 30mins to reach Marina Bay Sands but you basically won't notice the time because that are too many things to see along the riverside. You can enjoy the city sightings from various angles. There are also many people jogging, cycling along the riverside which is a very cool place too. Recommend to go there after 4:30pm and enjoy the sunset and evening city view.",4,
Best choice of Hotel to stay in Singapore. Very good service with friendly staves. Great location to do shopping and hang out. Wonderful and enless view of Singapore from the Swiming pool on the Top Floor. Really valued for money.,5,
"We stayed here for 2 nights and those two nights were the best. The hotel is very classy, comfortable and has high regards for their guests. The check-in process was so convenient and hassle free. Kudos to their front desk officer, Joanne, who made us feel valued and welcomed. She has been so patient in answering our queries. She even explained the details of what we can look forward to our stay. She gave us the best impression of the hotel's excellent customer  service. She even called us in the room and asked if we liked the room. The room is quite big you'll have enough space for the luggages and for u to walk around. The view was amazing! Especially at night where, btw, we had a city view room. The infinity pool was a ""wow"" my daughter enjoyed it so much. There was an…",5,
So where to start  As a regular visitor to Singapore over the years I recall seeing the MBS being built in 2008 for the first time .  So operating for some time now I decided to give it a try   First thoughts upon entering / utter chaos / and the ugliest checkin counter I have ever seen   The building from the outside is stunning and Singapores Sydney Opera House it dominates the landscape  So filled with expectation in I go   My god such appalling interior design gaudy lacking both aesthetic appeal and then poor build quality   To be honest it's just too big too many people and bad design So staying in 4392 suite at a very high cost I will add I have access to the club lounge on level 55   But that's in tower 2 isn't it I'm in tower 1  So rather than have an interconnector I…,3,
Room was very spacious and with beautiful views of the gardens.  The pool was amazing and it was great relaxing there all day. Night views were also very nice and not to be missed.  Will go back again :),5,
"Pros: The infinity pool was excellent, they provide towels and it was not crowded. Music at the pool is not too loud and people actually behave. The room was excellent, clean and with very nice views. Luggage was picked-up and quickly delivered in our room.  Cons: Check-in experience was terrible, they had a new system in place and it took us at least one hour to get to the counter. In addition, we didn't even have a room available at first (and it was already check-in time). There is an additional tax to the room which makes it even more expensive when it doesn't even include breakfast. The staff at the pool was extremely slow, after 20min of ordering drinks they told us that they had issues with our credit card (when it was perfectly working), also, you can't charge them under…",4,
"What a famous hotel!! A unique and really impressive. I stay one night in 43th floor with a suberb view of the gardens by the bay!! The room was great, spacious and with a great view. Staff are kind and accommodating. The whole complex includes a big mall, with top stors, like Gucci, Prada, Chanel and a LV store that you have to visit. A realy nice food court and a pool at the top of the hotel (the one that looks like a ship being held by the 3 towers) with breathtaking view. Infinity Pool. Location is great as well, taking into account that you can ago anywhere by MRT, which is really cheap. The gardens in front of the hotel are also an experience. I'll be back!",5,
"I stayed in this place recently. All was perfect and I would recommend this place to anyone who is willing to pay for the luxury, with the exception of a couple of things. First, we booked this place directly on their website and received an email confirmation right away. When time drew near, we were unable to find in the email any indication that our booking included a brunch for two. We went to check on the website and the webpage was no longer available. We had to call the hotel to confirm that our package indeed included a brunch. Second, at the time of checkout, the counter agent gave us a bill that added additional charges for the brunch for two. It was corrected only after we asked her to check our booking record. We wish they had included the email confirmation of our…",4,
"The most iconic hotel to stay in Singapore. It has all the qualities of a 5 star hotel, but the problem is that is so huge, and there are so many people that it feels like a theme park. Imagine the big casino hotels in Macau; this is how it feels. There is also a casino at the bottom, and it is connected to a big and nice mall. So if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not the place. Even the iconic infinity pool at the rooftop is full of people, unless you swim very early, but fantastic views at the top. There are also many restaurants to have breakfast with very high quality buffet food. The most quiet is actually at the rooftop pool. It is also damn expensive so maybe you stay one night for the experience, and go somewhere else cheaper.",4,
"This place is very beautiful. You can see the Singapore central business district at one glance. Tall skyscrapers of leading banks can be seen in the background. It is also a place where people exercise and jog after office hours. It is also dotted with many cafes, pubs and eateries with many cuisines to choose from. This place is easily accessible by MRT train. I highly recommend to drop by to absorb the cosmopolitan atmosphere. If you walk to the opposite site you can see the famous Merlion and the Merlion park. There is also the Helix bridge and the Youth Olympic Park.",4,
"I spent 2 nights here & totally loved the experience of the pool, spa, luxury items in my room & my room! Biggest bathroom ever & views were amazing. The shops & restaurants were fab-even a food hall with cheap Asian dishes...yummy! ",5,
"This is a famous hotel featuring a unique and really impressive design. The room was great, spacious and with a great view to the sea. Staff are kind and accommodating. The whole complex includes a mall, food court and a pool at the top of the hotel (the one that looks like a ship being held by the 3 towers) with breathtaking view. The food was great. Location is great as well, taking into account that you can ago anywhere by taxi, which is really cheap. The gardens in front of the hotel are also an experience. In general it is highly recommended.",5,
"We booked this hotel for 1 night before embarking on our cruise from Singapore. What a disappointment as parties were being held in rooms all night which made sleeping impossible. Having raised the issue with staff, we were quickly dismissed as if that's a normal situation.",2,
"We stayed in the Hospitality Suite late Nov for five days. The suite was great and quite spacious, sufficient for five of us: three adults, two children (5 and 1 yr old).  The overall experience was great to the extent we will be back again.  A few positives: - Great location - Very efficient and customer focused, in spite of hotel size and its occupancy rate (98% of the rooms occupied) - Very friendly and great personal service, e.g. complementary fruit plate, cleaners made interesting shapes made with towels (dog, dove, etc.) - Fantastic view  - being like a city with a lot to offer and discover - Good restaurants  A few negatives: - The lobby is like a shopping mall with lots of people - Our suite was on L2 and could hear the road and lobby noise",5,
"This hotel was booked on my birthday for one night. We were queuing for checkin for 25 minutes. The receptionist did not even notice that it was my birthday. At time of booking a few months earlier, I was promised a birthday surprise. But there was no reaction after asking what my promised birthday surprise was at reception. The pool area is very small and uncomfortable. There is an ongoing movement of guests and of waiters, constantly asking for orders. This hotel is by far overrated and way too expensive. ",2,
"My friends and I stayed here for a couple of nights and had a wonderful experience. The infinity pool is worth the hype, however it does tend to get noisy and boisterous on weekends with the general crowd pouring into Ce La Vie",5,
"The quality of the bathrooms is how I judge a hotel's standard. In my stay at the MBS the bathroom was definitely my favourite so far... The staff are really friendly as what you would expect for the price you're paying. However, I noticed some wear and tear in the finer details of the hotel (eg elevator wallpaper).",5,
"Stayed here for 5 nights, expected so much, but left disappointed. I travel to Singapore every month but this was the first time here. I brought my wife with me as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.   The good .......the room, the view, the pool.  The bad .....service at the level 57 restaurants and Bars is terrible, a 15 minute wait for drinks after ordering them!  Then there was the food poisoning!!! From a hotel restaurant on level 57 food consumed the night before our wedding anniversary. Made for a memorable but not so enjoyable anniversary. There were other service flaws e.g. Taking a booking for a restaurant that was closed for a private function, and not telling me was an example of many of these!!! Let's not mention the instant coffee in the room.  A lesson…",2,
"Quite visually spectacular, service fantastic, but don't think the brand shops in the attached malls will be reasonable - that's why they are exclusive.   Still it is an unique experience to swim in the infinity pool at floor 57 overlooking the city; even if u do it only once. All rather surreal really!  ",5,
"This was probably the biggest waste of money on my SE Asia trip.  The hotel is huge, reminded me of the casinos in Vegas, with 15 employees at the check in counter and a line out the door of guests trying to check in en masse.  The room was clean and comfortable, staff was accommodating and friendly.  The selling point of this property is its pool and it was possibly the worst part of the entire place.  It was full to the brim with people jostling to get the best selfie angle.  I have never seen so many phones and selfie sticks in a pool.  When I finally found an open lounge chair, I sat there in awe of how incredibly silly these people looked, had no desire to get in that pool.  So we thought, maybe if we come up first thing in the morning?  Showed up at 7:00 AM - same story. …",2,
Please ensure you check ur booking confirmation to ensure that it states all inclusions. When u arrive they won't honour anything (such as breakfast) that isn't written specifically on ur booking confirmation). ,3,
Stayed for 2 nights. Complimentary stay. Beautiful. Room was huge. Amazing view of marina bay area. Had club access. Cheap toiletries. Bath towels were tiny.   Requested for baby for bedding to be changed as my baby had an accident. Did not turn up after a few hours. Requested again and house keeping appeared shortly. Bedding was changed promptly.   Requested for later check out. Due to nap time / appointments etc. Was denied. Sounded as though they didn't even bother to check. Was immediately informed that check out was 11am. Hotel was on full occupancy. We already had requested a late checkout till 12 noon. But the staff did not appear to know about it. Wondering if there's a system of guest profiles and requests etc. Maybe it's not being utilised by staff.   Mini bar is fully…,3,
"My friends and I had an absolutely wonderful time staying here.  The facilities, amenities, and staff are excellent.  There is so many nice restaurants and stores (if you can afford it).  The infinity pool is the best part because the view is fantastic.",5,
Stayed here for two nights. We were in tower three on the 9th floor. The room was ok but not special . We chose it for the pool facilities on the top floor which were fantastic with spectacular views across the city. The ground floor which links all three towers is so busy it is like an airport! There is a huge shopping Mall attached to the hotel which has every shop imaginable. And also a casino which I did not visit.  Whilst the general check in and concierge area are a disappointment because they are so incredibly busy the bars and restaurants on the top floor were amazing and the food was excellent. So a mixed review. If i had my time again I would not stay here because it is so busy and big but would definitely use the restaurant and bars on the top floor for the best views…,3,
We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a couple of nights on the way home from our trip. It is 100% worth every dollar to sit in the infinity pool on sunset with a cocktail in your hand to watch the city light up. Nothing in the world beats the feeling I had when I experienced this! I would highly recommend adding this to your bucket list. ,5,
very well appointed rooms with small kitchenette. highly well placed and located. near seaside approachable by both taxi and metro system of Singapore. Shopping malls nearby and eating joints are added features.,4,
"Had a brilliant time, location and views from hotel are amazing day and night .Had food in restaurant by pool service and food excellent. The infinity pool is a must very impressive and our bedroom was great . The only thing letting it down was having to queue 15-20 mins to book in  and staff at desk even though friendly uniforms look tired not what I would expect. Is definitely worth avstay.",4,
"I am lucky that i have the promotion from my friend , so i got the good deal . It is fabulous hotel with spacious room and decent service . I definetly stay there again. If you want to have a good deal there , contact me :)",5,
"It was our 3rd stay at MBS. The check-in was very fast, less 10 minutes. The service at front-desk was very good. Our room was big enough, very clean. We had a bay-view room.   The pool is really gorgeous. Hopefully we'll come back sometimes.",5,
The reason I stayed in this hotel is because of the infinity pool. The hotel bedroom itself is not really grand considering you pay more than S $400. The bathroom doesn't have a bathtub it only has a shower and a toilet considering the amount I paid unless maybe if you pay more. The good thing is I get a good view of Garden by the Bay  from my bedroom which is beautiful. The other good thing is you don't have to pay to go to the observation deck if you're a hotel guest. But in terms of value for money  I think this hotel it's not really value for money.,4,
"5 star service from Marina Bay Sand Hotel Staff named Diane at the check in counter. This is my first time visited &stayed at MBS Hotel ,had many enquiries about directions asked to Diane.  Diane answerd my enquiries in a very professional manner and accurately. Keep up the good work! ",5,
"We stayed in this hotel on our last night in Singapore.  We were not disappointed. We were checked-in early and got room upgrade.  Our room has a nice view of the bay and big enough for my family and I.  Of course the Skypark is a good bonus as we get to enjoy the cold water of the pool with the Singapore skyline in the background.  The breakfast at Rise Restaurant is also superb and the resto staff, mostly our Kababayans were very accommodating and friendly.  The pricey stay was compensated with the wonderful view, nice night swim and hearty breakfast.",5,
"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for four nights. It was meant to be a stopover that ended up being a destination.   First off , the view from the infinity pool is stunning. We had plans to go sightsee, but never seemed to leave the hotel.   The rooms are excellent. My wife enjoyed the shopping. We loved the restaurants.   You must stay at this hotel. But if you go with a different one, stay there first and then go here. We had a quick layover at the airport coming home, so it was hard to justify a ten hour layover in the sands. It was a big disappointment. Now my family is extremely spoiled. ",5,
"A long queue to check in & it took 45 mins to get us checked in . I have sent an email to them since August 2016 to let them know that we will travel as honeymooner ( they did reply an email saying we will have our special amenities ) once again I have mentioned to the receptionist (a guy) about that  when we arrived there . He replied me that he already noted actually when we arrived to our room there was nothing for honeymooner arrangements . I fed up & I called to them they said those were chargeable OMG I said I have travelled three destinations already Maldives, Cambodia , Malaysia but we at least got flower arrangement on bed as a honeymooner , then she replied me they have in hand for us & will send to the room .

"I had a very short stopover in Singapore and stayed at MBS. The room I got this round was slightly on the lower floor. Though it was lovely to oversee the Gardens but the noise from the traffic off the main street was a little annoying.   Still the food was great and the location is always a plus - as it is connected to the Mall, Convention Center and nearby MRT.   Services is always great here from the concierge to the front office personnel.",4,
"The hotel is very convenient for shopping, dining and walking around the Marina Harbour and Gardens by the Bay (if you don't want to spend on shopping😊). The Bayfront MRT is just below the hotel so it's very easy to transport to other tourist areas. The infinity pool was great but it was crowded late in the afternoon so we got there around 9am the next day, which is quite manageable. Our premier deluxe room with the Garden View was okay, and bathroom / tub were big. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.",4,
"The staff were very accommodating and reassuring. We booked 2 rooms with connecting doors. Rooms are well clean except for the terrace it was very dusty, bathrooms are huge unfortunately no bidet spray. Reception area was very crowded. The place itself is  very accessible to shopping malls and trains, infinity pool was amazing. We had a lavish buffet breakfast at Rise while breakfast at Spago was spectacular, overlooking the city skyline.",4,
We stayed for 2 nights in November 2016 (Friday and Saturday night)  Checked in very late due to flight and front reception staff very lovely. Check in was easy and quick. The lobby was beautiful and Christmas decorations had been set up already. We had the lead in room and it was extremely spacious. Very clean and bathroom facilities amazing. The shower and bath were the highlight. We stayed on the 29th floor and the view were great. We were able to watch the light show at night from our level. In room dining was good although expensive and the roof top pool is certainly a highlight. Will be back however not a cheap hotel at all. Location is great and train station underneath to get around the city easy. ,4,
"We never stayed in this hotel but our daughters did earlier this year and we took a wander through it on our way to Gardens on the Bay. Spectacular views, beautiful clean hotel. Photos girls sent were from the infinity pool open to guests....a must do activity if you stay there.",5,
"The hotel architecture is incredible and very bold. The infinity pool with all the roof top is an amazing experience: form the front side (infinity pool side to be clear) you see all the modern skyline of the city and the Sirloin on the other side of the lake, while from the back side (jacuzzi side) you see the bay and beneath the marina bay garden (must see attraction).  Impressive was that the bay was full of containerships and tankers, hundred of them!!!  Being on our honeymoon the budget was middle-top and we got a superior room with the view on the front...the room was very comfortable with a huge bathroom, but generally speaking a 4* with something missing to reach 5*.  We had always Breakfast at the ground restaurant which was composed by 4 buffets: one international…",4,
"This hotel is convenient to the VERY expensive mall.  There are luxury brands that I have never heard of!!! Waaay to pricey for me, but to window shop. I have a room on the 50th floor, with a view of the bay.  It was spectacular at any time of the day.  The room was comfortable, with all of the appropriate luxuries (coffee, robes, slippers, lots of outlets). The pool on the top floor is a must see.   The overpriced breakfast buffet can be skipped. It was awful. All of the staff were first class and very helpful.  Easy cab ride anywhere in the city, any time of day or night.",5,
We stayed here for one night our last night in Singapore and what a fantastic night it was .  The check in took a little while but they were updating there systems so it was quite slow but this did not put us off . The receptionist was very nice and we were able to check in early (was meant to be 3 but got to the hotel earlier than expected). Our room was superb over looking gardens by the bay . The whole hotel is out of this world . We wollowed in the pool and hot tub from 1pm until after 9pm . Such a beautiful view day and night . We did have quite a bit to drink and we were buzzing from the experience and properly the drink too 😁.

"Marina bay sand service is bad.  Before I stayed your hotel,  l believed your hotel that best of Hotel in Singapore.  But now, i know your hotel is nice only swimming pool.  I complained about mini bar and service. But Nobody said ""sorry or apologize"".  I know your hotel good business and high occupancy.  But no service and not happy when i stay your hotel. I request just small thing, but ignore . I called hotel about complain, one of staff said "" How can i help you now"".   정말 기대하고 갔지만....  방도 별로 기본적인 세면도구도 없고  서비스도... 연락하면 자기네 부서 일 아니라고 제가 그런게 아니라... 이런식 그냥 미안합니다 잠시만 기다려 주시겠어요? 이런 이야기면 참겠는데..  난 모른다는식의 서비스와 웃지도 않는 직원들의 서비스는 최악 이였습니다. 다시 가고싶지 않습니다.",1,
"My rating is only ""very good"" instead of ""excellent"" because there are too many tourists and you don't get the exclusivity like in other high-class hotels. Unfortunately, there are a lot of 'wannabes' who go there because of the name of the hotel but who are (excuse the word) chavs. Thankfully, you have the choice of various very good restaurants in the hotel so that, depending on your choice, you can avoid these people. Apart from that: beautiful view, nice rooftop lounge, nice sky bar and friendly staff.",4,
When to watch movie/show there a few time. Good things is there is alot of usher around to help you with direction. We never feel lost and can always depend on them especially if you are late they are all over the theatre to assist you. Very good service. Good job,4,

"We stayed 2 days and 1 night here as a staycation for our anniversary. The check in process was an absolute long wait, we waited 1 hour and 45mins. Rather odd since the guests check out at 11am and check in timing is 3pm, with so many hours to clean the rooms, I don't see why the check in can be delayed so late on ya week day.   Anniversary cake that my husband requested for was sent to our room as a birthday cake and had to be re decorated and sent again. Quite depressing after the long wait for check in.   Too many people, the pool area was crowded. Most are there to just take pictures. It's best to go super early in the morning so that you can avoid the crowd.   Only saving grace was the breakfast on the first floor. A very good spread of international food. ",3,
"Last visit to Singapore this hotel was still being built (towers were up but the 'ship' at the top was not). So it was high time to take a few day's rest at this iconic hotel and make use of the infinity pool.  The room had a king bed - very comfortable. Electronic sheer and blockout curtains were needed to keep out the morning sun as the room faces east onto the Garden by the Bay which is very nice since the SuperTrees light up at night making it a nice view to enjoy.   Multiple international power sockets were available, as well as free wifi.   Bathroom had a free standing bath, rainshower and normal shower rose, toilet, double sinks and plenty of shampoo, conditioner and body wash.

"Obviously, the place is famous for it's signature ""Infinity Swimming Pool"" on the roof. Central area and easy to access other places. Casino is just beneath LOL. If you're a model or photographer (wannabe? haha), go up early in the morning for perfect shoot. Else, expect to see all those crowd in a tiny pool (even it's called infinity).",4,
"This is one of the most extraordinary places I have ever seen. I am traveling a lot around the world, and there is no other similar concept. Try rooms over 20th floor with a view to the city. It worths every single cent!!! The rooms, the pool, the service, everything was outstanding....",5,
"If you like a breathtaking view, that's the place in Singapore but that was it. We had a 51st floor suite at app. 1000 S$ per night and the view was great. The rooms are nice, large, clean and perfectly fine. A little attention to details like a mandarin oriental is missing.   The rest of the stay was a total disappointment as it is a totally overcrowded place like disneyworld. You need to queue everywhere like reception and concierge for long - 30-80 people is quite normal. The service is poor for 5 star hotel and like mc Donald's- wait queue and rush to get your meal done. The complimentary club 55 for suites is just crap. Noisy and an atmosphere like fast food just the view is good. At the weekend during the afternoon you have a queue which makes you wait for an hour to…",2,

Proximity to MRT & shopping mall 4. We were gratified by a surprise wedding anniversary cake and macaroons 5. The in-room dining caters to most of the worldwide cuisines if not all  Cons: 1.

Dont feel like going out, but on a budget, head to Nanyang 1983, toast box, the main foodcourt at lower ground floor (open 24 hours) or simply go to Fatt Choi inside the main casino. No worry, service is super friendly.  Call concierge or housekeeping, super efficient and friendly. I even got my own mini fridge delivered for $10 rental (cold storage supermarket at LG floor). Walk around the bay. One full round from MBS to Fullerton and the Merlion and back takes an hour. So lovely, tranquil and scenic. Walk about the upper wooden deck or to Makan Sutra for some nice hawker food.  I can go on and on....",5,

Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for one night on our way to the Philippines as a stopover from Australia. The pool and spa facility's on the top floor are amazing and it's so easy to get to the MBS food court and access to the casino within the hotel. We travelled to and from Changi airport to the hotel by the MRT train which takes roughly 45 mins and is such a cheap way to do it 2.60 SGD each per way. I also left my credit card at reception on departure and someone rang ahead and cancelled the card for me which was very honest! ,5,

"I agree what's great about this hotel: pool and view. I also agree what's disappointing: average room and lack of character and food choice.  Pro: Quiet (39th floor), nice staff, direct access to subway.   Unlike many other guests, we had no line to check in, and the reception pleasantly gave us a room although it's still 10:30 am.  I had sore throat and noticing that, a room service lady came back with a pot of hot water and honey & lemon.  Con: Less we'll-appointed room such as awkward sink and lighting.   Overpriced, overcrowded, and underwhelming restaurants, extremely disappointing being in a foodie heaven Singapore.   Very slippery pool area, saw people slipping and falling a few times. Supposedly massive gym but after 7 am too crowded.  I'm more for old charm…",3,
"An incredible set of buildings topped by what looks like a gigantic surfboard from afar, I greatly enjoyed the hotel though in the lobby it felt more cheap than it deserves.  We got upgraded to a small suite which was great.  I had asked and was given a city view room which delivered incredible vistas of the city day and night.  It was pretty cool.  But not as much as the famous infinity pool on the 'surfboard'!  The hotel restricts access to the pool to only guests which seems hardline for those of us with local friends with whom we want to hang out but it makes perfect sense.  Though there is plenty of space, it was pretty full and those were just guests!  Imagine if we all got to invite others!  I liked the chairs that were either in the water or raised high right by the…",5,
"Loved our stay. We were Club class, so smooth check in, upgraded to City View Room - view over to the Merlion. Great room on 39th floor, so very near the infinity pool, which was a real buzz. Loved the cocktail hours - real champagne & bites.",5,
"Thanks to a convention I attended I got to stay at this iconic hotel. It was an amazing experience from start to finish. We were fortunate to get a room on the 19th floor facing the bay with a huge balcony. The view to the gardens by the bay with the artificial trees and all was a sight for sore eyes, And every evening, they'd play songs from musicals and the trees would 'light up with dance' to the music. Really lovely. The room was great, service impeccable, everything went really smoothly from check-in to check-out, hardly had a wait and all. All in all a memorable experience.",4,
"We were seduced by the exceptional eclectic forms and architecture to organise our stay, beyond our "" comfort-zone"" ( Mandarin/ peninsula/raffles) in this massive but special massive hotel... Our experience exceeded our expectations the service was all the way impeccable, the rooms were clean and spacious, the bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was with a large choice...and of course the pool, the main reason of our stay is incredible...Despite the  massive number of people in huge hall ways ( like grand central station in NYC), at the pools, during breakfast, check in/out in the elevators... it was worth The stay...",5,
"The famous Marina Bay Sands in singapore, has been always a famous place for its infinity pool but that is not the only attraction for this lovely place. The deluxe room has a lovely decorations with top quality furniture, beddings, toiletries. The room is spacious and has a balcony with a nice view of the ocean and the garden by the bay. However this view is subject to the availability so you should always check with the reservation team beforehand.   The infinity pool is great, you should definitely spend more time there rather than in the room! The pool is always full of people taking pictures or selfies, but do not worry there is always a spot for everyone to stand as the pool is quite long. The view is perfect and the atmosphere is great up there with amazing view of the…",5,
"We checked in and was given 2nd floor Deluxe Room.  It was very small and only had 2 single beds. The ""Garden View"" was the garden on the side of the road. For $400+ a night this was disgusting.   Next day we got an upgrade for $50 p/n  48th floor and the view was great.  The room was a little bigger but very average. For the money you would expect something a bit more special.  We stayed 3 nights and asked for a late check out.  8PM but we were told we would have to pay for a whole day. OK    BUT since we were in a Premium deluxe room it would be $950.  So guess what we checked out and went to the Crown Plaza at the airport for 8 hours for $180.   Pool was Great I must say    But I will neve stay there again.",3,
"Well I'll never stay here again total waste of time and money. Over priced and zero management. Infinity pool is over crowded. Buffet was very small. We waited atleast 30min to 1 hour to get room key Inorder to get to know the room which are allotted to us were not yet checked out.... hence, jus for check inn we wasted approx 2 hours and hotel has policy of check in at 3 and check out at 11. Will never recommend it to anyone.",5,
"Pros:  1. The architecture and infinity pool are rad.  2. Enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Rise (a little too much probably).  3. Our room on the 45th floor had a lovely view of gardens by the bay and the room itself was fairly plush and comfortable.  Cons:  1. On one of the days my boyfriend and I were waiting in the lobby lift well to get back up to our room. A staff member ran up after me and asked in an accusatory tone(borderline shouting to be honest) if I was a hotel guest, to which I replied that I was. She simply turned her back and walked away without another word. It was a strange and uncomfortable experience, particularly as we were reasonably well dressed and gave no reason to be suspicious. 2. It's luxurious, but not luxurious enough to get what you pay for. This was…",3,
We are two backpackers so we stayed here just for one night as a one off and I can tell that we did not regret the decision that we made. Hotel was amazing. We stayed in a spacious room with a View of MARINA BAY gardens. The staff was very nice and friendly. It was very busy at the normal check it - so the lady took us to the VIP section which was very nice of her. We mostly enjoyed the sky pool - spent there nearly all day. I must say - the chips that we got was quite poor - McDonalds offer better and cheaper potato chips haha. But overall - great experience.,5,
"Great location with excellent facilities,service and location. Check in & out quick and efficient. The pool is fanciful. We had a fantastic time and hope will go again.You need to stay at MBS at least once in a lifetime.",5,
"Its true that the sheer size of the hotel can give the feeling of arriving at an airport rather than a hotel, its overwhelming at first. However, its a wonderful hotel. We had the city view room, which was nice and including breakfast which we took downstairs and at the pool. Both were excellent! The location is very good as well (casino, mall, gardens, subway, etc.) and also in walking distance to downtown. Of course, the pool is the hotel's highlight and apart from the ever-present selfie sticks its a one of a kind view.",5,
"I have been there for a whole week. Of course the rooftop pool is breathtaking, however it is super crowded most of the time. Best is to go there early morning. A very bad surprise is the nearby restaurant, which has a strange dress code for a pool bar forbidding towels, bath robes or swimming suits. So after your morning swim, if you want to enjoy breakfast there you have to come back to your room (3 elevators) to change and then back to the pool (another 3 elevators), which of course I didn't do.  The rooms are nicely furnished and spacious. But the lobby looks more like a train station, with tourists making up their luggages in every corner, trolleys.. And above all this constant crowd..  I tried to call from my room for laundry collection, noone answered after 7 minutes…",3,
"We had 2 nights in a room on the 33rd floor.  Lets start with the cons Air conditioning  very noisy had to be turned off to get any sleep. Haven't  had such a noisy air con since staying in an outback hotel in the middle of Australia in the 80s.  Thankfully  the  room itself was not too hot without the  air. Room service? What room service? Unlike the cheap outback hotel, where the room was serviced everyday, clean linen, plenty of tea and coffee (also biscuits) replenished. Bathroom supplies replenished. When we arrived back at MBS, in the afternoon, after walking about 5kl near the Greenway (which is closed till 2018  as there is a pipline going  In.) We found our room totally  untouched. The house cleaning staff were in the  corridor,  so we tried  to  ask  them  about  the …",3,
"Amazing building. Very impressive architecture. The hotel is beaming with life, a very very busy place, with tons to see and do. The downside of it all is that the hotel is so big that it's not easy to find your way around.  The sky Bar is the place to go to for a Singapore Sling (or two), for the view of the city and for the sunset. Plenty to eat at breakfast buffet.  Service overall is excellent. The staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We only had two poor experiences. We were misled by a staff about how best to get to the sky bridge connecting the hotel and the Gardens by the Bay. He should have just said: sorry, I don't really know, please ask someone else!  Another time when we wanted to visit the infinity pool, the lady at the door was so rude I couldn't believe…",4,
"Stunning views over Singapore, Superb design and best cocktails! Stayed for 4 days during business trip. Even though i faced some noise issues due to an event which was taking place in the hotel, Staff was more than kind to transfer me to higher level and upgrade my room so i  got a marvelous view of the gardens by the bay and both domes. Everything you needed was just under your feet (except from the swimming pool!!!). a huge shopping mall and casino on the basement and superb SkyPark bars (both CelaVi and the Flight bar) offered the best view you could handle! have also to admit that i had my best Apple Martini ever  at the main lobby at the Rise lounge. I arranged the majority of my meetings in the hotel where the atmosphere assisted both myself and my associates to have a…",5,
"We arrived on noon of 24 Nov 2016 , we faced to long line hold for booking !!! Can't believe after around 9 hours flight faced to such unbelievable welcome ! We refused to stay on that line for around 2 hours meanwhile no sit and chair in lobby of hotel and no one even see u to bring welcoming even water! I travelled with child any way the reception told us this system updating issue and delivered us some restaurant compelementroy   Vacher but manage to delivered good room I hope rest of our vacation here get well . But we stocked for the reception system after 9 hours flight and get so so tired then refused to rest hold day in room and indeed lost one day of our trip here .       ",2,
"As others have complained about, check-in took nearly an hour during which the attendant was unhelpful and incredibly slow.  We had asked months in advance for a high-level room and were assured that they could do that for us over the phone. The room they gave us was on the 9th floor, is extremely loud from the outside, and we do not even have a good view.  When we tried to call for support the front desk told us they would call us back which, again, never happened.  So far our trip is a complete disappointment and waste of money. Not at all worth enjoyable and a horrible introduction to Singapore, sadly.",1,
"The hotel is average, nothing particularly special.  The bed was hard and the room temperature was not constant. The views from the balcony over the water were good and the design of the balcony was good in that you didn't feel like you were on a higher level.  I fear that the hotel was cutting edge when it was built but isn't anything special now.  ",4,
"Whether you're enjoying a short stop over or staying in Singapore for a while, Marina Bay Sands will not disappoint - it has everything for everyone.  For my friends and I, we wanted relaxation with a touch of luxury and this is exactly what we got.  The infinity pool is amazing, although the views don't compare to those of Sydney Harbour, they are still impressive.  It wasn't too busy either which was great and poolside service enhanced our experience further. Cocktails by the infinity pool = instant relaxation.  The rooms are beautifully appointed with an amazing bathroom and uber comfy beds.  I usually have problems with hotel pillows but there were at least 4 pillows to choose from so I slept like a baby.    The service is also wonderful, beautiful and friendly staff who…",5,
I can't fault anything truth be told. Service was excellent. Check-In process was quick too. I stayed in a deluxe (City View) room and I found the size of the room is decent enough. Staffs were keen to help. Highly recommended. Will return again.  Thanks,5,
"This is the largest and longest infinity pool at that height! Located at the 57th floor of the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel! This hotel is really amazing. Its really worth staying here.  The room was clean and you can really smell the towels dey and clean. No stinky smell. The shampoo, conditioner, body wash smell good.  The staffs were so kind and helps you. Staffs in the pool area are awesome. They are very attentive with towel requests. Always ready with a smile.  A must stay even just for a night when in Singapore.",5,
"We stayed here for 2 nights only, but had an amazing experience. The size of everything is gigantic. Check in was fairly quick. We checked in at tower 3 and got a room in tower 1, the walk trough the lobby area was a good reminder on how big this hotel is. When we finally got to the elevator and up to our suite at the 51. floor the view was amazing. The feeling of standing at your own veranda this high up looking over the bay of Singapore was breathtaking. The room had a modern touch and the bed was amazing.  We had a unique experience when doing the morning swim at the infinity pool at 0645 in the morning while the sun came up well worth the price of staying at this hotel.   The lounge was also among the best I've seen at any hotel. Service was excellent and even if it was very…",5,
"We had a great such a experience. Upon checking in they upgraded our room to a city view.   Our room was clean and included a safe, hair dryer and free wifi access.   We initially booked this hotel because of their famous infinity pool. We absolutely it! The pool is broken in 3 sections, each section has the same view  so it doesn't really matter where you go. Your are required to bring a room key for each person to enter and leave pool area.   This hotel is connected to a mall that has many eatery to choose from. No need to even leave the hotel premise as you will have everything there.",5,
Our first visit to Singapore so we wanted to stay at the MBS. We reserved a Grand Club room.  We can't recommend it. The lounge is severely undersized to serve the guests with access.  We waited over 30 minutes just to get seated in the early evening. Totally unacceptable especially at the significant price premium. Our room was large and spacious but the space was underutilized. It seems like they just spread the furniture out rather than adding pieces to add warmth and comfort. When watching the light show be sure to take it in from ground level as well as in your room. It is a very different experience.  The casino was huge but you had to queue to have your passport checked to go in and to leave.  That took 10 minutes each time.  Subway access was easy.  Access to the top…,3,
"The building is spectacular. Such interesting architecture. The suite was beautiful - large, with east and west views. Wonderful bathroom with a soaking tub with gorgeous view. All around, very comfortable. The service was excellent.   The infinity pool is spectacular and is the main reason I chose to stay there. It did not disappoint. I did not eat at any of the restaurants in the building, but there are many, with world - renowned chefs.   It was a great experience but I recommend only a couple of days. It is much like Vegas - a small dose is ok.",5,
"This is one of the iconic hotels in Singapore. The hotel is operated by the SANDS GROUP of US, and being considered as one of the best hotels in town. The location of the hotel is good, in the city center, easily reached by taxis, buses, MRT......The hotel has three blocks viz T1, T2, T3 and house the Casino. The rooms are spacious and well provided for, in line with most luxurious hotels. The top of the hotel has the famous skyline swimming pool, and accord a good view of the city, especially during the early evening. There are many restaurants and eateries, with a good price range and variety. The iconic: ""Garden of the Bay"" is within walking distance from the hotel. Lots of shops, both of Branded goods and average type. A GOOD HOTEL to experience while visiting Singapore.",4,
"hotel is located at a MRT station with shopping mall so it is very convenient but not a lot of cheap food options (what do you expect, it's Marina Bay Sands). Big hotel with many many rooms. As for ambience, don't expect any, you will see Chinese PRC tourists with crying babies and loud grannies to couples on honeymoon trip. Bustling lobby.  As for the room, it was pretty average. Comfortable beds, good bathrooms. Nothing outstanding. The view is great though, you'll see skyscrappers, majestic buildings.  I didn't visit the rooftop pool, not that I regretted it. Ermm, check this hotel off my list, I will not be back.",3,
"Pro: Iconic design. Infinity pool was real cool. Room clean.   Con: All around mediocre service. Room amenities. Cheap toiletries.   Bottom line: We did not feel like we were valued at all. Their service is on par with motel 6, but motel 6 is $60 dollars a night. Our room was $540. We get a strong sense that the hotel is looking to extract every last dollars from you without offering the same service in return.",2,
"The top of the hotel swimming pool, swimming pool is very large, very exciting invincible infinity pool, above 57 levels, you can see the sunrise and sunset, it is amazing! This is one of the reasons why I chose it, if you do not stay in Marina Bay, you just like not come to Singapore, the price is expensive but it is worth t, and the service attitude is also very good! Highly recommended! The room is very clean, the lobby decoration is very luxurious, but also in the attractions of the nobility. The central subway station near the hotel .Hotel facing the Gardens by the Bay, the super tree is very big and tall, many light on the trees and the light will have different colour. In front of the hotel, have water show at night , You can go around the bay to walk,  talk with family,…",5,
"My friends and I stayed at MBS because we wanted to experience this one-of-a-kind hotel in SG. Check-in was smooth, the staff was efficient and answered all our inquiries. The hotel had a nice smell, as hotel hallways would have an unusual smell if the carpets are not regularly cleaned and maintained. Our room was nice with a view overlooking the bay. Room, beds and toilets are clean. I love the smell of their bath amenities. We totally enjoyed the buffet breakfast! Food was delicious and with plenty to choose from. Staff were so efficient! We also watched Wicked: The Musical at MasterCard Theatre and totally enjoyed this experience as well.  We love that the hotel had a walkway leading to The Shoppes and Gardens by the Bay. It was so convenient!  My only comment was that they…",4,
"A must stay luxurious hotel, very iconic in singapore. You will be able to access to the Skypark with skyline view, swimming, dining, hi tea etc. Morning, Sunset and Night view are recommended. You will enjoy the Infinity pool to tge fullest!!!",5,
"This hotel is amazing! Staffs are very friendly and professional. Check in and check out was swift and efficient. We got a room overlooking the Gardens by the Bays and I tell you the view is worth the stay (request for higher level room). If you are into photography, you will definitely enjoy the sunrise view from your room balcony.",5,
"awesome stay at Marina Bay sands Tower 2. Room was Gardens by the bay facing, so could get a different view of the light and sound show and it was a great experience. the rooms are big, airy and very comfortable. the staff is good and helpful.over all great experience.",5,
"I think it is a must do at least once. The opulence is impressive!  The huge place is impressive.  The room , we had a club room, large. The only annoying thing were the lights command to the bathroom.  Bfast at club 55 great variety.  Afternoon drinks too very nicely presented.  We hard dinner at Long Chim and it was really worth is if you know the street food of Bangkok.  In the basement you can have a neck and shoulders and body massage for 140 dollars for 90 minutes. Great value if you do not want to go out to cheaper places.  The view... yes impressive.  Go for a walk along the promenade.  The swimming pool has the section without kids which is nice.  The staff is excellent.  I would give 4.5 but with no option 4 it is.  The reward card. Not sure if it is worth it as you do…",4,
"This place is amazing in every word..Starting  from the great service to the impressive amenities , this hotel is just magnificent. I am a explorer and usually like to visit the local places but for the first time in all my travels I felt like I wanted to stay just in the hotel..Nevertheless, there is a lot to explorer and see in Singapore.  The buffet they offer with the room is top-notch and you can choose form the several restaurants they have within the hotel. I recommend the Roof top even tho it can get a bit hot; is better to go early in the morning and experience the amazing view of the infinity pool while drinking a latte from the restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel.. Definitely you get what you pay for..",5,
"We go to Singapore often but decided to try out MBS for once.  First things first - be prepared for a massive hotel which is anything but cozy.  Getting into the taxi the driver asked us if we wanted to go to MBS Tower 1 or 3.  We had no idea, but it doesn't really matter as you can walk from one end to the other.  We arrived at the entrance Tower 1 and there were huge crowds in the lobby waiting to check in.  Thankfully we could check in at the VIP or lounge area as we had booked the family suite.  Nevertheless there was still a long queue there.  After a while we sorted things out and checked into our room on the 2nd floor.  There was no view, but the lack of it was made up by a huge room capable of sleeping 4 and a large outdoor balcony.  The room is perfect for a family of…",4,
"It's a World's largest Atrium Casino at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore with over 600 Table Games, more than 1500 Slots and a wide array of dinning options really it's awesome one must visit this place to try their luck.",5,
Awesome place and a beautifully architected building.  Pros : Superb pool with a skyline view. Good housekeeping and courteous staff.  Large spread for breakfast. Cons : Club on terrace - nothing to speak about.  Not much variety in lunch and dinner food.,4,
An amazing hotel with a great staff and pre-stay communication.  The pool on the 57 floor is just spectacular and the view is unmatched.  Getting to the pool can be challenging since it takes a couple of different elevators to get there.  It is not the cheapest place to stay but still worth every penny. The casino is large and even has a non-smoking floor.  The rooms are huge and again the views are amazing.,5,
"We had our family visit in Singapore last 2014. We stayed in Marina Bay Sands, what we really like was the hotel architectural design and the infinity pool was magnificent! They have plenty of restaurants and shops.",5,
Great hotel. Unbelievably high prices. Why have a 10 square metre balcony without a stick of furniture. What is its purpose? The roof top pool is spectacular and the only reason it's worth staying here. Takes longer to check in for a £500 a night room than a £25 flight on Easy Jet.  ,4,
"I went here with my brother. Upon check in they will ask a deposit which you can use during your stay or probably to answer for breakages. To start with, this is really a 5 star experience. staff and crew were attentive and accomodating. The food for in room service are also good. It's so convenient cos downstairs is the marina bay shoppes and yoy could just do your shopping without going too far. The exterior is good. The interior like is nice. The rooms are spacious. And of course, who would miss the rooftop infinity pool. it was suck an amazing experience. best chill out place. the drinks the sunset the view. It's like a catch all place. I'm definitely going back 👍 btw, yup everything in this place comes with a tag ",5,
"This hotel is very representative of Singapore - get it on a deal when you book your trip or give it a miss.   Checking in can be a tedious affair but the staff are very nice   1. Rooms are very spacious, we had a city view for $68 more definitely the way to go. The room had a great feel to it, bed was nice and comfortable, electrically controlled curtains :-)  Good bathroom, we did not have a bath only a shower.  Rate the room 8 out of 10  Has a bar fridge in the room - deal is $10 for two Coca Cola's. if you remove anything from the bar fridge they will charge you, even if you put it back....be warned  They do provide an additional fridge if you take your own things, $10 for the delivery and use 2. Hotel services, such as Spa are unnervingly expensive - deal was $630 for…",4,
Rooms were very large and the view was to die for.  Too expensive for what you get.  The pool was not what I expected.  The views were excellent but in pictures I had seen it showed one large pool across the top of the toweres.  But the pool was divided into 3 sections not what I expected.,4,
"amazing stay at this beautiful hotel. from the moment when you step into the lobby and check in, the staff are very warm and friendly. the amenities in the room are fantastic and also the view (we had the garden view) however i must say it was very pleasant. breakfast is great here and there is a wide choice to have. food was delicious. the plus point for this hotel is the rooftop swimming pool which is iconic. you can easily find a sunlounger and just watch the city of singapore view - simply fantastic. lots of bars upstairs and a club. i would definately recommend this hotel for anyone coming to singapore!",5,
"Well the building itself is the main reason for the 5 stars. Sunrise in the pool on the roof magnificent. Rooms: top, just top. Rooftop bar (Ce La Vi) and food top notch, but it's big, it's very very big. Staff friendliness depends a bit on whom you run into.",5,
"This is a wonderful hotel in Singapore. I recommend that you live in this hotel because it's good service. You should go to the swimming pool and restaurant on the top floor of hotel. You can see the whole scenery of Singapore when you were swimming. You can see the merlion park. This is a famous building in Singapore. The top floor like a boat. You swam at the middle of boat. The swimming pool is great, beautiful.  The swimming near restaurant. You can enjoy your dinner after you were swimming. I recommend that you went to swim in afternoon. You watch the scenery of evening and night. This is different feeling about Singapore. The marina bay sands hotel has casino. You play gambling in the hotel. I don't recommend you went to casino because it spend a lot of time for enter…",5,
"You can't go wrong with an observation deck.  This one offers superb views south, east and north, but, unless you're a hotel guest, you don't get to enjoy much of the view of the industrialised west, including the docks, of which I would have liked to have seen more.  There's a bar and other opportunities to spend even more money, but the view of people taking selfies against the backdrop of the observation deck whilst there are 200 ships parked within a stone's throw is not to be missed.",3,
"We promised ourselves last time we were in Singapore that we had to stay at MBS. We were not disappointed from the time Diane at the front desk Tower 1 checked us in to picking up our sands rewards lifestyle package and then heading to the 43rd floor of Tower 3 overlooking the Gardens, a night golf course and the harbour. The surprise is when you walk into your room. Our porter explained all the features of the room and other things in and around the hotel. We were only going to be there one night so we made full use of the rooftop pool, bar and eating facilities. All VG. We stayed up as long as we could to take in the view. We had breakfast by the pool, no better way than being in a pool 57 floors up overlooking the CBD of Singapore. It is worth it just to say you have been…",5,
"We stayed for just one night on the way to Thailand, and it was just amazing!  Totally worth the price tag for the experience.  The pool area is incredible, both during the day and at night.  The hotel rooms are nothing special, but there's so much more to see and do, we didn't spend much time there.  We read a lot of reviews complaining about the length of check in/out time, but we didn't find this to be a problem at all and only waited a few minutes for both.",5,
"We stayed for two nights in a Club Room/ City View on the 40th Floor.  The hallway from the front door to the bedroom/ living area was 20 feet long. In the hallway was a Keurig type coffee maker with tea also.  When you enter the room and place the room key into the power slot, it causes the lights to go on, and the drapes to open automatically revealing the view of the bay and all its splendor. The kingsized bed was most comfortable and came with 4 plush pillows.  The TV was good sized for the large room, and there were USB charger ports for our devices. The free WiFi was fast and easy to use throughout the hotel area, room, and poolside. We were able FaceTime back home to show everyone, the room view and the infinity edged pool on the 57th floor. Be warned, it is spectacular…",5,
"Impressive looking building fabulously located on the Marina front. Our room was large with two extra large single beds. It had an amazing view over The Gardens at the Bay and the South China Sea. But the reason for booking was the swimming pool. I could have sat there morning, noon & night. It really has to be seen to be believed. The views of the city and the sun setting are to die for.",5,
"Checking in was a breeze at 9.30pm on 4/11 for our 3 night 2 day stay, can't really complain about that. Given room cards for our room that was specifically booked with a balcony, clarification was made the day before we left Sydney on the 24/10 starting the holiday and on check in, arrive on level 24 the view wasn't too bad, opened the door to a railing, no balcony, called reception who stated there was no other rooms.   Backwards and forwards with the duty manager for 10 to 15 minutes and all of a sudden a room was available on level 9. Moved down to there where we had balcony as requested ( really should not be that hard) and surprisingly for a supposed 5 star hotel, nothing to sit on and take in the minimal view. 6 showers  in 2 days from venturing out and still only managed…",1,
We were very lucky as we were upgraded to a deluxe suite but the whole experience was not one to forget. The view from the room was the best I've ever had in a hotel. Then you have the skypark where the infinity pool is located. I actually preferred the view at night than in the day. Seeing the city all light up was incredible. Truly an unforgettable experience staying at this hotel. Although it is obviously very expensive in the bar and restaurants but the quality is top. We are young backpackers so for us it was a treat to stay for one night but would recommend either doing one night like we did or would be a great location for a honeymoon ! ,5,
"Stayed 6 nights 44th floor room 63,a superb room, large bathroom heaps of room, spotless and a view over the gardens across to the busy waterfront, no need for tv thats for sure. Breakfast in an incredibly busy restaurant staffed by friendly and efficient personal more than compensated for the lengthy walk from the tower blocks, the variety and quality,let alone the quantity outstanding. Found the whole experience from registration to checkout easy peezy, Had a great time exploring this massive building which is initially quite intimidating,superlatives around every corner, just amazing. Defiantly would stay there again.",5,
"It's almost not worth reviewing Marina Bay Sands as you know it's going to be great regardless! Just see all the reviews below.   But the staff at the hotel really made the trip for me, nothing was too much effort, they were extremely helpful and polite, and the room service was excellent.  You pay for the view more than anything, but the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were huge!  The breakfasts were incredible, definitely worth getting your monies worth there! The fresh made omelettes and warm cinnamon buns were my favourite.   It's quite overwhelming and I got lost in the shopping centre so many times. Sometimes it's nice to have a cosier feel to a hotel but as long as you're expecting the sheer size of it all before you arrive you won't be let down.   Best hotel…",5,
"Wow.. the view over here is really awesome..  I went there for a business meeting from morning until evening, the environment there is really can make me feel peace, especially the sunset v the golden marina bay sand towers. ",4,
"This is just the most tallest and modern building and if you are afraid of heights this is not a place for you to visit.  I never realised how scared of heights I really was until I visited here.  You will get the most amazing views if you are able to stomach the heights.  I would certainly recommend this for a visit, but think seriously if you have any issues with heights as it is a very long, long way from the ground.",5,
"We didn't stay in this hotel. We got off the hop on, hop off bys here & went to the top. We was going to pay to go to the observatiin deck but the man at the counter said you can go upto the bar for free with the same view.  You have to go into the hotel & in the lift to floor 57. When you get to the top the view is just amazing! You can only go in the affinity pool if your a guest at the hotel (thatbis what we was told).  If you are in Singapore it is worth a visit, just for the view. Absolutely beautiful.",5,
"Marina Bay sands has been one of my favourite hotel till date, it had entirely different atmosphere.! The best part was the Infinity Pool and the view from there, and also the friendly behaviour of the staff!  And also the rooms which were so beautiful neat and clean! I've had a very memorable experience at MBS😍 ",5,
From the moment we arrived till we checked out we where blown away. The staff where so friendly & very quick on service. We stayed 3 nights. We where upgraded at check in from level 22 to 34. With two little children aged 3 & 4 we where treated like royality. From a standard room to a balcony room.  Breakfast was outstanding anything & everything on offer. Rooms where spotless each & everyday. The beds where like sleeping on clouds. The bath was big enough to fit the four of us in it. The swimming pool blew our minds.  We couldn't speak any higher about our stay at Marina Bay Sands. We would 100% stay again and would highly recommend anyone thinking of staying here.   I personally would like to thank all the staff for making our stay a fabulous one.,5,
"We stay two nights in the hotel. From the room u have a excellent view of the garden or the bay especially at the night. The breakfast have a very good choice. The lobby is very large and too busy. Awesome and large infinity pool, very nice. ",4,
An awesome place to be see if you are in Singapore or if you are going to Singapore!! The view from the top floor is wonderful!! You can see entire Singapore.. the shopping mall is above the standards n expectations. Casio is superb !! Need one full day as Lots of places to see.. enjoyed a lot definitely recommended !!,5,
"Not a typical 5 star hotel where you get a warm greeting or a welcome drink or a place to seat while waiting to be checked in.  The lobby was a total chaos, there were lots of walk-ins and guests trying to check-in and the seating area was more than packed. One of the staff was kind enough to transfer some of the guests to the vip check in and so we were entertained right away by a Filipina receptionist Kat and she was very warm and made sure we get the best deluxe room there is. When we entered the room, it was a bit small than I expected and nothing special given that this is a 5 star hotel I was somewhat frustrated actually. But the garden view was amazingly picturesque so it melted my heart away. We went up to the pool which was packed. View was of course again breathtaking.…",4,
"After spending two nights in relative solitude at Sofitel Sentosa Resort and Spa we targeted Marina Bay Sands for the next hit on our life savings and senses. Marina Bay Sands is always busy. 24/7.  The day before while basking by the pool at the Sofitel I got an SMS from MBS asking for time of arrival etc. etc. ""to expedite check in"". No worries. Off I sent the SMS with a cheeky upgrade request.  Arriving by taxi to MBS at Tower 1 you are faced with a permanent Pokemon Go gathering. Seems that there is some good stuff in the lobby to be caught. While I waited in the queue to check in a staff member came up to me and asked for my details. Ok. So I said them again. And off he walks. No reason given. No advantages apparent. Worse was to come. Room wasn't ready. SO WHAT WERE THE…",3,
"Family room was superb- ample space for everyone to jump around. Excellent view of Gardens by the Bay especially at night, and of course, the iconic infinity pool. Breakfast was sumptuous and the service outstanding. This hotel makes up for a total first-class  shopping and dining experience. With loads of entertainment and attractions, one can never get bored staying at this hotel.",5,
"Our first time in Singapore and we decided to go all out!  Being a fan of F1, we decided to take a 10-day holiday in Singapore this year and take in the F1 Night Race as well! What a fantastic experience - staying at the Marina Bay Sands was simply the best!  To top it all we stayed in a Club Room and benefited from all the extras to make this holiday really special! It was worth every penny!  The quality of the service, the food, the room, the views from the room, the Club Lounge on 55, the infinity pool on 57, the gym, the list is endless, was second to none!!  A thoroughly enjoyable stay in a most fantastic city!  A special mention and shout out needs to go to Kodies, Muhaiman and Lincoln, the waiters in the Club Lounge on 55 who went out of their way to make sure we had the…",5,
"For our honeymoon, my husband and I wanted to visit Singapore just to stay at the Marina Bay Sands and oh boy what an amazing stay it was! With a spacious room on the 44th floor overlooking the lake and botanical garden, we could not have asked for more in order to chill and relax. The infinity pool was amazing and the view from up there is breathtaking. Although this hotel is quite pricey, I can affirm that is is worth every cent!!!",5,
"Staffs were very welcoming and helpful. As you enter the room, the curtains will unveil the amazing view of Singapore with Merlion on the other side.... its totally AWESOME! Even my kids did really appreciate it. The infinity pool was great with breath-taking view of Singapore.",5,
Well what can you say about this hotel. Just fantastic. Ginormous .We didnt do much here as we were on a tight schedule ie. a day trip to Singapore. I would say it was well worth a visit. If I stayed here I would book it for a least two days so that you could get your directions and soak up the ambience of the place.,5,
"This is by far the priciest hotel I have stayed at and it's easy to understand why their rates are high. Premium location, fantastic amenities, fast and friendly service, excellent buffet, great shopping options - overall amazing place! It's a great hotel everyone should experience at least once in Singapore!",5,
"Worth every cent.....yes expensive for one nights stay, but well worth it. Stayed on the 44th floor, with views of both the city and parklands.   This apartment blew my mind from the minute we opened the door......electric opening curtains to the most amazing view of Singapore from the lounge room, the bathroom was beautiful, the bathtub overlooked the gardens and the shower was big enough to fit 10 people in it lol. Telephones in the toilets, the bed super comfy, felt like Royalty.   We stayed to celebrate our anniversary and was not disappointed.   Room service was excellent, every little detail taken care of.    Thro on your bikini/swimmers and head to the infinity pool, nothing in the world like it......breath taking, drink service was excellent.   A casual stroll thru the…",5,
"We were greeted by Sam and Diane and were very impressed with their level of attention to us upon check in. Also Leonard at check out. All very helpful.. Our room was outstanding , the views magnificent and the over all experience awesome.",5,
"If you want to treat yourself, then Marina Bay Sands is it. From arriving at the hotel to checking-out, the service delivered was certainly a 5 star experience. The service was so smooth and efficient. The lobby was very busy. However, at no point did I worry about the small details such as luggage. The premier room is very luxurious – I can’t get over how big the shower is and the free-standing bath. The room I stayed in started to show signs of general wear and tear. However, you quickly forget about these minor details, when you head up to Infinity Pool, which is no doubt this hotel’s star attraction. The views are certainly breath-taking. MBS also houses the Banyan Tree Spa, luxury shopping, bars and restaurants. If this hotel is outside your budget, even if you check-in for…",5,
"Hotel was perfect, its absolutely hugeeeeee so much to take in from the first sight, connected to a mall so allows you to breakaway from the hugeee hotel to grab a coffee. Location is perfect, get to view the entire marina. ( we chose the marina view ) Service - apart from mix up at check in, the staff are friendly. Pool - Main reason for checking into this hotel, luckily only hotel guests are allowed there otherwise there wouldn't be anywhere to sit.  Pool is amazing, views are amazing, downside is, does get very very busy.   All in all definitely one of the best hotels in the world, worth a visit!",5,
"Amazing hotel in Singapore! The room view was amazing to the Bay.  We went on our honeymoon and first of all we had an upgrade room to a suite. This made our stay more happy, confortable and thankfull.   The suite room was very nice with amazing view of the city. The room was clean and the hotel services were excelent! It made our honeymoon unforgettable.",5,
We had the pleasure of one night in this world famous resort and would recommend to anybody! Well worth the price for the experience of the grandeur that is Marina Bay Sands and a dip in the incredible rooftop infinity pool ,5,
"Great place to relax. Pool, gardens, restaurants, shopping all in one place. Service is excellent for the Singapore standards. If staff is bit more friendly, what else you need. Price is bit more than other hotels but you will love it.",5,
This hotel is huge and does lack the features of a warm and fuzzy hotel. It's more designed for conferences. Although breath taking I was a little disappointed.  The low lights first. We went to Adrift restaurant Celebrity Chef but I think he was out for the night as the food we were served was cold and tasteless wine prices you need to take a personal loan out. High light was Spago by Wolfgand Puck  was amazing also Sky on 57 Rood top by Justin Quek again  very impressed. The sky bars are breath taking looking over signapore  but don't expect change from $100 for 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine. Infinity Pool - I've never seen so many selfie sticks in my life and get there early as it's packed by 10.30am Unless your a millionaire don't shop there. A once off but I wont be back.,5,
"One of the best hotel where I have ever been! The price might be quite expensive but it's almost once in a lifetime experience. The restaurants and especially pool in 57th floor are ""must see"". There are shopping center, casino and expo center in the same complex. All the most famous places in Singapore are in walking distance from that hotel.",5,
"Well known for its iconic Marina bay sands infinity pool on the 55th floor of the hotel it is around 20 minutes form the airport.  It seems a very transient place where east is going west and vice versa therefore lacks a sense of what exactly it is.  Nonetheless it is luxurious and is well positioned.  The Pool is a magnet for most everyone ad is less exclusive than the hotel would have you believe.  The rooms are fine and the service OK but with so may people leaving and coming each day it’s missing something,",4,
"Stayed with my friend for a night. The room was really pleasant and the view is amazing (especially if you face the esplanade, the night view is amazing).  Overall experience was pretty good, the gym was great and well-equipped especially for those that are interested in fitness.  Only small bummer was the infinity pool. While it is really nice (for scenery and taking selfies) instead of a proper swim, there was the smell of puke at certain areas.",4,
"Breath-takingly wonderful. The building is so huge and spacious.  Lots of branded goods and a big food court at the basement. Stunning. Give yourself a day to visit both the Gardens by the Bay and this hotel, not forgetting the Skypark.  If you feel that you have some luck that day, visit the casino. You need your passport to enter the casino. Don't forget to bring your passport for foreigners . You get a gst refund for things you buy more than $100.  It's so easy to claim our refunds as the authorise shops will give you a receipt ,just claim it at the airport.",5,
"Booked online, process we ok. Check in was fast. Rooms were very nice, big bed, balcony was nice touch and not often seen in hotels. It is a 5 star hotel and lives up to that rating. my comments below are what stops me from rating it as the best, to their credit I guess its just too big to offer the level of service you get at the Fullerton or Waldorf.  No Door man, there was lots of guys making sure the taxis and cars were taken car of but as soon as i stepped out if the car the guys were more focused on the cars than the people and yes I had to open the door myself...   Booked a Club room, no other check in area or check in from room. Also no one showed us to the room. I understand they cant do this for everyone but normally you book a club room these things are standard.    …",4,
"Nice place but full of people just there to see the hotel can make lobby too crowded. Rooms were good, clean and comfortable. I really liked the view towards the garden can be soothing and a sight to see. Overall stay good.",5,
"I visited Singapore for the 3rd time in July this year. This is my 2nd time to stay at Marina Bay Sands and this time our stay is extra special, our room is located fronting Garden By the Bay. Wow, the light show at night is amazing.. The infinity pool is one of a kind, it's like you are swimming on top of the world..",5,
"I had the chance to stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands more on one of my favorite work-related visits to Singapore.  Here is what I have to say about this iconic architectural wonder:  Service It's just as how you would expect a big hotel would serve you.  Convenience-wise, you will get everything that you need and even more.  However, because it is a little too big, the service can be very generic and impersonal.  Design Aesthetics MBS is very modern and chic.  Every detail of the hotel and the room is well thought about.  I like the color palette and the choice of room accessories.  It really made me feel like a million bucks.  Room The room was very spacious--something I always look for in any hotel.    Location Location is perhaps the MBS' biggest advantage.  The hotel in…",4,
"Shall not dwell on the pool, everyone knows this famous infinity pool! But, I do feel it is really over-crowded. Once in a lifetime experience, yes, but I don't think that as one who hates crowd, this would be something I'd return to often. It's hard to find lounge chairs even though the pool is so long and huge. There's just too many people! But you can order food and drinks while lounging and relaxing by the pool so that's a plus.  The room was comfortable and really rather spacious. But I personally don't prefer the design, it seems a little gaudy to me. There's a study desk and chair for those who need to do work, and also a little sofa for one person by the bed and a coffee table. There's a small balcony too, my room faced the Gardens by the Bay and it was beautiful. I…",4,
We bought a ticket to the bar up in marina sands but then were told if we wanted to go to observatory deck we had to purchase another ticket.   The staff was quite rude and was not helpful at all.  Marina sands had great views but can't say the experience was very enjoyable due to rude stuff and not top quality customer sevice,3,
The spa here is amazing! Deffenitly reccomend the spa. The architecture of the whole building is amazing not to mention the infinity pool at the top! The bar at the top is expensive and the food a little boring. The pool is amazing but so many people taking photos. If your here and can afford it it's definitely worth staying here for at least 1/2 nights.,5,
"I stayed there for 2 nights in October 2016. The staff was very friendly and polite and they tried their best to deliver good service to customers. If you have a choice I would recommend staying at higher floors as views from the top as much better. Our room was equipped with the following: toiletries, towels, slippers, mini bar, fridge, hairdryer, safety box, free wifi and coffee station. Rooms are spacious and looking modern however I would not describe it as luxurious.  The hotel is located right at the marina with an easy access to public transport and surrounding attractions like shopping mall or casino. To my taste I think they provide average facilities however everything can be compensated by the swimming pool on the 52nd floor with lovely views over the marina and city.…",4,
"We stayed here on our way to Australia & New Zealand.  We've stayed in Singapore 3 times but this was by far and away the best hotel we've been to.  If you can push the boat out, upgrade to club class - Grand Club Room - extremely spacious with very comfy beds.   This gives you access to Club 55 (55th floor) where you can enjoy a leisurely breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks & canapés in the early evening which it appears some people use as their evening meal. As a hotel guest you will also have free access to the sky park and infinity pool on the roof. All the staff were very friendly and helpful in the club - special mention to Sheryl - who go out of their way to advise best way to travel/see things. The hotel is very close to the Bayfront MRT station which means you have easy…",5,
"This is a mega casino hotel.  The good is that it is efficient, has service at all hours and the rooms are large.  The bad is that it is very large and therefore impersonal.  For those that enjoy such hotels this is certainly one of the better ones.  The club suites facing the city have an excellent view and provide a wonderful night.  The infinity pool is as awesome as others have described.  The express service is a button touch away.  The room amenities are high end. 	For those who want a more personalized feel without constantly tripping over other guests, this is not the place.",4,
This is an amazing and picturesque place to be with your love. You get a full view of Singapore and can spend hours here watching at the beauty of place. The cost of entry is high but its worth to spend and you cannot give it a miss,5,
"The hotel is amazing!! Maybe something that you should do at least once in a life time. It's very expensive, fore sure, however any other hotel like this in Europe or US would have been much more expensive. The pool is the main attraction. You should stay as long as you can. See the sun goes down and the city lighting up. For those who like pictures, that's your place!  Our room was really good and the bathroom amazing. The breakfast was something unforgettable too! There is everything that you can think of! ",5,
"Went there in the beginning of November. We arrived at around 10am, the staff was very helpful and allow us to check in straight away. We were offered a very nice room on 34th floor with a stunning view of Gardens by the Bay! The view is a lot better than city view. The bed was very comfortable, room was clean, bright and modern. The pool was stunning !",5,
"We navigated our way to Marina Bay Sands from the airport using the very efficient mrt and were greeted with a very luxurious and opulent hotel. It offered super accommodation, with a fabulous view over the Gardens by the Bay. The staff were efficient, courteous and ever helpful",5,
"Yes it is expensive to stay here, but Oh so worth it!!! Absolutely amazing!!! They upgraded our package and we were so excited and happy with our amazing room! The view from the 47th floor was remarkable, looking out over the Gardens by the Bay, we could see the light show at night, and the incredible day and night time views! The infinity pool was so beautiful, and the 360 degree view from the top was so good! Only stayed the one night, but we did our last night of our honeymoon, and it was such a perfect experience and a great way to finish up our honeymoon! We will definitely be back!",5,
"A beautiful piece of architecture with no soul, content or service quality! Appalling service, poor room product (4 star like with cheap amenities), too crowded like a fish market (may take 2 hrs for check in and check out) and a list of Do's and Don'ts for the customers after paying 500 dollars per night as if they were doing some charity on us!   Check in was like as if in a 3 star hotel where u stand in a long queue, poor customer service and no personalized touches! The bellman escort to the room with luggage. No welcome amenities or even a welcome letter! Plain room interiors and bathrooms with tasteless interiors, like any budget hotel! Breakfast place was like a war zone! Can't claim at all as a luxury hotel by any means.  The only thing you could do is taking a selfie at…",2,
If you choose this hotel it is probably because of the hype of the infinity pool on the 57 th floor but what you are sacrificing is service and any personal recognition. It is so massive that the lobby is like a railway station full of people coming and going but also a lot of queues at check in and check out. There is none of the intimacy of the smaller boutique hotels where they know your name so be prepared to be treated a bit like a sausage machine churning people in and then out. When we arrived there was no porter to take our bags to reception. Instead we had to join a long queue until another member of staff took us to another area to check in. Our room was not ready as we arrived before check in time and we were told we could have a key to give us access to the hallowed…,4,
We thoroughly enjoyed our 3night stay. Spectacular views with modern & clean rooms. The staff were extremely helpful and our cleaner was very sweet leaving little surprises in our room daily such as rose petals! ,5,
"We chose to stay here as a bucket list location. The hotel is huge and is always busy any time of the day or night.  The business adds to a less than ambient lobby with people everywhere and crowding entries and exits to the hotel and shopping centre constantly. We had a mix up on check in (needing an interconnecting room for kids) which took some time to resolve and an issue with keys which were promptly dealt with. The room for my partner and I was spacious and overlooked the city while the kids room was smaller with the same view. Good side of the building to be on so that we could watch sunset and sunrise over the city. The rooms are well kept but are also very well used, not sure of maintenance schedule but must be getting close to a refurb. The shower in our suite flooded…",3,
"Marina Bay Sands  There are lot of hypes about this hotel. So much publicity generated about it and it has become an icon of Singapore. There are also lot of coverage from foreign media especially Korean about the infinity pool on the 57th floor. It is certainly the main attraction. Unique experience to swim in it. I think some of the people book into the hotel just because of the pool. Well. You are welcome just for a few photo shots to prove that you are on top of the world. After all, the infinity pool reserves for the exclusive use of hotel guests.  The location of the hotel is great. Convenient to shop and eat and travel around. However, nothing great about the room except that it is larger than most rooms in the city. The breakfast at Club 55 is good. Service is excellent.",5,
"Nice, big and very clean room with perfect garden view, unforgetable pool ,good services in club loungue, quick and early check in - all of that made our stay very pleasant. But we were very surprised  having on the big balcony relating to our club room only one chair . No small desk, no other chair for second person in the room. After our claim we obtained one more - old and not comfy chair and again no desk ....",4,
Very difficult to analyse this place as there are so many aspects to it that are spectacular! We thought everything was excellent and really cant think of one complaint. Club 55 is worth the upgrade - evening canapés are very good! Will be back soon!,5,
"My wife and I stayed here with our birthday girl last September. it's our daughter's birthday and Singapore trip was the birthday gift she requested, and a great experience for us to travel first time in SG. The rooms was spacious enough for the 3 of us, had a great view of the city too, being on top. Our girl really did enjoyed the pool so much, can’t get enough of it actually.  A bit pricey, but it’s the best gift we could give her, and it’s worth it!",5,
"When you come to Marina Bay Sands, you know it is going to be fancy and beautiful. It definitely met my expectations. I was kindly given an upgrade to a suite on the 51st floor, which was stunning and came with full sized amenities. So luxurious!  Note that there aren't many ""affordable"" eats on property. Things are very spread out (it is a huge property), so it can be exhausting to go find food options. Be prepared to walk!  Checkout was annoying, because early a.m. departures all have to check out at tower 1. My room was in tower 3, so it was a long walk at 5:45a to get over there to check out. ",4,
"Most people go to this hotel because of the infinity pool, at least this was my reason. The price tag is high but worth the stay. if you're planning to stay few days in Singapore and have a bit of a tight budget, then maybe you can split your stay by staying only 1 night at this hotel, and the rest somewhere else. one night gives you enough to see, you can spend the whole day at infinity pool which on the 57th level, it's absolutely amazing, can have lunch there and wait for the sunset. On the check out day, you can head to the pool again after having your breakfast. Of course, they have few bars and restaurants up there where you can still appreciate the view if swimming isn't what you feel like doing.    It's also worth heading up there again at night, make sure before 11 pm,…",4,
"The unrivalled view is spectacular here but you are in a very large impersonal hotel. However attentive staff help to ensure your every need is assisted. Many breakfast options although Rise remains to be the best.  Ensure to ask for a non smoking room if that's you're preference to avoid disappointment.  Worth it for the view for a night or two. Great location in the heart of the city with so much going on.  Would I stay there again, probably not as I prefer a more personal experience.   ",4,
"as one of the famous hotel that having a fabulous swimming pool, the infinity pool at 57th floor. A huge hotel complited with many restaurants and shooping malls, you have many options to visit and also it's so close to the Marina Bay attractions such as the Garden.",5,
Very bad service and seems not to care about guest satisfaction. Breakfast took a long queue to get inside because all guests have to wait like 15 mins which never seen in any other hotels in the world..strength point is their facilities and do not expect for staff's hospitality.,1,
This is a gigantic hotel that looks so much like a ship. It's got three towers and on the top is a boat like structure that overlooks the beautiful city. It has an infinity pool that is luxurious and observation deck and on the other side of the hotel they have built this most beautiful park with towering trees and wildlife it is spectacular. In the evenings there is a light show on both sides of the hotel. The rooms are pleasantly appointed and comfortable. Asked to stay in tower three I think the views are the best.,5,
"I'll just start with 2 grumbles. Although booking months in advance and asking for a 3 person room, we were only allocated room on arrival and had to get it changed as it wasn't suitable. Second, although we had paid for breakfast, they kept adding it in our bill( 4 days in fact )  so watch out for that one  The good points though are the convenient location to the shops, restaurant and Metro line and undoubtedly the infinity pool. To swim in that pool is a true experience. Unlike some other reviewers we never found it too busy or crowded. I mean what do you expect from one of the worlds best pools- you ain't going to be alone are you. Also, we did Spago for breakfast a couple of days and that was a lovely vibe.  Overall really enjoyed it and glad we chose it. ",4,
"What makes this hotel is the rooftop it really is spectacular. You have a view of the super tree grove which has a show twice each evening, the ocean with the ships and the city.   The rooms are American standard: large, comfortable, contemporary, boring. The bathrooms are clean and spacious. No bidet, towels are not soft, and the toiletries are generic.   But the rooftop really makes up for it and you can only get up there if you are staying at the hotel...   The location is very good, not walkable except to the mall next door but short taxi drives to everywhere: Clarke quay, Chinatown, Arab street, orchard...   There is a very good food court inside the mall next door.  I recommend",4,
"We decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands for the same reason most do... the pool. It did not disappoint. The pool is huge and the views from it are simply incredible. By making the pool exclusive to guests, it also ensures that it's not too busy either.  The staff at the hotel are also brilliant, they can't do enough to make your stay as pleasant at possible.  The hotel is expensive and you're definitely paying a premium for the famous pool but it was well worth it.",5,
"This establishment is known around the world and did not disappoint. Despite not being able to check in until 3.00pm it was worth the wait. The room was on the 17th floor with a beautiful view of Gardens by the Bay. It is a large hotel and maybe not quite as personal as smaller hotels but is still 5 star and deservedly so. Yes, impressive facilities but it is all down to the staff. My wife and I had a club room and access to club 55(the 55th floor).It didn’t take long for the staff to address us by name rather than title which made us feel so special. The wait staff and chefs are brilliant. Always happy to have a chat, ever friendly and polite. Whilst I can’t remember everyone’s name a special thank you to Kodies(thanks for the map and directions),Miles(a lovely lady).Sorry we…",5,
"Hotel with the best bird's eye view of Singapore's famous landmarks from your room.  Polite and helpful hotel staff. Satisfying buffet at Rise, although its getting more crowded; be careful not to bump the table next to you as the place is a little tight. Also, no bidet in their toilet's standard rooms. Hallways (at least in the 33rd floor at Tower 3 where we stay) dimly lit, or its just just my sight. ;-)  Still the best hotel in Singapore but other hotels are catching up fast.",5,
"I came to Singapore from the USA pretty much just so I could swim in the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands.  I had high hopes for my one night stay. I arrived at the property via the MRT from the airport, which was very easy and very inexpensive.  Thats where cheap ended.  There is nothing cheap at Marina Bay Sands.  I knew going in this was a high end property but wow... wasn't expecting this kind of pricing in SE Asia.  That said, I arrived slightly before checkin officially was allowed and was told my room wasn't ready but if I would pay $60 to upgrade to a higher floor then I could check in now.  So I did.  Room was nice but not spectacular.  Was on the 42nd floor facing Marina Bay.  I quickly went to explore the pool area and try to find some lunch. TIP: Eat at the pool…",4,
"What an experience!   We stayed one night there just to get access to the pool, and it was a great experience.  The hotel itself has everything you need, from gym, shopping mall, casino, and restaurants. Simply one of the best city hotels in the world.",4,
"The casino, the mall, the art museum , the skylark the spago , what can we say about the Marina Bay Sands ? a placee needs more than 2 days and nights t explore take pictures and drink your wine on the top !  Must visit !",5,
"They say your visit to Singapore will never be complete until you've been to the infamous Marina Bay Sands. This luxury hotel (MBS) certainly is an item on your bucket list that you just cannot write off -- despite ""having seen it all"" or at the very least, ""having seen something more.""  I stayed at MBS for 2 reasons. I needed to be close to the EXSA ceremony to be held at the MBS Convention Centre; and, if I had to be at work (or doing something related to my work) on the exact day of my birthday, then I might as well treat myself to some luxurious escapade.  To clarify -- the MBS experience is undeniably refreshing. But it caters more to first time visitors of Singapore, who have still so much to see, for which MBS would be a very good location to be in proximity of most of…",3,
"We reserved king-sized bedroom in June 2016 with credit card guarantee. When we checked in, we ended up being told that they didn't have king-sized bed room. Then the front desk person came up saying that room subject to availability. But here's the kicker, our cancellation deadline has passed, which means we are locked in into the king-sized bedroom whether we showed up or not. So if we got locked in on our end then Marina Bay Sands should honor its end of the bargain. How people feel paying for king sized room and ending up with twin bed room, especially with reservation made far with advance with credit card guarantee.  And when we checked in, the lady at the front desk had to do quick typing trying to ""grab"" the available room manually. What kind of archaic reservation…",2,
"If you do have some extra bucks to spend, you should definitely book a night or two at Marina Bay Sands. They have a lot of great perks to the hotel like Infinity Pool, which is pretty awesome. It can get crowded in the afternoon, but the view is definitely worth it. They also have a beautiful view at the Sky Park, overlooking most of Singapore. The gym that they have is also pretty good, filled with quite a lot of treadmills and other cardio machines. They also have a good amount of weights and other strength training machines. The room and bathroom has a great design and I definitely enjoyed my stay here.",4,
"Book for the pool and the infinity pool ! This is an giant hotel with exceptional location. You can see malaysia on one side from the infinity pool and singapore marina on the other. The pool is 5' deep. Its 450 mtrs longs but is in 3 sections. You cant swim from one end to the other. Best time to enjoy the pool is mornings ! After 12pm its crowded and you can hardly walk around or find a seat anywhere.  If this is your first time, book for 2 nights in a better category room or a suite. Most people stay here for 2 nights and enjoy just the hotel's pool and the astounding views. Ask for a higher floor room. If you do not opt for the city view room, the other rooms showcase gardens by the bay and south china sea which isnt a bad option also. I would however recommend getting a…",4,
The hotel can be easily acclaimed the best hotels in Singapore.... The amazing and worth n experience is the pool on the top of the hotel on the 57th Floor... It has a wonderful view and a complete luxury hotel...,5,
We all know that one of the best place to stay in Singapore is Marina Bay Sands. Their accommodating staff was still the same. The amenities and hotel rooms looks as it was all new. Keep up the good work Marina Bay Sands! ,5,
I have been there with my wife and 10 months old kid on 26th Nov 2016 . I arrived at 8am.in the morning and hotel staff at entrance smiled and welcomed us. I did know that check in time is 3pm however due to my 10 months old kid I had requested for early check in and then what has happened was beautiful memories...I was allowed to check in at 8am . My luggage was brought in within 10 mins. Room was so nice and tidy.. hotel staffs are so caring and friendly with us. Pool at Hotel terrace is absolutely amazing.,5,
"Where do i start? Amazing, awesome, stunning!  From the moment we arrived we were welcomed with open arms and happy faces. Check in, only took 10 mins very quick. We were in tower 2, level 40 facing the city. Our room amazing, the layout was perfect. This hotel is known for its amazing outdoor pool. I have never seen something so amazing before. It didnt matter what time of day it was, people were always in the pool. A priceless view. Now you understand why you pay approx $800AUS a night. Its worth it. This hotel is always busy you could sit in the lobby and people watch day. There are a number of different restaurant’s to eat at. I would suggest checking out Marina Bay Shopping Centres. Singapore is an amazing and beautiful clean place. I would suggest putting Singapore on your…",5,
"Very painful and frustrating experience at this hotel. Check in took 1 hr, dine in room took 52 min. And worst part is the casino. Never play there as dealers are new and don't know rules. They will call police and take your passport. No value for money.",1,
"Upon arrival, the front check in counter was quite busy, so a staff member came and took us to another check in area to save time, a nice gesture I thought.  The main foyer / atrium areas are huge, with multiple areas for having a bite to eat and/or drink and incredible views of the internal structure of the building.  We had booked just a basic room, but with a city view and was on the 34th floor. The city looked amazing at night with the floor to ceiling windows (and had electric operated curtains/blinds).  The room was very good, the bathroom / shower was great, it had a grand feel about it, free standing bath and good toiletries supplied. The beds were comfy, nice quilts and had good A/C in the room.  The infinity pool is truly amazing, Hanging over the edge looking out over…",5,
"Probably the most expensive 2 days of my 50 plus years of globe trotting  It's an impersonal  behemoth of Las Vegas proportions  and I suspect with   A good deal of Las Vegas management behind it , typical and annoying long ( American) queues for the breakfast buffet , coffee and service that is really not worth mentioning and that awful so American almond flavoured soap in the rooms .  Of course it has a casino attached to it , a big one so it's full to the brim with transient losers coming and going   Not really much to do  in the whole property , except gamble ,get lost in the huge ""all brand name "" shopping centre below it , or get blown away at the 60 th floor huge pool strip on the roof , views are great  up there but it was full full full of selfie taking Prima Donnas and…",3,
Last stop on way around the world. We stayed here for few days. An exciting place to stay. Great views great pool 57 storeys in the air and lovely room and service . Thank you Singapore for great way to finish a remarkable journey.,4,
"This is possibly the most amazing building I have ever set foot in. If your first sight of the Marina Bay Sands doesn’t leave you totally awed, then I would be astonished. With three gigantic 57 storey towers set side by side and what looks like an enormous surf board stretched across the top you are left slack jawed looking up at this building. If that image doesn’t grab your attention nothing will but when you consider that the surfboard is in fact a huge infinity pool with stunning views overlooking the spectacular Marina Bay, then maybe it’s time you considered paying a visit to this quite remarkable hotel.  Check in was quick and hassle free. You are supplied with key cards, a map of the hotel and your internet access code. The key cards will be needed straight away as you…",5,
"Fantastic hotel, just lay in the pool and see the whole city. Rooms are perfect and service good. However a little too big, like a small city, which makes it less cosy. But the pool, is an experience that makes everything else acceptable.",5,
"After arriving from the gorgeous Phi Phi Island, and excited about the things I heard regarding this hotel I was extremely disappointed. Here you are just a number! Along with the thousands of other guests.   3 towers. It takes over 48hrs to understand the layout of this hotel! We dragged our own bags up to our room. Balcony has no outdoor furniture??   The suite itself was spacious and we enjoyed it. Worked well for us. The hotel grounds and shops (which are part of the hotel) are all luxury & designer stores mostly.   The pool, we'll forget it! It was packed every time we went up! We could even get a lounge!   It's all over priced. Over populated. Given that I did come across a few staff that I felt would go above and beyond to try and make it memorable. Call me a Debbie…",2,
"Location is what makes Marina Bay Sands great.  The highlight is the rooftop infinity pool, complete with a sizeable bar.  The rooftop pool area makes for a great nighttime hangout place. The rooms are only average, and service at par with hotels of its class.  Breakfast is good, with a sizeable variety.",4,
My stay at Marina Bay Sands was the best hotel experience I have ever received. The staff are very friendly and attends to you. The infinity pool is just the most amazing thing as you soak yourself in the cold water peering over the amazing landscape of beautiful Singapore. I am so proud to be a Singaporean!,5,
"Love, love, love. What a wonderful place to stay. We had booked 2 nights for my husbands big 60, in a club room. What a wonderful surprise when we checked in we were upgraded to a suite on the 50th floor in tower 2. Happy days!!!! We didnt go below level 50 the whole 2 days. After noon tea, cocktails, breakfast all included. Pool to die for and a pool table in our room. It is an absolute must on a bucket list. ",5,
What a wonderful stay I had. I was in Tower 3 for a week. It was quiet and the room was fairly large. The view was amazing ! I must say the staff was super friendly and the people of Singapore simply wonderful.  I loved the food at Rise. I would totally recommend this hotel to everyone! It truly made me love Singapore even more !!!!,5,
"stayed at 47th floor, the view over the gardens by the bay was stunning.  the infinity pool is to die for  The service is very professional, they pay attention to their costumers details since they left a birthday cake in the room.",5,
"This the best hotel that I have ever stayed. The infinity pool provides a impressive view of Singapore city. There is a very nice bar around the pool, the staff is very friendly and the daily rates are not that expensive if you consider the quality of the place. I would say that is a must go place if you go to Singapore.",5,
"Probably the most iconic and recognisable hotel in Singapore and as far as we were concerned a 'must do'. Its 'surf board' 57th Floor, houses restaurants, bars, a viewing platform which is open to the public and  large 'horizon' swimming pools which are reserved for the use of hotel guests. The hotel looks spectacular and it is. We stayed in a club room on the 49th floor overlooking The Gardens by The Bay. What an experience.  I have attached a number of photographs of the room, the balcony and the views from the balcony. I could find nothing to fault in the room. The bed was large king plus size and was very comfortable. The room was light and airy, beautifully furnished, equipped with a coffee maker, kettle, a large screen television and a DVD player. The bathroom was spacious…",5,
"I have stayed here quite a few times since it opened and it is progressively getting worse AND more expensive!!!  The only thing this hotel has going for it is the spectacular roof top infinity pool, and now that sucks!!!  If you enjoy arriving at a five star hotel in the middle of crowds of tourists then this might still suit. Personal guest welcomes or service .... forget it!  For the money the rooms are average.  Now to the amazing pool.  Find somewhere to sit in the shade. Good luck. Brutal on a hot day. But that's not my gripe. The pool is open until 11pm so it is actually really pleasant to relax there in the evening with an expensive drink or two. But don't be there as the clock strikes 10:59. The pool staff must have a performance KPI to rush all the guests out of there…",1,
A) I want to bring to your notice about A girl at checkin  counter by the name of JULIE in Tower 1 on 1 /11 around 2.15 pm.  When I  told her that I have requested  for higher floor rooms she was extremely RUDE  and lied that club room starts from 19 floor for which I told her that I was informed by  MAIL and given gurantee that it will be    above 35 floor but rudely she said there is no gurantee only request . People like her   give bad reputation to such a grand and iconic hotel. The minute you enter the hotel for   check in you are already upset.  We were very happy with rest of your staff  mainly at CLUB 55 and a special mention for the girls ELLEN & VELLA  .Service with a SMILE that matters a lot.

"When we came to Singapore, we're so much curious about that floating boat. But then, when we came to that place, we all knew along the way that it's one of the famous attraction in Singapore. No doubt, it's very much obvious that Marina Bay Sands is such a great view to look at. Experiencing walking along the way from that place (with the view behind it which is Marina Bay Sands) up to Merlion Park is such a great once! We're very much impressed, because there's two-in-one attraction in one specific place. 😊😊",5,
"Always enjoy my visits to MBS as there are so many shops with wonderful temptations to buy!  Also restaurants galore and a great food court though a little pricey, the choice is wide. For people who wish to stay on to use the casino facilities, the Marina Bay Sands Casino is world class as well as the breath taking scenery around the whole marina area wherever you see it from!  I would definitely make time to visit if I am a visitor to Singapore!👏🏼👍🏼",4,
"The pool simply has the most amazing view. I recommend staying the night, and just hanging out at the pool, which is also open till 10 pm. The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. Service was good, however, nothing was mentioned about paying extra for kids beds. So the already expensive cost of the room, went up! The staff member serving offered some suggestions, which worked out ok. Best suited for couples and those that want to party!",4,
I thought it would be a good experience to stay there once. But I was disappointed in the overall experience. The rooms are ok but far overpriced for what you get for it. In all restaurants you have to queue. Especially for breakfast this is not acceptable. Staff overall stressed and unfriendly. The pool so crowded that you cannot have the Impression you would expect from Pictures you have seen.,3,
"Went to the VIP private bar, High quality service, quality bar and view! friendly staff and about £10 for a coke....  Well worth the visit for the view, the quality of hotel, the  infinity pool and lifestyle!",4,
"Although the hotel is architecturally interesting, the level of service and food is mediocre.  And the cost to access the rooftop observation deck is a rip off.",2,
"We stayed here for a short time during November. I am basically gonna repeat what was already said. The infinity pool is great but extremely crowded, the views are amazing. The hotel itself is huge and modern.  But strictly as a hotel, the Marina Bay Sands is not particularly good. But even though there were many people in the lobby, check-in was efficient. We were in a City-View room, which was nice. The room was huge with an amazing view over the city. But you could clearly see that these rooms get a lot of usage.  When compared with other 5-star hotels in this price range, the hotel is severely lacking service. The baggage service was slow, there is no personalization at all, no turn down service is provided and it all feels very robotic. The room is quite sterile, no flowers…",3,
Stayed here for 6 nights for a conference.  Amazing hotel.  Connected to the casino and the mall without going outside. Lots of food and bar options.    Big rooms. Great views. Great staff.   Highly recommend staying when in Singapore.   Oh and an AMAZING pool.  Don't forget to go to the 57th floor and see it.,5,
"First time in this large complex which the words can't describe adequately. Employees are very kind and helpful and Club 55 is the best place to enjoy the breakfast. Nearby big garden is wonderful and the shows by the see every Night is amazing to experience. The pool is undefeatable, never seen or experienced the pool like this. Worth every penny.",5,
"We had a great stay at this Hotel last week.  Loved the bed, the mattress and pillows were so comfortable, which is often rare in hotels.  The room was spacious and a great view over the Gardens.  The pool was amazing, as you would expect, and the staff there were attentive.  it is only at the pool that I felt as though I was in a 5 star hotel, the rest felt a little impersonal.  This is why I felt it was a bit overpriced.  I have stayed at other 5 stars in Singapore and they were more attentive.  Maybe because of the shear size of the place it was lacking something.  I am glad I stayed there, it was so convenient to everything, but also glad that someone else picked up the bill.",4,
Had a honeymoon on this hotel. Best service and the staffs are friendly. Make sure to ask a room overlooking the bay so the view will be fantastic. Had a nice cute food from the hotel as welcome gift. Make sure to explore the surroundings and all the amenities.,5,
"The short story:  This hotel is simply astounding.  Breathtaking view from rooftop infinity pool.  Great location, great staff  The Good:   - Great location. .Located in the marina area. Short walk to downtown.. Adjacent to the massive mall, casino, the parks.  Subways.. Great place for both a convention visitor and tourist as well -  Simply astounding hotel..  Unique modern architecture (the inner atrium, the rooftop infinity pool that spans all three towers with an amazing view.  - Great staff..  Housekeeping, front desk were friendly and helpful.   - Connected to the mall with an easy walk.   The less than great - This isn't a terrible thing and given the scale and size of this hotel it is to be expected but it is very crowded. There are always lots of people going in all…",5,
"Great views, great infinity pool, great restaurant options, but the room was nothing outstanding for the price paid. Room was amazingly spacious but the details were questionable, especially the toiletries which looked cheap. Since this is a top tourist attraction, elevators are always packed with tourists visiting the pool area. Have gone back and will do so again for the vista, drinks, & food; but not to stay at the hotel.",4,
"Excellent place , worth spending hours at the Top, Excellent management of such a huge system   It is over priced that is for sure,over crowded too..  Food is excellent . Excellent shopping place  adjoining to Hotel.  We stayed for 2 nights on 42 nd floor and view was amazing. Wont miss opportunity if I will get chance to visit this part of the world  ",4,
Whilst I agree that this is slightly on the higher end but it is completely worth the money. They have the best breakfast spread that I have ever seen. Their infinity pool has jaw dropping view and the shopping complex along with casino is breathtaking. ,5,
"Who wouldn't use that opporunity? As a budget traveler I wouldnt say no to any hotel for free :P But to bw honest, aside from great view and swimming pool, It bases on the look of the hotel and opinion. Rooms like the rooms, clean and ok but nothing super fancy.",4,
Me and my husband stayed at Marina Bay Sands for our honeymoon!  The food has an amazing taste with a reasonable - high price! We've tasted a lot of Asian food elsewhere but you can't get anything better than Marina Bay Sands food!  Though our baggage arrived late and at first the access to pool wasn't added to our room we eventually got these minor issues sorted and an extra as a good will gesture.  Our stay has been an amazing experience and would always recommend for anyone to stay at Marina Bay Sands! ,5,
"This is one huge hotel..... no, it's bigger than HUGE!!!!!  The draw card to stay here is definitely the pool. The rooms are pretty much like other 4 and 5 star rooms.  Negatives for the hotel   -  it is Pokemon central on a Saturday night..... hundreds of people crowd into the main foyer (where you check-in) and hunt Pokemons (no, I'm not kidding either)  -  the pool is exceptional balky crowded from about 2-2.30pm onwards and there's very little shade around the pool.  - given this hotel is so large and so popular, it is showing some signs of wear, just little things and the decor looks a little dated.  Positives  - THE POOL!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG I thought I had died and gone to heaven!!!!!!!!  This is the ultimate of all hotel pools!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved it so…",5,
"As soon as I saw the infinity pool advertised on the internet it was a 'must' to experience and it didn't disappoint. The hotel as well was amazing, we were on the 43rd floor overlooking the marina and harbour. An incredible experience.",5,
"Reading reviews, I was aware that MBS does get crowded, but I really wanted to experience the pool. Yes, it was crowded with tourists and when in the lobby, we were constantly dodging people. But, we never did have trouble immediately getting a taxi or having to wait in lines for room check in or at restaurants. We found all employees we came in contact with quite cordial and very helpful - no problems at all.  We booked a Grand Club Room, so we had access to Club 55 which was the best decision we made! We really enjoyed to food options here, as well as the view. Their drink choices are limited, but the food varied and wasn't too bad at all. We could relax and spend as much time as we liked at our table. You actually check in when you arrive and are assigned a table. You are…",3,
"We booked one night only and opt for upgrade with a small fee and was totally worth it to get a room at 49th floor.   The city view is excellent with light show from the room at 8pm right outside our window.  Pokémon trainers if possible ask for tower 1 corner room towards the edge of the hotel, 3 Pokémon stop in the room 😆  The bed is super comfortable with sofa in the room. While the bath room is huge, the tub could be a little bigger to fit 2.   The nearby shoppe provides tonnes of dining and shopping experience but a little on the posh side. We made a reservation for waku ghin and it's a dinner date to remember for a long long time.  Heard much good thing about the Rise Buffet so maybe next time we will make a trip there for a weekend brunch.  ",5,
"This is not just a normal Hotel - it's a Boat shaped Hotel. With a boat on the top of the Hotel, this already makes the Hotel unique. As the pool is part of the boat, you see the amazing view of Singapore. Nice staff, with lovely restaurants bars. Luxurious room, but the most incredible thing about it was the Pool. There were even beds in the pool. A memorable stay, with the a unique style to the magnificent Hotel. We stayed in April 2013, for my wives 40th, and re-visited in October 2016, with my mother-in-law.",5,
"Several friends recommended the MBS to us, we were sceptical, especially with the steep prices. IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY! From the moment we walked into the lobby until the moment we were bustled into an airport-bound taxi we were pampered! We didn't have the budget for anything more than the most basic room yet were still treated like VIPs. The rooms are spacious, gorgeous, and have everything you need. Room Service was a delight, and the infinity pool is spectacular.  Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in - like sleeping on clouds. Definitely make space in your budget for a night or two here, guaranteed you will spend most of your time exploring the spectacular complex. MBS goes above and beyond to ensure that everyone has an amazing time.",5,
This was my 2nd visit to Marina Bay Sands having previously first staying there almost 2 years ago.  I was super fortunate to get an upgrade to the Club Rooms in tower 2.  The complimentary breakfast at Club 55 was incredible.  The quality of food and selection exceeded my expectations.  Fiji water was a great touch.   The wifi connection in Club 55 was great as I was streaming the MLB playoffs in the morning on my iPad with no issues while eating breakfast .  The views looking back onto the ocean from the 55th floor was very special.   My room was a bit tired and could use a soft reno as the sofa was a bit beat up would have been my only complaint.   The pool as always is surreal and worth the price of admission.  My first/previous trip to Singapore I told myself I would stay…,4,
"If you want the best place to stay in Singapore, you want to stay here.  It is absolutely beautiful.  Every detail you would expect from a top hotel is not missed by management.  Staff is very friendly and efficient.  The architecture and views are amazing.  The rooftop pool and views were a great way to enjoy the views of Singapore. One piece of advice:  bring ALOT of money.  Nothing is cheap here.  There are many great restaurants and shops for every upscale taste. One way to save a bit of money, especially if you have kids, for other things is there is a couple reasonably priced shops, like 7-Eleven to buy snacks and drinks. It is definitely worth the stay for a great experience.  Hope this helps.",5,
"We booked a Club Orchid Suite on the 52 FL.  The view of the bay and garden from our room is breathtaking.  The fitness room is adequate.  Offering at Club55 was excellent, and the service is exceptional. The hotel complex has everything, plenty of shopping, dining and entertainment.    The down side is that there is no dedicated or reserved seating for rooftop pool for club/suite guests, and the pool is always crowded.  No club concierge. The Robero Cavali shampoo, conditioner, and soap, in the bathroom was too strong and masculine for use by women.  Most high end hotels use a more subtitle and gender neutral scent. Because for a woman to smell like a man cologne after shower is not appealing.  Lastly, the gaming rules in the casino is very different than Las Vegas (the rules…",4,
"Stayed at the hotel for a conference. Check in was excellent, staff very efficient. Breakfast on 55th floor excellent. Convenient for the conference center and everything around Marina Bay. Rooms very comfortable with spectacular views.",4,
"We stayed here one night during a stopover as I had watched a documentary on it being built and have wanted to stay here ever since.  I booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children which is on the 2nd floor. We got there about 11am and we were told the room wouldn't be ready until 3pm (normal check in time). So we went upstairs and used the pool. The level of service up there is amazing, everyone is super friendly. We ordered drinks and while we were swimming it started raining. As we were jumping out to move our stuff, the staff were already moving our towels and drinks so they didn't get wet. How nice is that?! We then went down to see if our room was ready so our kids could have a sleep. It wasn't as there aren't many family rooms so they upgraded us to a club room which…",5,
"Great location. Central to places like Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, Shopping centre, MRT and heaps more. Hotel staff and food was fantastic and the view from the swimming pool was breathtaking. Be it business or holiday this is the place to stay.",5,
"Stayed in this hotel for our wedding anniversary. On arriving (We were early, check in was at 3 We arrived at 12) We were seen straight away by a very professional and charming young lady by the name of Abby. She congratulated us on our anniversary and upgraded us to a Club room with a City view with access to the Club lounge on the 55th floor for complementary drinks and food. The room was fantastic, The view was Beautiful and the rooftop infinity pool was Awsome  The hotel also sent us up a cake to celebrate out anniversary (which if you'll pardon the pun was truly the icing on the cake) It's not cheap but it's more than just a hotel it's an experience.",5,
Absolutely loved this hotel and would definitely recommend. The staff were amazing and did everything to make our stay an outstanding one. The rooms were immaculate and the infinitely pool was a massive highlight. You will not be disappointed!,5,
Marina bay sands have friendly and helpful staff who are willing to assist. carry your bags when you have checking in I found people are friendly and like to chat in light conversation for those who love shopping there are shops attached or in the same building. some rooms on higher levels have great views.,4,
"There's not a lot to dislike about a stay at Marina Bay Sands.  A good hotel, with great modern rooms and some nice restaurants.  The rooftop pool is fantastic and it is in a beautiful location.  You have to be careful to not let the hotel become the entirity of your experience in Singapore though as it is a bit devoid of the Singaporean culture.  It really is like a piece of American culture in Asia.",4,
"Kept reading that this place was overrated, but really wanted to try the pool. It's the gimmick that gets people there; no swimming if you're not staying. Pool was a huge disappointment -- the infinity view is spoiled when you swim to the edge and imagine why all of the protections are in place for drunk and/or stupid people who might sit on the edge. The hotel rooms themselves are comparable to maybe a Marriott (or less) in the USA. They are far from luxurious. Lobby is a zoo. Food is all overpriced and mostly lousy (with the exception of the food court area). Save your hundreds of dollars and stay in a better-ranked, lower-priced hotel with actual customer service. I get the feeling that the five star reviews given for this property is people can't admit to themselves that…",2,
"This was my second time at the MBS. This time with my family so that they could have a chance to enjoy the pool and its fantastic view over Singapore.... and they all enjoyed it ! The location next to the Gardens is perfect for a walk or a visit, the rooms are very well fitted and the staff is very courteous and friendly. Having said that, we spent another few days in another top hotel in Singapore where the overall standard was as high and the room rate quite lower. The reception level looks more and more like an airport hall or an upmarket food court and it will not be to everyone's taste.",5,
had a great time here at the marina bay sands Singapore. fantastic hotel great locations and spacious rooms. the breakfast too was great. the rooftop infinity poolls is majestic and have not seen a better poll than this.,5,
"We did one night on arrival in Singapore at the Marina Bay and we were not disappointed.  We had been travelling for nearly 24 hours to reach Singapore and were pretty exhausted, as it was morning the room was not ready so we headed up to the infinity pool and had a lovely relaxing time, just what we needed after travelling. The infinity pool is just breath taking, just looking at the views from up there was amazing. There were nice comfy sun loungers and people coming around serving drinks it was perfect.  We then checked in to our room and it was huge with a brilliant view over the Marina Bay Gardens. The bathroom was amazing as well with a lovely roll top bath and separate shower.  In the evening we visited Rise the buffet restaurant within the hotel and it was fantastic,…",5,
"We stayed in many fancy hotels and luxury hotels, so we might be slightly fussy and demanding. Hotel was very busy during that time and on the reception level it looked like a busy shopping mall rather than a luxury place. You have to queue up to get your room, however, I cannot fault staff – they are efficient.   Our room was not high up and we had a view onto the park, which is not too bad, but the road is noisy. Overall, hotel is fine, but certainly not “top of the pops”. Swimming pool on top is the main thing and it is certainly very good. Better to avoid high seasons and stay there in low season and enjoy the pool.  So, no point staying there without the pool.",3,
"Why stay here? Normally, I don't pick a hotel based solely on their pool. But I made an exception for this hotel. The Marina Bay Sands has 3 towers. We stayed in Tower 2 was fantastic because we can take this elevator straight to the pool. If you're in the other Towers, you must take the elevator down to the main floor then hop onto a different elevator to take you to the pool area. So the pool is basically the roof of the entire hotel. It sits on top and looks like a giant surfboard. This infinity pool overlooks the entire city and the views are fantastic at night or in the daytime. The pool opens at 6am and we got there around 630am and it wasn't too crowded yet. So it allowed us to enjoy the sunrise and grab a really good lounge spot right on the water! If you come at night…",5,
"One of the best rooms I have ever had. Clean, spaceous with a great bathroom and fresh crispy bed linen. I was surprised of not having the muggy, moldy smell in the room that you sometimes encounter in countries like Singapore with very high humidity. Flawless and quite air conditioning. Room service was very quick and friendly. Stunning view and remarkable that the room had a balcony with flowers even on the 33:rd floor. Access to the incredible pool area at the roof on 57:th floor was really the cherry on the cake. The reception is not really perceived as a reception, it rather feels as part of the large shopping mall. Try out the little coffe shop SweetSpot in Tower 3 lobby area. Super friendly and quick staff and a lot of good things to choose from. If you indulge in too…",4,
"We enjoyed a couple of drinks at the Marina Bay Sands today (the huge hotel with a ""ship sitting on 3 towers"").  We paid the entry fee of S$20 to travel up to the bar /restaurant on the 57th floor and enjoyed the sweeping views over Singapore, etc. The drink pieces seem very steep at $16 for a 330ml tiger stubby, with wine around S$20 p/glass, however they rebate your entry price. It's a great view and a worthwhile experience. ",5,
"Hotel staff are friendly. Room (beddings) and the bathroom are so clean.  We had the fantastic view outside our room. Safe and secure. You cannot use elevator without your room card. Infinity pool a bit crowded then but nice. It looks scary on other's photos but once you are in there, it is not scary at all. From there, view is fantastic",4,
"It is hard to rate this place less than 3 stars but in some ways i want to - it is certainly impossible to rate it 5 stars. I went for 2 nights after spending a wonderful 5 days with my family (wife and two young children) at the Shangri La apartments and maybe had gotten spoiled. First then the great things... the swimming pool clearly is an absolute wonder and the kids loved it (at least for the first session.. then it got a bit boring as there are no nooks and crannies to explore or diving/bombing allowed!), the breakfast is good (but no where near as good as Shangri la or Intercontinental at same level), the staff are very attentive (but perhaps someone needs to train them that to be genuine and not 'highly coached' that they need to look at you when saying or doing nice…",3,
"We stayed on the 52nd floor and it was truly a once in a life time experience. Sam and Diane at checkin were really friendly and efficient, breakfast in Rise was great. Drinks on the roof top over looking the city was amazing, you do pay for the experiences in the drink prices though. ",5,
"Imagine yourself at the floor-to-ceiling windows of your 5-star hotel room, drinking in magnificent views of Singapore’s glittering city district or picture-perfect Gardens by the Bay. Or swimming in the world’s highest and longest infinity pool with its unrivalled panoramic views – a once-in-a-lifetime experience available exclusively to guests of Marina Bay Sands hotel. Infinity Pool The world's largest rooftop pool stretching 150 metres across Sands SkyPark. Accessible only by hotel guests, the iconic Infinity Pool at Marina Bay Sands offers a breathtaking city-skyline view not found at any other Singapore hotel.  This Entertainment Palace Has Something for Everyone Young & Old   From Discerning Travellers to Gourmets all Base are Covered   The Standard Rooms Are Massive…",4,
"Stayed here for a one night treat, standard deluxe room, booked directly with hotel as that was cheapest offer I could find.. room was on the 46th floor facing the city. It was longer than lower floors due to the hotels shape. You can't deny the great view, the huge comfy bed and walk in shower. Everything you need is in the room. All room guests get free access to pool on 57th floor... amazing.. if you eat/drink on 57th you do pay a premium, 1 beer approx £8.. cocktails approx £10. Top tip if breakfast isn't included got to the bakery/coffee shop on ground floor of tower 3 and take it up to the pool.",4,
"Judging Marina Bay Sands just for the hotel it self it's too expensive for what you get, sure. The rooms (we had a nice room with city view on 41st floor) are nice, clean and not to small but I would guess you could get a similar one for 100€ less per night elsewhere. They don't have rain showers, seriously (although the shower areas are really large)? The thing that makes MBS really unique and an impressive symbol for Singapore or whole south east Asia is the outstanding infinity pool at 57th floor and the small park next to it. For us, it was worth the price. However, we stayed only one weekend in Singapore and I'm not sure if I would be willing to pay for this a complete week or two.",4,
"We checkin on Thursday after fly in from HK. Upon arrival , been told the amount  is 600 bucks per night which I understand are their std rate. Turn out they charge extra if we need 2 twins bed instead one king size bed.  The final bill is 799 Singapore dollars  Overall , everything is super expensive in the hotel incl the mall across the street.   What ever the price you get from the mall or the restaurant, you can get  between 25%  to 40% cheaper outside the Marina bay sands area   Not coming back to this hotel due to cost and can't get the return of investment back except the pool   Not happy as the staff are not attentive at all ",4,
the room and bathroom is spacious ... the bed and pillows are so comfortable .... good food for breakfast ... friendly staff and the highlight of it all is the Infinity pool .... nice city view at night ... highly recommended guys!,5,
We spent the evening relaxing at Ce La Vi bar where we purchase tickets which we could use to buy drinks/food at the venue. Good service and lovely views of the city and the Gardens by the Bay at the back. Really enjoyable experience and worth the price.,5,
"Our main incentive for splurging to stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel was to swim in the infinity pool up on top of the hotel on Level 57.  And nothing disappointed about this experience or this hotel.  Yes it is expensive but you get what you pay for.  We stayed for 2 nights in a Premium room at the end of a week long trip to Singapore. The room was HUGE and the bathroom one of the largest I've ever had in a hotel with a shower the size of a sauna, a deep bathtub and lovely complimentary toiletries.  The bed was sublime and SO comfortable, and the automatically controlled curtains a particularly nice touch.  Our view was not over the city, but rather out across the Gardens by the Bay and the bay itself.  This was lovely especially at night time when the gardens are lit up and…",5,
"Great place, pool, location, amenities ... but really bad service. Not good enough for the price we paid when we stayed during a peak time -- between Christmas and New Year. The front desk staff was not mindful, a bit slow and they were not welcoming at all. Well I thought because there were too many guests ... but then it was Christmas time and that's also the reason why they charged so high. So the service must not dwindle.",3,
"Probably the most photographed hotel. This hotel has everything. Casino, infinity pool, and probably best view of any building in all of Singapore. I highly recommend going up to the Ce La Vi lounge and having a drink. It has beautiful view of the North Side of Singapore which is the downtown area and the bay area. If you care to check out the south side of Singapore which one can see the islands south of Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay.  The viewing area is around $23 it is so much better to go the lounge and put that money towards a drink or meal. I went around 4pm so I wasn't hassled about having reservations but I can imagine towards the evening they maybe more strict. Enjoy!",5,
"Lets face it travellers, we've all heard of the Marina Bay Sands or at least seen it on a magazine cover somewhere. Its a world class hotel and a definitive style icon that stands out even amongst  the modern, stylish and forward architectural landscape which is Singapore. We stayed here 3 nights and 4 days on Oct 22-25 . The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is absolutely astounding. Right from the minute your taxi pulls up to this monolithic and picturesque hotel, you get this feeling of grandeur, opulence and luxury. We'd heard from our taxi driver that yes the hotel was nice but don't expect great service as the hotel itself was just too massive to cater to all of its occupants, and also ask for a room facing Gardens by the Bay as the view would be much nicer. On this advice i would…",5,
"We stayed here for a 4 day stopover en route to New Zealand and we loved it! We had a room in the middle tower on a high floor with a ceiling to floor and wall to wall window which overlooked the bay and the view was incredible through the day but even more intriguing at night when all the lights of the city were visible. The room was beautifully furnished and decorated . It had a massive Queen size  bed ,sofa, glass coffee table, writing desk and an assortment of lights which created   different ambiences. There was also a large flat screen TV and a well stocked mini bar. The curtains were electrically controlled  and the A/c was good - and nice and quiet. The bathroom was huge too with  a double sink vanity unit, free standing bath ,separate shower room and separate W.C.…",5,
"A must if you visit Singapore - wonderful hotel, magnificent views overlooking the whole City and Ocean!  We had amazing Cocktails on the Infinity Pool Bar Deck at the very top of this hotel!  It is absolutely gorgeous with a great virbrant buzz, the bar staff were so attentive ensuring our group were never left waiting for service, the swimming pool is shaped like a boat which spans the whole length of this glorious structure - just breathtaking to have had the experience to visit'",5,
"We visited Singapore last year and decided that we would stay at the Marina Bay Sands. We arrived to the hotel at approx. 9am and we thought we'd drop our bags and explore the city as check in wasn't till later that day. At the desk the gentleman told us the room was ready and we could go straight to it much to our delight. The rooms themselves are OK, not the best not the worst. We opted for a city view room which gave good views at night and during the day. The skydeck is something else.. to be able to swim that high up and at night was very special and something that I thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel itself is quite expensive, but Singapore is and if you're travelling from far and staying a short time it's well worth the money.",5,
"I've been to Singapore many times but this was the first time I ever stayed here. And spending 3 nights in this hotel was more like a dream come true and all I ever wanted to be in Singapore became real... The hotel was so huge and everything was great. Of course the Infinity Pool is a must-not-to-be-missed place to spend because the view was breathtaking. I think all other reviews have already mentioned about so many great things about the hotel. Only one thing that disturbed me a bit, the lobby was so huge and wide but to my opinion not too impressive, and also very crowded with people...",5,
"I was last week for 5 days in the marina bay sands hotel i want to say that the hotel looks fantastic,everything clean and astonishing service. But if you come with children's this is not very good. First for each kid you need to pay 45 dollars per meal Second there isn't a lot of things to do with them",3,
