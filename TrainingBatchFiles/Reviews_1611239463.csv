"Stayed there few days back. The Hotel has a very feel good factor. The ambiance is nice. Lots of tourist and business travelers stay here. Staying here once is a must if visiting Singapore. The rooms are clean and spacious and well equipped. Rooms on the Garden Bay Side give a nice view of the Garden and Harbour Areas and Singapore Flyer. Staying on this side below floors 15 means a bit of noise from the cars moving on the road below, if you intend to open the balcony doors...else there is no noise. Rooms on the bay side give a nice view of the bay, merlion and clarke quay and business district but prefer rooms above 5 floors to not get obstructed view because of the Sands Shoppee Mall. There are plenty dinning and eating options, in the Hotel and the Mall in Front. The Top…",4,
"The location is walking distance to Gardens by the Bay and SIngapore Flyer.  It has casino, and high-end shopping stores.  Our room has a balcony but no bathtub.  It has no coffee-maker which is quite disappointing for a luxury hotel.  It has only complimentary water and nothing else.  Due to a big number of people checking-in, the standard and quality of service is not par to as expected. What makes it magnificent is the beauty of its structure.  Hope they will improve their standard and quality of their service.",3,
"This hotel is absolutely breathtaking. From location to interior design,customer services, facilities ad food. Everything you need is located near by. There is a shopping centre under the hotel. It's four stories high with every brand you can think off.  And of course the most famous pool in the world!  I can't explain that in words because it's just something you have to witness for your self! It's amazing  There is multiple restaurants up on the top as well and even bars and a night club.   You have to visit this hotel!   Enjoy ",5,
"The design and Infinity pool are two of the many things that make this an amazing property. Undoubtedly the best Hotel in SG! yes,there are so many other properties that provide good service and hospitality but the beautiful design,view this hotel offers is a notch higher.",5,
The pool....OMG it was amazing ...the hotel is to expensive for the things you get but the pool makes it worth...the rooms are clean and we had a balcony where i could smoke...the view again was amazing from the balcony....,4,
Was staying in the hotel for only 1 night because I wanted to experience to astonishing view of the rooftop pool. To my surprise the very friendly staff provided me with a upgrade from the basic room to one of the most expensive suites in the whole hotel!!! Overwhelming experience - Thank you!!,5,
"View from the hotel is unbeatable, but room rate is overpriced at min $ 600 per night. A lot of tourists and conference participants in the lobby, bars, pool and restaurant. Service is at best average vs other hotel. I would go to Macau Venetian with much better value for money for meeting.",3,
"Of all the hotels I have stayed in in the world. This takes the. Are for the most luxurious. We stayed in the two bedroom suite city view on room 55. Average price of $8000-$10,000 per night. It's was truly out of this world and I couldn't have asked for better service, room and amenities. The room itself had its own cinema, salon, private gym and spa, piano lounge, kitchen, bar, large office and two separate sleeping quarters. If you want luxury, this is the room for you. The shops under neath and opposite the hotel are fantastic. ",5,
It is one of the best things to do in Singapore.. This building is the icon of Singapore.... The service is wonderful the rooms are nice brakefast very good the pool on the top must have a visit in your life.... ,5,
"This hotel is a must do simply for the pool, it's views and a tick off the bucket list. Beside this it is pretty standard four star only. We stayed for three nights on the 41st floor. Great views - pretty much all rooms offer this. The rooms were modern and comfortable. The soaps and amenities are lovely!  First impression of the lobby was it felt like a big exposition -more like a busy airport- the place is huge and so lacks a personal touch. Even breakfast seemed like a production line where you were ushered in groups to your table instead of personally been shown to one.  I contacted the hotel several times before our arrival to arrange an early check but was told I had to enquire on the day- they were so kind enough to let us have our room at 10 am- very great full. The…",4,
"Do try to get a room as high up in the hotel as possible facing the city. We were on the 37 floor and the floor to ceiling view was awesome. The package including tea, evening drinks, and breakfast on the 55 floor was worth the money.  Yes, it is expensive. But the location is iconic. The pool is worth the price of staying at the hotel.",5,
Got the chance to stay there while on a conference. Rooms are relatively small compared to price level. This hotel is a status symbol and you see many people who stay there because it is this name. No breakfeast is served. Pool is nice view,3,
"Very cool location and attractions within the complex of the hotel. Restaurant were honestly amazing. We went to the Lift restaurant for dinner and had the buffet for lunch, both exquisite. The hotel mall is very nice and the walk to the gardens was beautiful. The infinity pool was very nice to see (packed with people though) and provides a beautiful view of the city.    My only quarrel is with the room in itself. I can understand and justify the price for perhaps the area and attractions but the room falls short of 5 star status. The bathing supplies were sub-standard(an unknown honest brand name); not of a quality worthy of 5 star hotel. The room was spacious but quite basic. No usb plug in, very basic alarm clock. The patio area was a plus though. We were lucky to arrive…",3,
"We had the most amazing stay at this hotel, one of the best we have ever stayed in and we have travelled all over the world. The front office manager, Ramesh, was so good to us on check in. He up graded us to a Premier room on the 39th floor and gave us a late check out for no additional charge. He couldn't do enough for us, he made our stay very enjoyable. The room was very big with ceiling to floor windows looking out over the city. It was so lovely at night time with all the lights. The pool is wonderful and plenty of sun lounges. The drinks and food are lovely also and the staff were very friendly and polite. Would stay again when in Singapore",5,
"Not much more to say than has already been said. We stayed for one night on our honeymoon and it was INCREDIBLE. We were upgraded to a suite, which was enormous and comfortable. The highlight is obviously the unbelievable pool, we spent the evening relaxing, swimming, eating and drinking and enjoying the amazing views. Truly worth the high price for one special night!",5,
"We stayed here for one night whilst in Singapore and really all there is to say is that it was fantastic. Having access from the pool as soon as we registered (around 11am, check in is not until 3pm) was a nice little treat. ",5,
"We stayed 2 nights here on the way home from a 4 week European holiday. It was so nice to experience top class accommodation and service after what we had become accustom to throughout other countries. It is not a cheap hotel, but we had paid more in other cities for a room that would have fitted into the ensuite at Marina Bay Sands. The views from our room on the 53rd floor were amazing day and night. I have stayed in some very nice hotels, but this is the best!",5,
"My wife and I stayed here for two nights on the last stop of our Honeymoon; we paid £594 for both nights (no breakfast was included and we had one of the basic rooms). When we arrived nobody greeted us or held the front doors open. We joined the queue to check in and then had to carry our bags to the room ourselves. Maybe you get an improved service if you book a better room?  The room was large and finished well, however it was nothing special for the price we paid. Our room was on the 38th floor and it had an amazing view of the Gardens by the Bay and the harbor. The room had an iron in which was useful after 2 weeks of travelling, but the mini bar was insanely expensive!   The main draw of the hotel is obviously the swimming pool which we went in numerous times. Only guests…",4,
"This hotel is probably the best one we've stayed at regarding comfort, luxury and location. We had the club room with upgrade and access to club55 with free beverages, afternoon tea and canapes. It was well worth it and the service received was well above all expectations. There's not much else to say than fantastic in every way! Be sure to visit the gardens, the waterfront promenade and the shoppers mall.",5,
"We stayed two nights (room 4669,  an orchid suite with city view and strait view as well from the bathroom ) in this hotel last December on the way back home after the christmas holiday in Maldives and found that there were far too many people in this hotel so that everything became uncomfortable except the room itself.   Every morning, the queue for breakfast in the lobby was miles long. We could not imagine how long people needed to wait for the breakfast. We were told breakfast was also offered on level 57 and we had it there once. Again we had to queue up for it. We waited about 15-20 minutes before we were led to a table. There were not many choices at all and each food was quickly gone due to the high demand. I was not sure whether the food cooked was not enough or simply…",3,
"This was my second stay at marina bay and as per it didn't disappoint, we stayed in a high floor on the city view side and I would recommend 👌  Many say this hotel is impersonal and it does feel a bit that way but it's a brilliant hotel that needs to be experienced if you can afford it ! The lady at check in noticed it was my girlfriends birthday and had cake sent up to the room free of charge ! A really nice stay again! ",5,
"I've stayed at MBS countless times, and each time I do, they know just how to wow me. For such a busy Hotel, they really make you feel special. They remember all my idiosyncrasies and personalise the room just how i like it. I don't have to ask for anything. The Team are EXCELLENT.",5,
"If u go to Singapore u can't skips without visiting the amazing views u can see from the terrace of this amazing building.  We haven't stayed in the hotel but they give u the option of going up the terrace and have a drink. U could pay 23$ for the skyline(no drinks, amazing views but u can't see the roof pool from there) or 20$ for the roof bar terrace (u can see the pool but not the right side of the views)  Is worthy money paying for this amazing views ",5,
"Of course it's a must-be hotel in Singapore but i can't say i was impressed. Stuff isn't very polite and doesn't care about your comfort much. They want your money, yes, but doesn't give extreme comfort back.",3,
"Great experience. Hotel impersonal but mall and surrounding gardens amazing.  Food on the expensive side on par with London prices, maybe dearer as portions proportionally smaller.  Rooms were amazing.  Someone used our room for restaurants onsite so make sure you check your itemised bills. Also be aware of scams in.the mall. I was a victim",4,
"Stayed here for a recent conference.  Has that real wow factor.  Great pool on the roof, can be hard to get a bed.  Great food at the pool restaurants.  Hotel room was great and view spectacular.   Massive foyer area and sometimes it feels like your not in a hotel, but in a shopping centre.",4,
"The MBS is quite expensive but if you are going to lash out you need to go all the way and get a Club Room facing the city.  The views are really spectacular from rooms on the higher floors. You need to be aware that having emptied your bank account on a Club Room, you are not getting any thing like the personal attention you can get for the same money at other five star hotels. You are paying for the views.  The club Room gives you the wonderful full breakfast, cocktails and afternoon tea on level 55.  You also have access to the pool on level 57. Remember this is an enormous hotel with three towers and according to advice has a 95% occupancy rate.  You have to get in early for a lounge by the enormous infinity pool, if that is your thing. The Club Room is very large with a…",5,
"Stayed there for 1 night our last night in Singapore... was worth every single penny we had paid there.  The INFINITI Pool which attracts thousands of tourists from across the world is WORTH the visit.  Its huge and can accommodate loads of people and still seem to have space.  The hospitality is very good... we were upgraded to a 2 Bedroom Suite with the view of Gardens by the Bay... just awesome and beautiful.  It was perfect.  For checking in there are plenty of counters and happy smiling faces helping out with the check in.  what else does a person want apart from a smiling person helping you out.  The breakfast at The Rise is a fantastic spread of food items right from fruits, bakery to our very own south indian delicacies.  Its an experience worth having.",4,
It was such an amazing experience to reach the top and witness the dancing lights across the city. Ill surely come back again. The view is spectacular and most of all it is a plus to have a swim with a great view.,5,
"I went to arrange a booking for a friend. Their online system had issues and they had no alternative to offer. Asked me to wait. Wow, that was quite surprising to note from a team that has to focus on customer service. The staff are not empowered and they keep repeating information like parrots. The reservation doesnt know what concierge is doing and vice versa. They keep directing you from pillar to post. Worst experience ever for over priced room and pathetic service. Never again!!!!",1,
"Most outstanding hotell We been to so far. The pool at the top, and eat breakfast next to it is a unforgetable moment.   Great surondings with casino, shopping, watershow and musseum.   A must see to all travvelers that enjoy construction, luxery and want to see something extra.",5,
We enjoyed our visit it's a nice way to see Singapore. We decided to stay and relax in the bar lounge and have a few cocktails. If you're on a tight budget-don't bother visiting. Entry fee to the skydeck and two cocktails will cost around 100SGD. I think it's worth it as a holiday treat. ,5,
"A spectacular building a great bar & pool on Level 57. very busy everywhere - large distances to cover to convention centre.  Very expensive even by Singapore standards. Internet kept dropping out, problems with keys. Do not use express checkout unless you review the bill due to mini bar. Won't be back - prefer the SOFITEL or Fullerton.",3,
"Our trip to MBS was supposed to be the icing on the cake after a 4 week trip to the UK. Unfortunately our son got sick  and had to spend 3 days in hospital in London forcing us to postpone our arrival. We managed to change our booking (costing us an extra 25% over our original quoted price). Due to flight times we arrived at the hotel at 6:30am hoping for an early check in as we had not slept for a few days and our son was still not feeling the best after his hospital stay. This was not possible, which I completely understand, the desk staff said they would email us when a room was ready. I explained our situation and asked if there was somewhere we could rest as the lobby only has a very uncomfortable stone bench to sit on. Even the cheapest hotels I have been to have a least a…",3,
"The lift took 19 seconds or so to the 57th floor, where we visited the Flight at Sky on 57, one of the bars in the hotel with a great view over Singapore.   We had to pass the reception at the ground floor. There were lots of tourists there, obviously visiting the hotel to have a meal at one of the 50 restaurants, tha casino, the musical theatre, the ice-scating rink or something else.  Look for more reviews by MulleEllum.",5,
"This is a fabulous hotel, great views, great location and the rooms and service is excellent. Roof top pool is amazing although it can get very busy and some people are quite rude . Great standard in the rooms and would hurray back in a minute",4,
We stayed for one night just to get a taste of luxury from this famous hotel. The infinity pool is amazing with excellent views of the city or relax in a hot tub with views of the gardens. The room was large and very comfortable.,5,
Definitely worthy of the luxury hotel status. The best part of this hotel however is the access to the rooftop for guests. The view of the bay from the top of the hotel is truly breathe-taking and something not to be missed if visiting the city,5,
"This hotel is absolutely beautiful. It literally is just like the pictures. Staying in the hotel is an experience in itself. Now onto the infinity pool, what a beauty. The husband and I really enjoyed our stay here, however the only downside was the food. There's pretty much no halal meat available. That was the only downside, however we're glad we got to tick this hotel off out bucket list. It really is an impression hotel and I liked the idea of how all the rooms were facing the Singapore gardens.",5,
Stayed for ITB Asia and certainly a variety of things to see and do and so convenient for the convention centre. You have to make sure you swim in the infinity pool on the top floor. So many restaurants you are spoilt for choice. Make sure you ask for a higher floor on check in ,4,
"This hotel is a major conference hotel. If you plan on visiting for a holiday, AVOID! The hotel is simply too busy. Too many queues everywhere, even for breakfast you could end up waiting for 30 min to sit down. When I stayed here, I didn't feel like I was an appreciated customer, I was just a number, one number of 1000s. And what you get for the price they charge, its daylight robbery! Not worth the cost at all.",2,
"The rooms are spacious, cleaned and well equipped. Everything you need is in the hotel. Near with many main attractions in Singapore. The staff are very friendly and always willing to assist the guest nicely ",5,
"Bucket list job, stayed 2 nights and OMG the rooms are the best, pool located on the roof top on the 57 floor with amazing views of Singapore, staff are warm and friendly. Not cheap and was glad to do it. Must do!",5,
"Everything you expect from 5* hotel, spacious rooms with amazing view, perfect service, attentive and friendly staff. I arrived 2am, got immediate check in with all information I needed for my stay. On breakfast when I was leaving they wish me a great day with my name. I asked for late check out and it was no problem at all.  I wish the service level everywhere would be the same level :)",5,
"We stayed at MBS for 2 nights on our first trip to Singapore and weren't disappointed.  The hotel is huge - great for anonymity and wow factor - with a great choice of food, drink and excellently located as a. SSE from which to explore downtown. The views are breathtaking; the Skypark is 57 floors up and affords a 360 degree vantage point including the now famous infinity pool.  Spago - roof top bar - has top notch bartenders with some of the finest cocktails ever. Fact. (Blows Raffles out of the water for service, ambience and overall experience).   If you want boutique don't go to MBS. If you're happy to be anonymous and absorb Singapore visitor life to the max then definitely check it out.",5,
"About the hotel. Excellent location. About 30 min ride on the MRT from Changi Airport (station you get off is directly connected to the hotel). There's so much to see and do in the Marina Bay area. Getting around is easy with the public transport or you can uber (not many in Singapore) or take a cab.  Service was good overall. They let us check in early at 12 noon. Casino was nice, if you've been to Vegas you won't be impressed. Do not stay in a low floor garden view room!! You could hear the noise from the freeway like you were outside. Was very surprised a hotel of this class won't be built in a way that this wouldn't be an issue. Not sure how anyone can sleep in those rooms. We were moved to another room on the 45th floor that was very quiet. Both rooms were very clean. Lots…",4,
"The Marina Bay is everything you expect from a large size 5* hotel, the rooms are well sized and the views are brilliant. It takes a long time to get an elevator when it's busy and there are sometimes a lot of people in the pool but otherwise you can't fault them. The room service food was also very good, pricey but I would say worth it.",4,
"The view was breathtaking, the restaurant at the bar was good, staff were friendly and attentive, however upon checkout they failed to tell me about the rewards card and the discounts available. Even after going back and asking them about it they said ""too late"" and they refused giving it to me. The person that refused me was Mr tomoki, besides that he took 45 minutes to give me back my card and even tried to use it without authorization. He was being extremely unprofessional... guests pay about an $700 a night and expect the staff to be the least bit service oriented. Despite the spectacular view the service didn't warrant the hotel for its full potential and it can be better. ",2,
Hotel - legend. Great place to stay when you are in Singapore. Impressive views. Infinity pool is something out of this world. The only disadvantage is it's too crowded. But I understand everybody wants to see it.,5,
This is one of the most fabulous hotels we have stayed in over our 31 years of travel around the world.  The Infinity Pool alone makes it a destination to not be missed.  But the room and staff were a 10.,5,
Great Hotel with nice staff. Very clean and functional. Many choices of restaurants and the infinity pool is breath taking! The Rooms are very nice and modern. The bathroom is very spacefull and has everything it needs. The hotel has a nice view over Marina Bay and the city of Singapur.,5,
"So we booked a room for 2 nights at MBS, mainly to check out the rooftop pool and see if the hotel lived up to the hype. Well the whole experience left me kind of disappointed. The room (43rd floor, facing the gardens) was spotless but there's nothing you wouldn't find elsewhere in a hotel of the same category. The breakfast was good, but again nothing out of the ordinary. The place is just too big to handle all the people in a customer friendly manner. The pool was nice to try for 15 minutes, but again too many people. The pool bar was full of poseurs braying about this or that. Beers are very expensive, nothing I didn't expect but it feels like the ratio of price vs what you get is too high. I came, I saw, I won't be back. There's tons of other places where you're made to feel…",3,
"I have joined my friend stay in MBS. The most attraction is the pool and you can imagine the guests are crazy about the pool and stay in the most expensive hotel in Singapore. Only the guest can access the pool area with access card. The service is really excellent, all the staff are with full of information. We have stayed in Garden View room at 21 floor. Beside MBS is the express way and i didn't get enough sleep since morning 5am by the driving car noises. But if you are one of the fun of this infinity pool, you pay whatever amount and enjoy on it, why not?",4,
"The hotel is nice and clean, but very personal and big. We stayed for a couple of nights while arriving to Singapore to shake of the jet lag and visiting the pool. It is also a good location to reach Gardens by the bay.",4,
Marina Bay Sands is the best Hotel I have ever stayed in. We had a massive suite that overlooked the Formula 1 Grand Prix race from our room. The view was phenomenal to say the least. And the highlight is the infinity pool up top overlooking ecstatic views of the harbor. Breathtakingly Beautiful..!  --A drop of ink may make a million think.  Pawan Manghnani,5,
we called that experience for 24hour @MSB where has noisy and messy lobby as well as buffet area.   Room is quite ok for two and you should give more to get high-rise room.  Pool is so noisy and almost ppls there for selfie and take pix.  Good location to go Garden by the Bay and local market.,4,
"This place was amazing!!! I really love their infinity pool and the structure of the building is really great!! I'd love to go back when there is a chance😘😁Very good location. Rooms are spacious clean and comfortable, very well equipped. The infinity pool at the rooftop are incredible😍",4,
"Situated in the heart of Singapore is the Marina Bay Sands resort. One of the busiest Hotels in Singapore but still worth the stay. The pool area on the roof is one of those things that you just  have to try / experience once. Plenty of choices of places to eat and its just a short walk to the shops, and when I say shops I mean shops the ladies will love it. if you have a layover in Singapore with flights its worth the stay for one or two nights to relax and recharge the batteries in style.",4,
This is a beautifully structured and maintained place. Loads of shopping is there for you with free water laser shows which provides the icing on the cake. On top of it the largest casino. Wow truly amazing,5,
"Wow! We've made it to the Marina Bay sands! A beautiful Suite that a beautiful staff Maria upgraded us upon arrival! It's not cheap to stay there but it's worth it! All the trendy shops around it as well. The Rooftop swimming pool is to die for! We got in eventually but the entrance to it it very bad security, not happy for a start as this security female was very rude and would take our cards 4 because the stupid machine would light up! She put us aside and no sorry or whatever as a courtesy instead of pushing us aside and not happy with this treatment as we paid a lot of money to be there and stay! The name is Angie very rude staff to be put in the front of the popular pool. We eventually got help from another male security after I told him we are a family and we just arrived.…",5,
"This is the golden ticket of luxury room and suite hotels in Singapore. Everything you want, you'll get. Except extension of check out timings because who wants to wake up at 11 a.m. honestly. Have fun and spend wisely.",5,
"MBS is a resort but yet city hotel. The hotel is a day trip within itself, from the mall, casino and the sky park. The pool on top of the hotel is a once of a lifetime experience. Very easy to travel Singapore on the subway from the hotel. MBS and Singapore is the only way to go!",5,
"Beautiful hotel, nice and helpful staff.Very good location. Rooms are spacious clean and comfortable, very well equipped. The infinity pool at the rooftop are incredible. Breakfast buffet has unbelievable wide choice.",5,
What can I say. Was a great stay. Rooms were clean. We stayed on the 50th floor facing the city. Saw part of the Grand prix. The infinity pool was amazing on level 57. We throughly enjoyed the stay. Many restaurants to choose from bit we enjoyed the food court the most at the mall next door. Also reasonably located to most tourist places which was a short can ride away. Great place to stay.,5,
"Marina Bay Sands hotel has very nice scenery from the hotel rooms. If you are going with your family and not intending to do much, the room is a good hangout place. It can oversee many of the places of interest.",4,
"This hotel charge ppl for so expensive price is due to This few reasons: 1) spacious room with a nice bay view. 2) comfortable Bed 3) easy and convinient Access to the casino and selling all the luxury goods shopping Mall (inside the Mall also have a 24hr food court).  4) high speed and comfortable elevator 5) STRONG WiFi signal (even after you exit the room, you still can Use the WiFi In the shopping Mall)  We didn't have enough time to explore all other facilities provided by the hotel, especially the swimming pool (the world highest pool on the 57th floor). I believe if really spending few days there to explore This hotel is really have Much fun (but the only concern Will be the hotel rooms price is not cheap. But If you can afford IT, why not!",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands Singapore is what you'd expect from a  hotel in heart of one of the most expensive Cities in south east Asia. Luxury and Quality in both looks and service.  My fiance and I booked 3 rooms for us and her family of 4.  One Family suite and 2 standard rooms. The rooms and the view were amazing. expensive but then again, you are staying in Singapore's tourism symbol.  The famous infinity pool however, aside from being too crowded, pool-side chairs were scarce, their was something in the water that made my fiance ITCH for a week in both her thighs and crotch area. We wouldn't have made a bigdeal out of this but after hearing a friend of ours experiencing the same thing before, we got a little dissapointed. We clearly did not expect a flaw in our MBS experience. …",4,
"I waited for my stay at this hotel for a long time, it was a dream.  Unfortunately it does not compare to other 5 star hotels  I have stayed before.  Upon arrival our room smelled very bad and after contacting to change rooms they have refused to do so and decided to send a housekeeper to spray room. ( this is terrible).  Also the AC was making very loud noises from time to time and they send someone just to look and do nothing.  I really shouldn't be getting this kind of service if I'm paying $400 a night.  Hotel is very crowded and pool is not that nice since its too many kids screaming and you can't relax.  I was planning on staying again in January for my Asia tour but I think I will stay somewhere else for cheaper and nicer staff.",1,
"Good hotel but the service is not that good, perhaps too many customer has to be served and staff seems not that attentive at all. The restaurant is excellent, the breakfast buffet and dinner buffet, what else?",3,
"We arrived at 7 am and were not able to check in, which was clear. We could go upstairs to the rooftop where the amazing infinity pool is located and could take a nap. At 9.40 am we received an email that our room was ready! Everything in this hotel is nearly perfect. The room with its view to the garden was big enough and everything from high quality. Also the bathroom with its products was outstanding. The pool is of course the best we ever saw. A trip to Singapore has to start in this hotel!",5,
"What an amazing experience.  Just the views from this magnificent landmark. Shopping experience was great for my other half. Rooms are stunning and doesn't matter which side you are on both sides are amazing. Would always recommend the 55 club option as breakfast can be overcrowded, and high tea and canapes were well presented and the service was excellent even to the point where the staff remember you and address you by name was very personal in what could be such an huge establishment. This hotel goes out of their way to make you comfortable. Extremely recommended. ",5,
"This is a must see attraction in Singapore! The infinity pool at the top of the obvious main draw. They basically have bouncers there to ensure only people staying at the hotel can enter, which means you need to bring every key with you to the 57th floor. The hotel is obviously super expensive, but if you can afford it, it's definitely a great once in a lifetime experience. I enjoyed it more at night for the views, but it can get a bit chilly up if the wind is blowing. ",5,
"I have visited Singapore for a business purpose this was a second visit to the beautiful city. however this time stayed in well known hotel of Singapore ""Marina Bay"" in my last family visit we were told by tour guide that this hotel is one of the beauty in Singapore and even people from Singapore many times wanted to stay there.  We were given a room on 29th floor however one can take room up to 50th floor too ( I guess so) the view is amazing. we did not take breakfast as an option so no feedback on the quality of breakfast.",5,
"Infinity pool was outstanding though I have never seen humans taking so much interest in themselves - hours of selfie taking. Still worth staying just to visit the pool, see the views and people watch. Every visitor needs their own room key - so make sure you each take one - security is tight at the top.  The view from the room was excellent - we had the garden view and I can't imagine that you could get a bad view in any room. Room itself was ok - not the best - clean, weak shower and too many lights on everything.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is in the perfect position for exploring the marina area, museums and casino. Joined to a mall for easy shopping and great food options. Not really my kind of place - too chaotic and noisy (mainly other guests!) - I…",4,
"This hotel was great. Clean, central to all attractions, great service. But with all the other competing hotels, the real stand out here is the pool view. Amazing. You can't compare it to anything else. ",4,
"We enjoyed 1 night at MBS hotel. Hotel staff was very helpful n gave us a beautiful garden view room at level 45. However, the air-con was quite noisy. We couldn't sleep well and we were disappointed to this. Anyway, Infinity pool view is pretty! Jacuzzi is the best! Overall, we were quite satisfied the service n environment at MBS. ",4,
"Wow, wow, wow. This was an experience. The architecture of this hotel is amazing. Best part was the pool and gardens at the top. The views of the city lights were so good. Best iced coffee S$8 in the cafe/bar on the ground floor.  The location is excellent with the most upmarket shopping within a few minutes walk. I didn't try any fine dining because I just wanted simple tasty local food. There are hawker markets within 10-15 minute walk and a food court 5-10 minutes away. There is a lot to see around the hotel.  Food in the food court was just a bit more than expected in Australia. The hotel was very expensive. Three drinks in the bar at the top was S$75. Our room was about S$500 per night.  The staff and people were very nice. One man in the street asked us if we neded…",5,
"We spent the last couple of days of our week in Singapore treating ourselves to the luxury of MBS. Compared to our previous hotel, the room was enormous, and the bathroom equally spacious. The rooms were beautifully set out and very comfortable. I shared a twin room with one of my children and the ""single"" beds were very generous in size. Housekeeping attended to our needs promptly and with full attention to detail. As guests we had a full wifi service - this was definitely appreciated. We had a room with city views - this was definitely a highlight, especially at night seeing the city all lit up. It is definitely a benefit to stay in Tower 1 or 3 for easy access to the Skypark. The Skypark and the pool lived up to their hype. Though I must say that the pool was a little too…",5,
"Visited this hotel for three nights before going to Bali mainly for the infinity pool and other amenities, I will state some of the pros and cons for us: Pros: Infinity pool amazing, definitely a bucket list item.  Lovely large grand club room. Nice complimentary canopies and drinks every afternoon for three hours. Very attentive and helpful staff especially Codies and Shawna at Club 55. Efficient check in and check out. Good location.  Cons: Very expensive drinks/food approx £10 for a small glass of wine and £10 approx for half a lager!! Don't get me wrong we expected to pay as this is an iconic hotel and I don't mind paying but I felt that this wasn't justified, felt as if we being ripped off!  Internet was slow and patchy, you had to pay for the faster one!  All considered if…",3,
"The hotel itself is a destination.  The pool is a must and there are a lot of choices for food.   Too much high end shopping and nothing to very few for people that stay on their ""normal"" rooms.  The rooms itself is comfortable, I stayed at a king deluxe, the ""cheapest room"" at about $400 usd a night.   Room is very similar to a 5 star Las Vegas room with automatic shades and all the automated lights.  Very comfortable with a great view at the garden by the bay.   But the pool! Let me tell you about the pool! It's just amazing.  Beautiful view, i had a great day with not so many crowds.  Went on the day wait for sunset and see all the night lights from the city shine!  I'll post pics when I transfer from my GoPro.  All in all, it's a great stay with ONE MAYOR DOWN...: the…",4,
This place was fantastic! Only had the pleasure of staying here 1 night but was an amazing experience! The pool was by far the highlight with jaw dropping views of the Singapore skyline something you won't forget in a hurry. The service was phenomenal but that is expected in a very expensive hotel. Overall this was an amazing hotel and well worth the price.,5,
"This hotel is an industry, not an accommodation. We stayed here for one night, in June, and even though I cannot say is the best hotel I've stayed in, it definitely worths a try.  From the moment we've entered, we were amazed about how huge and crowded this hotel is. There were queues everywhere: at the reception desk, at the breakfast place in the lobby, at the elevator. But everything went smoothly. We received the key to our room even though we have arrived early in the morning, way before the check-in time. The room was big, clean, nicely decorated and with all the amenities needed. It had a balcony facing Gardens by the Bay. Hotel provided complimentary bottles of water, but, on the other hand, the minibar was locked and in order to get it opened, one would have to pay 10…",4,
"We are currently staying here and we feel sick due to the amount of money we have wasted. We are so incredibly disappointed. We are here for 4 days on our honeymoon and have looked forward to staying here for years.  Upon check in, our room STANK of old stale cigarette smoke, it was revolting. We called to be changed and were told that housekeeping would come and spray the room to rid the smell because the hotel was fully booked. Only after a second call and my insisting that we be moved, we were moved 10 floors lower (disappointing, but at least not stinking). The housekeeper who moved us was lovely, which was nice.  Our current room, is completely outdated, the carpets feel filthy under foot, the furniture is basic, it is completely underwhelming. Not to mention that whenever…",1,
"really worth every dollar! we stayed there 2 nights in premier room with garden view, the pool is as amazing everyone says and you can see , only hotel guests can go into the pool which makes it really relaxing as it not so busy",5,
"The hotel is amazing! One of the best I ever stayed in! It may give you the impression it is not personal due to the fact that some areas are open to visitors but it's in fact only floor 1 and observation desk. If you are a guest at the hotel you won't see the people in the observation desk when you are at the pool and floor 1 you'll use mainly to leave the hotel so no problem with the crowd.   The rooms and bathrooms are amazing, great areas, top quality, much better than other 5 star hotels in Singapore, with the very important plus of having incredible views - in our case over the gardens by the bay.  I truly recommend you to stay here if you come to Singapore! And don't be mistaken, this hotel is much better than the most 5 star hotels although rate in booking is not so…",5,
No words to explain my stay with family in Marina Bay Sands in super deluxe room.  The hotel is awesome.   The room was quite big with all facilities that one can think of.  The best attraction was infinity pool at top.  One should definitely stay in this hotel if visiting Singapore.  No more words as experience was unexplainable.,5,
"Even though Marina Bay does not need my propaganda here, as it is a worldly acknowledged hotel, be sure that I will always recommend the place to friends, peers and family as a “must go and stay”! Not only the place is just magnificent, but the staff is uncommonly helpful. Absolutely no complains about anything. On the contrary, every inch of the hotel brings a pleasant surprise. The rooftop infinite pool, the several restaurants option and services… top notch! Even when I lost my cellphone somewhere in Singapore (out of the hotel), the staff would not rest until they found the phone. And so they did it, and kept contact with me even after I left the country. Amazing!!! I will definitely be back!!!",5,
Hotel is just awesome...it has 53 floors...and on the top floor there is swimming pool..to access this floor u have to pay some cover charges,5,
"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights to end our honeymoon and I was incredible!  Everything is very expensive, but you expect it when you see the scale of the luxury at this building.   A place that I will certainly never forget",5,
"This is easily the best hotel that I have stayed in so far... Not only do you stay in the most iconic building in the city, you get amazing rooms with sophisticated equipment, breathtaking views from the room and very friendly and efficient staff. Bottom line, the best in class!",5,
"We stayed in this ""hotel"" 4 nights and we sooooo regret it. Horrible experience: crowded, very poor standards, terrible service. It was our first time in Singapore and we almost left after 2 days in the hotel.   Staff was so rude especially on the terrace / swimming pool: we were with our 2 years old baby and the staff insisted for us to pass the badge while we were holding our little one and had other personal belongings at hand.   Also despite the pool view being just amazing the standard is horrible. Flipper and pads were literally floating on the pool in some areas. Oh boy!!!  Other point that is totally the hotel responsibility do not let people in bathrobes wondering in the hotel it is just not classy if you pretend to be a reference.   I will stop writing as I am getting…",1,
"Go for a room with a view and you'll spend half the day at the pool, and the other half in your room, speechless, looking at the bay. We were given a room at the 44th floor. The city is right in front of you and the highway runs under your feet. The huge bathroom and extremely comfortable bed are all you need after a day of taking selfies in the pool. The breakfast buffet is great, the casino is impressive, and so is the SkyPark, and so is the staff. After checkout, you get the great feeling of crossing off another item on your bucket list.",5,
"I’ve just not known where to start. Three days stay in the Marina Bay Sands hotel is something I would relish for whole life.  It is easy to get around Singapore on the MRT and it stops directly at the hotel – just make sure you get off at the right stop, you need Bay Front not Marina Bay. I checked straight in and was given the choice of a double room on a low floor or a twin room on a higher floor. The hotel is split into three towers and I was in third tower & 41st floor  I sat in the room for ages, everything was amazing, beautiful room, a hotel complex even bigger than I imagined and a mesmerizing view of the city from every corner of room.  I made my way up to floor 57 and saw the pool, it was incredible beyond words. The views from this height are stunning, you could see…",1,
"We booked an Orchid Garden View Suite on the 4th floor to fit our 3 young kids, and were upgraded to an Orchid City View Room on the 46th floor. Check in staff met us at our transfer limo, escorted us straight to our room to check in. No queues, no crowds, no waiting. They knew who we were before we got out of the car. Nice.  The room is very large. Sitting room and dining room in one, with its only toilet. Then the bedroom. Double the size of a normal room. And the bathroom with elegant free standing bath, huge shower (albeit could do with a better shower head). Roberto Cavalli toiletries is a nice touch.  The Club 55 privileges are outstanding. Breakfast, frankly, not as good as Rise, but quieter and outstanding view. But the afternoon tea, and also the pre-dinner canapés were…",5,
I cannot endorse pying a little extra and getting a club room of suite just for the evening canapes and drinks on the top deck at Club 55. I would have given it 5 stars but during my stay we had a few dramas with entry to the skypark infinity pool which made us waste 10 minutes each day to rectify this situation. other than that the staff are friendly and the food at the buffet is great,4,
"We stayed here for 5 nights, we were upgraded on arrival as they didn't have the room we booked available, no complaints!  The suite we stayed in was to die.  The infinity pool is spectacular.  If you don't mind LOTS of people then its fantastic.",5,
Loved the view from the top...was told buying a beer will gives you access to the top floor and it was spectacular!  The design of the building is unique and very special in many ways!was close to my hotel and its good to see something we always want to try and feel it,5,
we been in singapore for only 3 days and 2 nights we spent here at this hotel! i loved everything ....the famouse pool was not that great cause it was very vindyyyy and u coudnt stay there and relax...it was just for a photo! i dont know if i would return on it but the one experience was very nice!,5,
All the staff is very friendly and supporting. The second day already the waiters in the Restaurant were remembering our Name. They are trying to fulfill all the expressed and non expressed wishes.  Negative Points are. during Peak time it may happen that you suffer from Long waiting time during check in and check out. If you are booking a room of a certain price Level then you are allowed to take breakfast at Level 55 Club (with nice view). But even with room rates of about 600 $ a night it might happen that you have to que in for 5 or 10 minutes to get a free table. But bottom line: all the highlights are much more relevant than the few lowlights.,5,
"Stayed in the premier room with balcony overlooking the supertrees. Beautiful sight at night when the supertrees are lighted up. Fab infinity pool, good to experience once. The room we stayed is spacious with a nice bathroom! Staff are fabulous and took the time to chit chat abit with us. The gym is not big but nice city view when you're working out. Food at the Rise restaurant is always good. Love the cakes! Casino is huge and we had the best of luck he he ",5,
"The Luxturiest hotel I've ever seen, it's like a heaven, you will never forget your memory that you have spend this lovely place💖 Modern and Luxtury together make it unlivable, you can not imagine how great is it",5,
"Before arriving at Sands, you can experience all the majesty of the building from the Bay, or from the Gardens! Inside it, at the lobby, a different experience, with lots of people taking photographs, walking across the hall, buying at the many stores avaiable... when I was at this hotel, there was a musical presentation, simply amazing!!!",5,
"Enjoyed my stay, but it is expensive compared to other properties in Singapore. Good Location, great view ( city view is better ) Check in was a hassle at 11 am ( huge amount of people departing at same time )",5,
"In August 2016 I stay at the Marina Bay sands for 5 nights in the Deluxe Garden View Room. The reason I picked to stay I was a fan of the architecture the proximity to the MRT, Gardens by the Bay, and celebrity chef restaurants, and of course the iconic pool.   When arriving from the airport I was blown away by the number of people checking in. However, everything ran like a well-oiled machine. The wait was minimal. This was the first glimpse of the scale and size of the property. For some reason, I was expecting to walk up to an empty check-in desk.  The room was very clean and modern, and the bed felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. In fact, the bed was the best hotel bed I have slept on period. I also appreciated the small details such as the shampoo, conditioner and body…",5,
"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands Hotel in June 2015 for Honeymoon. Loved it there, Booked the Members club room, which was worth it. Special check in area which was quick. Had access to member lounge for breakfast and canape's in the afternoons. Room was beautiful and very large. Room had views of the gardens by the bay and would watch the displays at night. Hotel was huge with so much to do there. Pool was amazing. Hotel close to heaps of tourist attractions in the Marina Bay area, such as gardens, art science museum, and night time water show. Plenty of shopping nearby. Thank you for a great stay Marina Bay Sands.",5,
"A Vegas-style hotel (Casino included), more suited to American and Asian tastes than Europeans. Anyway, I recommend everyone to stay, at least because is in itself the undisputed main tourist attraction of Singapore, especially by its amazing (and justly famous) rooftop pool. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, although I found its decoration a bit old-fashioned, especially when compared with the ultramodern design of the whole building. Obviously you will have the best views from the upper rooms, but the lower ones that look to the garden also offer pleasant vistas and are less expensive. The staff is not particularly nice nor efficient, but in these overcrowded hotels this is quite common.  The breakfast is absolutely pantagruelic, but when you book a twin-room on a b&b…",4,
"The building is incredible, and the pool area is just sublime. Room was good size, but for such a modern hotel hadn't really been thought out that much - eg no power sockets next to the bed, plenty of sockets other end of the room but not good if you want your phone charging next to you when sleeping. Hotel did seem to be very much geared around making money and as a guest you were just part of that, just a number, not made to feel individual. Also, and may just have been a personal experience, it didn't seem to cater for a single person, the restaurants seemed not to want to give a table to a single guy, but would have been happy for a couple. Happened a couple of times in different places in the hotel which made me think it was not a one off event. Given it is a business hotel…",4,
"Awesome pool , great view great restaurant SPAGO . I didn't stay at hotel just went for lunch and drinks , great host Lucas the bar manager gave me a lot of info of what to do in Singapore, would definitely stay here a few nights in my next trip ...",5,
1st time in SG and this hotel is awesome. Great location stunning views and fab food. It's on Bayfront station and SMT. Makes it easy to travel round SG. 3 huge towers with a swim pool on 57th (top) floor of Tower 3 which is an incredible experience . If you can afford it this is the hotel to stay at! But it's expensive!,5,
"Worth a visit.  Stunning hotel with lots of places to eat and drink.  If you want to go to the viewing deck there are 2 ways to get there.  Either to out the doors at the very end of the hotel, opposite end to reception, turn left and go down the stairs to the left and pay for the viewing deck only, this looks towards the city and the sea.  Or you can go to the lifts just inside that same door which has a sign on it saying ""de ja vu"" and you can go to the bar or restaurant and buy a drink or meal to view.  You can't get to the pool that I am aware of as this is for the guests only we were told.  It's a fantastic view and worth the experience as you see most of Singapore from up there.",5,
"We stayed here at the end of our month travelling Malaysia and Singapore. We decided to stay here for one night to treat ourselves to a night of luxury. The room was absolutely stunning and had great view of the Gardens by the Bay. Tv with loads of channels, huge bathroom with a bath and large shower. Very friendly staff, waiting to great you and take your bags. We also want to thank the lovely Thai gentleman who showed us to and around our room, he gave us lots of recommendations and was very friendly. The best part was spending the day at the rooftop pool. Perfect place to watch the sunset behind the city skyline and have some singapore sling cocktails. Worth every penny! We will be back!",5,
"i had an amazing 2D1N stay in this hotel, loving the infinity pool with a superb cityview of singapore. As a singaporean myself, i still simply love the city view and enjoying it especially at night! The services were very good and the restaurant (RISE) provide a wide range of foods in the breakfast buffet and it very good really! Stayed in the premier room and with a nice bath tub and i got a room for the garden view. It was just as nice as the city view. The gym was at level 55, tower 2. The facilities there were just super great!!! Wish to go again! Highly recommended!!!!!",5,
"Everything is BIG even the price.   You need to experience this hotel at least once in your life and I did it. To get the lowest rate book MBS at least 3 or 2 months before your stay. I've waited for a promo price but I ended up booking a higher rate as the days nears.   Gifr or souvenir shop at the Lobby just before Tower 2.  Biggest room in Singapore, I helieve.  but sorry to say that the room in Venetian Macao is far elegant ang bigger & at a better teasonable price.   Infinity pool on the 57th flr. Each guest per roon woll be given a card key access to your room & to the pool.   The Casino at the basement. Bring your passport.  Food court is at the pther side far end basement lots of variet to choose at Affordable price. Try your luck in slot Machine.  Thr Shoppes - all…",4,
"I was only one night at the hotel, but everything was excellent ( the service, room, view, infinity pool, dinner). Fantastic view from roof top swimming pool and deck area. The view from my room was great as well (we got the room with garden view).",5,
"The hotel where is everyone know where it is with super view. It is incredible high. The room was nice, clean but kind like same same with many other 5 stars hotel, nothing much impress. The staffs were friendly  and helpful . Thank you",4,
"This hotel doesn't need any recommendation , it is really fantastic. It was big fun for us to stay in one of the most interesting building on the world. We came to Singapore after 2 nights on the plane and we only dreamed about it to sleep. It was 11AM and check in starts in MBS on 3PM. We read in TripAdvisor that there is no chance for early check in and it was a big surprise for us when we received our keys without any problem. Beds were very comfortable, probably the most comfortable we ever slept in hotel. Also check out was very fast and well organized. We got the best room for the price, on 16 floor with magnificent view of the Garden on the Bay. In MBS is always something to do around. Of course it is greatest roof pool where you can feel like in the beach resort. Bars…",5,
"You have everything in this complex. The suites are good, the hotel is very big but it does not disturb much, because the service is good. The location, the view, the restaurants are magnificient. A good place to stay.",5,
"This was the ending to a 4-week long SE Asia trip. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The breakfast buffet is the best and largest I have ever seen (for a price, of course), offering both Western and Asian foods. The scenery from the Infinity Pool is breathtaking and the Gardens By The Bay is also worth a visit. I guess you get what you pay for, definitely worth the experience but it's enough to just experience it once.",5,
"The hotel itself is just like any other high-end hotel. Their service was good but nothing extra ordinary. The only reason I stayed here to check out the swimming pool on top.   Pros: 1) Fantastic view from roof top swimming pool and deck area. 2) Staffs were very cordial, after requesting they have upgraded our room to the 43rd floor. 3) The view from room was great as well (we got the room with view of city) 4) The room was in great condition.  Cons:  1) The hotel staffs were too busy to serve you with care (in swimming pool and the lobby area). 2) You wont get enough attention as opposed to the amount of money you are paying for room and other services. Value vs Money is not good.  3) If you are going for breakfast in the hotel, the the rate goes up a lot. This does not make…",3,
I visited Singapore and this Hotel only to see the Super Trees and not disappointed. I opened my curtains to see them in full display I was so excited to think I could walk onto my balcony and watch them change colour.  My room was pretty ordinary and disappointing.  The pool on the roof was backed as you also have tourists paying to use the pool area. It is not just for guests.  The breakfast was good and plenty to choose from.,3,
"If you like over-the-top, eye-catching architecture and constant commotion, this is the place for you.  The hotel is a destination in itself.  Happily, its brash style is accompanied by an excellent staff, immaculate and sizable rooms and good food, especially the full-on buffet breakfast in the lobby.  A modest storefront alternative, The Sweet Shop, is easily overlooked but is actually a great choice for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Tip:  We loved an ocean view room so we could watch all the cargo ships queuing up for port.",4,
"I was really looking forward to staying here but, in the end, was completely underwhelmed.  The hype is bigger than the reality, or, never mind the quality feel the width.  The two big things going for this enormous zoo are (1) the enormous horizon-edge pool and decks on the 57th floor which require your room key to access, and (2) the bars and viewing decks on the third tower open to the public.  The subterranean casino could be anywhere.  I took a Club Room on the 42nd floor.  I was on a business trip.  I still had to pay extra to go from slow to high-speed internet access, which I thought a bit rich for a room that was already costing S$800/night after taxes.  This non-smoking room bore the stale smell of an earlier smoker masked by cleaners and disinfectants.  The room and…",3,
This amazing building is a must to see in Singapore. The building is even more impressive to see in real life with the different shapes and the  large boat sitting on top of it all. One of the best views in the city.,4,
"If you have some money, go for this hotel for one night and enjoy infinity pool with good meal and drinks. We stayed in Deluxe room with orientation for gardens. If you can, pick city skyline or premier room, which are higher. There is a highway under deluxe room windows and cars can be bit noisy.",5,
"I came here with my son on his vacation and he enjoyed it so much..everything are perfect here..the reception upgrade our room, concierge are very helpfull to maintain our lugagge..the room is unique..we can see whole singapore from here..in night we can see the flower dome and a lot of lights shining around the hotel. Its also very close to MRT marina bay. The only thing is the price of the room is too expensive i think and also the breakfast also too expensive..another are perfect",5,
"Our arrival at this hotel was very disappointing. We were herded through the checkin process as a body in a room -not at all personal or friendly. We discovered on day two that we could have used the dedicated club room checkin counter but none of the staff advised us of that on arrival. Thankfully, the staff in Club 55 are friendly, efficient, courteous and helpful and called us by name at all times and made us feel extremely welcome. The facilities in Club 55 are fabulous and the views are to die for.  The food and beverages on offer were delightful as well. The Skydeck is amazing and we spent many happy hours up there (the staff who monitor the gates to the pool area are quite officious - maybe a lot of people push their buttons? but in customer service you should always have…",5,
"The best day of my life, I was there just one night because I had to take the flight the day after, but I really enjoyed all the day especially the night in the infinity pool with al the view of the city's lights. Amazing experience ",5,
"Stayed here with my partner for 4 nights. The rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. The location is good and there is plenty to do in Marina Bay and it's a quick train ride to the city. The pool and sky deck is outa this world and the views from the rooms and sky deck are amazing! You need to experience this resort at least once in your lifetime.  The only negative that I have was how commercialized it was and the lack of personalized service like the opening of lobby doors and having to bring your own bags up to the room. Considering what you pay to stay here, I would expect those two things to be done for you. But we had a great time and loved every minute! Would highly recommend the stay!",4,
"We stayed at Marina Bay for 2 nights i.e. from 13th Sept 2016 to 15th Sept 2016. We had booked 3 rooms. We were travelling with kids (all around 3 yrs old) and hence had a good amount of luggage with us. Right from the time we got down the staff complained about the quantum of luggage.   Check-in was smooth and we were provided 1 room out of 3 despite of being an hour early than the stated check-in time (which is reasonable and acceptable).  Luggage for all the 3 rooms was delivered to the 1 room provided (which was ok as the room size was big).   We wanted to feed our kids and so we called up rooms service asking for 5 plates, spoons, forks, bowls etc. We were told that only 11 items can be delivered to one room in a day anything above that is chargeable. Isn't that horrible!!!…",3,
"I have treated myself to a night at this hotel and it has been well worth it! Having read many reviews about poor check in and service, I can honestly Say that I haven't experienced any of these. Pool not too busy and staff very attentive. When people complain about price...they chose to book at this price so I don't understand how they can complain about it? Views are one of A kind and well worth it! My room is very large with a fantastic city View and I was given early check in at 12. I have stayed in many nice hotels and highly rate this one! Another reviewer complained about lack of umbrellas and shade, however they would definitely obstruct the view so I can see why they don't have any. Treat yourself and book now. A special mention to Crystal and her attentive pool bar…",5,
"Ok so when choosing the MBS, your staying there for either the infinity pool or the casino, not for a 5 star hotel experience. Once you get your head around this you can relax and enjoy which of these your came for.  We stayed in late September so we could relax by the pool and take the obligatory selfies. Check in was fairly slow and took us about 15 minutes. We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival in our room on level 49, the view out over Singapore is absolutely spectacular, likewise the room is one of the largest standards that I have come across.   The curtains open automatically when you enter, and the room has a separate lounge area with it's own TV. The bathroom is also very stylish and spacious, although we were put off with the cheap looking Chinese toiletries…",5,
"Expensive hotel that gives nothing to you, but a wonderful swimming pool. The hotel is crowded as itself is a landmark in Singapore. You have to face lines for check in and check out and to take the elevator. The lobby is always packed with people, many of them wearing their robe!!!. Rooms are small but clean and comfortable. Don't ever forget to take your room keys with you. If you are not with them (all of your people's room) you cannot access the pool area or the gym - even if you just want to cross from tower 2 to tower 1 to go to the restaurant. Hotel staff is very intransigent about that and we had to go downstairs and pick up all of our keys because we were not allowed to cross the towers by the pool area.   There is not a playroom for the kids.   That being said, you…",3,
"Stayed for 3 nights- 3 rooms, 6 people.  Summary of experience:  Positives 1. Great pool, good view 2. Room service was efficient, quality of food was good  Negatives 1. check in took forever- i.e. over 40minutes, no welcome drinks and loud live chinese orchestra playing at the lobby 2. quality of rooms were mediocre at best-nowhere near international 5 star hotels so manage your expectations.  Beds were portable (had tiny wheels at the side), toiletries were stuff you'd get from a convenience store.  The toilet flush is hidden behind the toilet cover so you'd literally have to put the cover down every time u wanted to flush- bizarre.  The shower cubicle only had a 1960s shower head fixed to the wall- something you'd expect to see in a Bates hotel. 3. Went to Rise for breakfast…",1,
I had a short stay of 2 days and I would say it is the best stop in Singapore. Check In was quick .. room was spacious .. and the pool in the 57th floor is out of this world. Great Service and Excellent Staffs,5,
"Spent two nights at a club room in tower 2 - MBS is as spectacular as you expect! Check in was flawless-we even got our room at noon and received a late check out until 2 pm. Considering the 2500 rooms to serve the lobby is very busy but service was great. Infinity pool is spectacular but gets busy with visitors taking selfies at times (especially sunset). Not a quiet, romantic hotel but has the wow factor. Even got a cake for my birthday. Club 55 lounge was busy but great views and food/drinks. Elevators really fast. Definitely need to stay here when in Singapore!",5,
"One night in this hotel is a must in Singapore. The pool on the 57th floor is the perfect illustration of man's immoderation: what a unique feeling to contemplate the town from the water! Rooms are very comfortable, in a pure American furbishment style, and with huge bathrooms. Staff is very helpful, and make stays just... perfect.",5,
"My first time here and all I can say is quality! The service was exceptional; check in was quick, and because I was celebrating a birthday the lady at reception was kind enough to upgrade our room and put us on a high level. Then we had David Cheng bring our bags to our room promptly after check in, went above and beyond by taking time to suggest a few things to do during our stay, and happy to answer all our questions.  The infinity pool was amazing, and very clean.  I also received a nice surprise in my room after coming back from the poolside- a birthday cake!! (And they had also tidied our room during that time). You definitely pay for what you get here. Will definitely be back !!",5,
"When you arrive it feels like there is a personal welcome from the bellman, as he takes your luggage and welcomes you to Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There is a long check in line, we arrived at about 12 pm and was told our room would not be ready until check in at 3pm. That's absolutely no problem considering there is so much to do, we took time to explore this massive upscale mall. Stores included Luis Vuitton, Hermes, YSL and Miu Miu to name a few.We had reserved the room for 2 persons, but quickly found out Marina Bay Sands wasn't playing any games on room occupancy. We quickly got cute for the pool since that was the whole reason for being there. We took our two room keys to the 57th floor and saw immediately there is security awaiting each person to swipe in with their own room…",5,
Beautiful hotel with beautiful concept! Really loved the view from the hotel and especially the rooftop Swimming pool and there is a bar too. Ambience is excellent and the scenery is perfect from the room.,5,
"Though I've been to many luxurious hotels around the world, but have never been to a better hotel in a other metropolitan city anywhere in the world. Service, staff and accommodation are simply top notch. Never the less the adjacent mall ""marina Mall"" offers the widest variety of fine dining restaurants in a single spot plus all the high end fashion shops and watches boutiques. Never had a better shopping options anywhere else. I've stayed 5 nights in the hotel and tried the most famous restaurants during my stay and it just blew my mind.",5,
"This hotel sells with exceptional pool area and it really is amazing. The view is absolutely stunning and all plantation and restaurants make it even better than expected. Towel service and number of sunbeds is great, pool side service works well too. Despite of large number of customers, all works quite well there.  We had deluxe king bed room in 43rd floor with sea view and small balcony. It had great view to sea and garden by the sea. We have seen city lights of Singapore, so we recommend to take high floor sea view before low floor city view. The room was large and actually better than we expected. Bathroom, bed, etc. were good. The small balcony was a plus to open and enjoy the view.  The rest of the hotel is like any good large hotel with lots of tourists. Late checkin at…",5,
"Stayed here in a bay suite with my sister and brother in law , they had been before and it did not disappoint again. The suite had two bedrooms and a large lounge all with stunning views  Everything you could need was here and the butler service was superb  They surprised us every night with different treats ( I won't put on here what ,as it would spoil the surprise if you come )  The food was amazing , with a good selection at breakfast and also the early evening, very filling ""snacks "" , They offer you champagne as soon as you sit down and don't stop topping it up !  Afternoon tea is also included in the package ,with a delicious cake selection The chocolate , was the best I've ever tasted  The spectacular rooftop infinity pool is amazing and especially at night when it's warm…",5,
"I have been travelling for 4 years and got the chance to be in different hotels all over the world, and haven't seen anything like superb hotel like Marina Bay.  This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy.  View in the Infinity Pool is amazing. Guest Services are warm-welcoming and friendly.  Will definitely coming back...",5,
Marina Bay Sands is a really good hotel but what makes it outstanding is the infinity pool right at the top. The views are phenomenal and one could spend a lot of time there (like we did!). Breakfast was decent and the connecting shopping mall is pretty good albeit mostly designer names which we don't really care for. There's a good food court and a DC superhero cafe which is a must see for superhero fans!  Staff at the hotel were courteous and efficient. Hope to stay here again!,5,
"The overall of the hotel was amazing. Facilities, pool, mall, etc. The only problem was the afternoon that we went to the pool, it was crowded. But the view there is very nice. You can see the whole singapore (almost).   Hope to be back soon. ",5,
"We were here on business and for that reason it did not disappoint.  Everything you could ever want is here - it's like being in Vegas.  High end shopping, tons of restaurants and a very, very cool rooftop pool.  If you are looking for all that, this is your place!  If you are looking for something with more local flavor and boutique style, then go elsewhere.  We visited Raffles and next time I would stay there.  That being said, if you are here on business it has everything you could possibly need.",4,
"We booked this hotel because we knew we wanted to visit the famous pool and take in the views from the MBS.  We stayed for two nights.  Maybe due to over researching I was quite nervous of our stay as there are divergent views on what to expect of this hotel.  First disclaimer is that we stayed in the Orchid Suite and had club access.  This might make our experience different from others.  We arrived around 4.30 pm and proceeded to the dedicated check in desk for suite guests.  I had several back and forths with reservations prior to our visit.  I saw a youtube video from a fellow traveller of an orchid suite with a spectacular view from both the living room (the marina, Merlion) and from the bathtub (Gardens by the Bay).  I requested either that room or a similar room on…",5,
"We decided to stay at this hotel for our post F1 stay,   This hotel is on size amazing, for the amount of people coming and going is run fantastic. We checked in with Dianne who was outstanding. She noticed we were celebrating my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary and treated us to a club room with a city view. The view from the 35th floor is amazing.   The infinity pool is a must day and night with jacuzzi's to relax and unwind. If you can get over the selfie plague then you'll be fine. Warm towels and magnificent views. Drinks and food to be expected is expensive but which hotel doesn't increase prices.   MRT close by via shopping precinct. So you can enjoy air con all the way. Plenty of restaurants to enjoy.   Room was great with plenty of amenities as you would…",5,
"MARINA BAY SANDS - THE MOST SPECTACULAR HOTEL IN SINGAPORE, Skypark Pool, Amazing swimming in the world’s highest and longest infinity pool with its unrivalled panoramic views, Privilege First Class Hotel in Singapore",5,
"Last visit 24/3/15 a truly unique experience. Swimming on top of the World is something to experience!! Only in Singapore, only in Marina Bay Sands!! A huge and very impressive hotel Las Vegas style but very unique due to Skypark and infinity pool on 65 floor!!!! Customer Service needs improvement. Check in very impersonal. Highly recommendd. Dont let the plastic service put you off. This was last year perhaps things have improved.",5,
"We stood for one night, booked a normal room but they upgraded us to a suite! The room was clean, big and of course the best thing was the pool on the top with the skyline view! It's a huge hotel, therefore it's a bit crowded.",4,
"This was my second visit to this remarkable landmark. It is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. The rooms, mall access, breakfast, service all 5 out of 5. This will always be my go to hotel whenever I'm in Singapore.  Thank you for a fabulous stay.",5,
"This hotel really deserve a 5 star for its service, location, attraction, and facilities. When you get off from your car/ service/ taxi, an attendant will open the door for you. The rooms are impressive. Family of 4 can fit. You can request for a room facing gardens by the bay or marina bay itself.  Advantage :  Location is very near helix bridge, gardens by the bay, merlion park and esplanade. Nearest MRT is Bayfront (blue line). Shopping : almost all shops are inside MBS shoppes. Food : there's a foodcourt at basement1.  ",5,
"My wife and I stayed here for the last night of our honeymoon.  The staff were great, offering us a free upgrade to a suite on the 6th floor, however we decided to keep our Deluxe Double with City View on the 43rd floor as this offered better views in my opinion.  The room was a very good size and offered everything we needed.  And the view was perfect.  The Pool is incredible offering great views.  All the staff from check in to check out were really polite and helpful.  We'd stay again if visiting that part of the world.",5,
"We stayed at MBS for one night, one our 8th night in Singapore.  I had booked a family suite, for our family of 4 (two teenagers).  We asked about having two rooms instead - but decided that was too pricey and stayed with the family suite on the 2nd floor.  We arrived early from our previous accommodation.  From arriving in the taxi, our experiences with the staff was exceptional.  Exactly what I would hope for.  The concierge was polite and helpful.  We went to the check in counter.  Our room was not ready, but we were given temporary passes to the pool - which we were so happy about.  The kids had a swim whilst we waited.  On check in, I also asked for a late check-out to accommodate our late afternoon flight home, this was no problem thankfully.  We then returned to check in…",5,
"This place is just amazing. You have to place it on your lis of must stay places in Singapore. The quality of the rooms, Sky park experience and views are excellent. Not a cheap experience, but worth it for a special occasion.",5,
"The marina bay sands is simply THE place to be if you are in Singapore (and you have enough ""small money"").  Everything you might see or do is directly at the hotel, around the hotel, easy to reach from the hotel (MRT - subway).  The hotel itself is GORGEOUS, everything is beautifully designed with an incredible care for the  details. The rooms are huge and with a breathtaking bay view through a window-wall.  I have traveled a lot but the breakfast at the marina bay sands was for sure under the best (quality and variety of choice: International, asiaric, Indian... ) I have ever had.  The skypark &  the infinite pool are the cherry on top. You have free access to them as hotel guest anytime (till late at night) and it is REALLY worth it (if you are not guest you have to pay…",5,
"A great example of how we live in the future! Everything mega size , but run in a super efficient way. The biggest hotel atrium I have ever seen. Masses of people . Shops restaurants amenities -all at the press of a button.  If you are looking for an intimate experience -this isn't the place to go to. If you are looking at how we may live in the future-this is it. Convenient location , great views, clean and tidy .",4,
The best thing about marina bay sands is the heated swimming pool that is right at the top of singapore. Good view. Good cocktails. Best ever experience. Would love to come back if the hotel allow slightly more guests than just max of 3 per bedroom.,5,
"Expectation: Paradise!  What actually happened  So we arrive at Changi Airport around 12 noon from Phuket. And arrive at MBS around 1PM. We headed straight towards tower 1 for check in.  Poor service at Tower 1 Reception  We arrive at the hotel around 1PM. The attendant(Sarah) who received us wasn't nice and not helpful. We didn't feel welcome at all. She's not even smiling. We were advised that the standard check-in was 3PM and that they will just email me as soon as our room was ready. The hotel has free wifi for hotel guests but Sarah didn't provide us the password since we don't have a room yet. So how can I check my email if I cannot connect to the internet? So stupid.  She could have done better!  Better Staff at Tower 3  After our plight with Sarah, we decided to visit…",4,
We really enjoyed our time here the staff were wonderful and we even got an upgrade. There is plenty to do around the hotel like visiting the gardens by the bay and a wide range of restaurants to choose from. We only stayed one night due to cost but enjoyed every minute. Would highly recommend😊,5,
"Daytime and night at Singapore so nice! Some body need to helping plan to going to Singapore pls tell me ! I can recommend you for shortly tour in Singapore travel by MRT, find some hotel and some food street, very nice and so cleaner ",5,
"My partner and I was super excited to stay here   She wanted the obligatory selfie from the amazing infinity pool on the top.   This is the problem. So does everyone.  The pool can best be described as ""selfie taker soup"". It's so busy with people taking pictures it's unreal.  The exception area is huge and so busy it's like being in an airport.  It does have everything and the food is amazing from the restaurants and room service but it's just soulless in every way  The rooms are clean and spacious but have no feel of amazement   My advice. Pay the  rate to eat at Wolfgang Pucks and experience he view from the top then stay somewhere else and still be better off ",2,
"We stay here every year after attending the F1 GP before going home, we have never had bad service always welcoming. Club Room for us is the choice it affords you breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés and drinks. The staff at Club 55 always deliver with a welcoming smile and ensure that you are well looked after. The pool is amazing during the day but even more spectacular at night. Love it and we'll be back.",5,
"This hotel is one of the icons of Singapore, with its three towers topped by a curving platform containing the massive infinity pool and assorted bars and restaurants. It is huge, so it takes a bit of time to get around, but I have to say that unlike many places, I did not seem to be waiting forever for elevators. They were mostly there in a few seconds, which is pretty impressive. The restaurants and bars are generally efficient, though a bit pricy, and there are many selections on offer. Breakfast is comprehensive, and available in pretty much all the restaurants, giving you a choice. The pool is busy, being full of people taking selfies rather than swimming, but the centre section is laned off in the early morning, making for what seem to be full sized 50m lengths. The rooms…",4,
"I must say that this hotel is pretty good. It's not amazing, but it's really really good. The rooms are very clean and the service is excellent. Everything is very clear and the staff is always happy to help you out. If you're in Tower 3, it is a bit odd to go down to the lobby, or the top and go to tower 2 for the gym. The restaurants are excellent and everything is pretty much in range. There are a lot of people however... A LOT! It's mostly tourists checking the place out, people shopping and walk through the hotel, or pokemon hunters. I highly recommend this hotel for its extreme cleanliness, great staff and all the shops and MRT within minutes.",5,
"I'll get the niggle out of the way first - on check in we were told that we hadn't paid when we had. It took less than 5 mins to sort out, but as a first impression after a 15 hour journey the last thing you want is somebody telling you that you owe them money.  That aside though it was an epic stay, our room was incredible, we couldn't get over the view of the marina. The pool is as awesome as it looks in the photos and as we were there for F1 weekend we watched one of the support races from the pool - too cool.  We only ate in the restaurants by the pool but both were awesome and sensible money.  It's an epic hotel, treat yourselves and stay here!!!",5,
"Stayed here at the hotel just recently on a stop-over - admittedly only to go to the pool!  The hotel room is pretty standard, nothing flashy - but you need to be a paying guest to gain entry to the pool.  The pool is divided into family friendly and adult only sections which is a bonus.   The pool seemed fairly clean - although there was the odd serviette floating at the bottom!  We arrived pretty early at about 9am and there were still some sun lounges available.  We had to leave at about 11am so I can only imagine how busy it is later in the day - probably not nice!  Worth doing once just for the view x",4,
"We have just spent 3 days at the Marina Bay Sands. It was absolute bliss from the beginning. The experience  of the pool deck , great food and service can truly be recommended. I will definitely be back",5,
"This magnificent hotel with several rooftop bars oh not to mention the worlds highest infinity pool is an absolute must visit. We have been upgraded to a Club Room and we have stayed at 47th floor and also we were given  the room with the view requested - Over the Gardens by the bay, as the other view can be seen from the incredible infinity pool. We would like to thanks to the woman at the reception which give us this opportunity to have the room upgraded. We really enjoyed the stay at Marina Bay Sands. Checking in was done easily even there was a long queue to check in due to the sheer size of the hotel. The process was efficient enough though and we were given a room upgrade as I already mentioned.   The rooms are huge, bathrooms very well equipped with a separate shower and…",4,
"My wife and I stayed 2 nights with our children, thought the WOW factor might not be there on our second stay. 47th  floor Suite with views of City one end  and gardens at other was beautiful. Thumbs up for pool from kids. Bubble bath while watching gardens light show will not be forgotten 😎",5,
"We stayed At the Marine Bay Sands for two days at the end of our family trip in Bali and Singapore. The hotel is huge. That means a lot of people, but you have to take this as part of the experience in which you decided to immerse yourself and your family.  When you enter the Marina Bay Sands hotel is like entering the airport hall or one big shopping mall. …After check in (it took 20minutes) our butler took as to our room. We stayed in the Suite at the 44 floor in tower 2. The Suite is very big ….we are a family of five (three small kids). And as there was no Family room available we took the Suite. The room was nice, clean, with a very nice view to the gardens by the bay and the sea…but I think it’s overpriced… We were a little bit disappointed that they forgot to prepare the…",4,
"We wanted to experience a little luxury as a treat & we weren't disappointed. It started from check-in with the wonderful Antonio and continued with every staff member we met.  Honestly I'd stay here just for the spectacular rooftop pool, but proximity to transport, Gardens by the Bay and the shopping mall meant that everything you need for your stay is on your doorstep.  We had a great time and look forward to the day we can return to sample a little luxury.",5,
"High Floor, City View, Non Smoking.  You can see the race during F1 Season. Was invited to the F1 Race Party too. Free Flow of food..many many good food..really enjoyed..and also live streaming of the race while enjoying myself with the free flow of food and drinks(beer & wine).  Very impressive race party...with live band and lucky draw...  CITY View suites are nothing to complain about...they are the best that MBS can offer...everything is good...  love soaking in the hot tub in my room...staffs are very friendly at tower 1..  10/10 treatment...nothing to complain...good services...  Dont really like to go to the skypool anymore...too many people..and when too many people there, it's very dirty...hence i rather soak in my own bath tub...haha..",4,
"This spectacular hotel is almost like a small city, underground shopping malls with luxury stores and fine dining restaurants. The most amazing pool in the world but it does get a tad busy. Worth buying a club room for the spectacular breakfast and gourmet  tasting dishes with wine, champagne, cocktails and spirits 5pm-7pm both served on the 55th floor with views to die for. Within the hotel are several amazing restaurants, night club on the roof. Simply amazing",5,
"I stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for one night of my 5 night stay in Singapore in September 2016.  Checking in There was a long queue to check in due to the sheer size of the hotel. The process was efficient enough though and we were given a room upgrade as a member of our party's birthday was approaching.   Rooms The rooms are huge,  bathrooms very well equipped with a separate shower and toilet, and two sinks. With the city view rooms, the view was stunning, especially at night.  Facilities The hotel is renowned for its infinity pool and I spent hours in and by the pool. The view at night is something to behold and overall, the pool experience was unforgettable.   Food/Drink I had breakfast at Rise - the buffet choice was great and the service excellent. The hotel is huge and…",5,
"Stayed for two nights at Marina Bay Sands. Check-in was fine and we have a room with the city view. Room was very spacious. Bed was very comfy and bathrooms were huge, (I really wish they had water spray at the WC though)  The view from our room was beautiful. They provide TWG teas but the mini fridge were filled with drinks and due to the auto-sensor of each slots, we wont abled to take out the drinks for our personal items. But they do provide service with a charge if guests requires personal fridge.  The infinity pool view is to die for. We enjoyed swimming and photo-taking during our morning and night swim. The only downfall was that they were very strict with the entry to the pool. Every guest needs to have your own keycard. Totally understand the restrictions and security…",4,
"We seem to always stay at MBS when we come to Singapore for the F1 weekend.  The F1 experience is outstanding, and so is our sojourn at MBS.   Despite its size, everything works seamlessly.  It’s a slick operation.    We had a wonderful suite on the 41st floor of Tower 3, with a spectacular 180 view of the CBD (downtown) skyline.  The room is very comfortable and was perfect for our stay.  Perhaps the only complaint would be that given the large size of the bathroom, there was only one sink.  For a couple, I always prefer double sinks.    The pool on the sky deck is of course one of the main feature of MBS.  Every time we come here it’s impressive.  And every time we come here there are a ton of people up there taking selfies and photos.  It is super photogenic.    Somehow you…",5,
"Stayed only one night but had to share the feedback. Great location, great views and the amazing pool is worth it despite the weather making it sometimes less fun!   Bad points:   Very very noisy rooms! I could hear full conversations and even when we came back at 3am we couldn't sleep due to the noise from other rooms.   As per other reviews, staff are not particularly friendly or helpful, though there were some that were (check out staff and pool service)   ",4,
"There are so many nice Hotels in Singapore but the Marina Bay Sands is the only one with an amazing pool so high up on its roof. The down side to this is you have to be a guest to have access to swim in the pool. The pool area does get very busy so I would suggest getting up early to get a sun lounger and an excellent view. And if you are planning a visit here a waterproof camera is a must, as iPads and smartphones can get slippery. As for the rest of the hotel it is very nice but a little expensive so if your not interested in swimming you may want to shop around.",4,
"This is a busy hotel! I knew the hotel was an attraction but the foyer can be crazy busy in the daytime so this doesn't feel like a relaxing hotel.  Check in experience wasn't great and i needed to complain to the manager, but after that the staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was an enjoyable one. The room was comfortable and big.  We paid for a city view and it was fabulous, although I can't imagine looking out onto the gardens is a bad view either. The sky pool was the best feature, and one of the reasons we stayed here.  Again it was very busy but there were beds free to leave your things and we were able to get a space on the edge to get photos without anyone else in them!  We went up at dusk so got to see the daytime view and the night.  The lights are a…",4,
We stayed at marina Bay Sands for 3 nights The hotel is very good but it's not that luxury as advertised (not one of the amazing buildings that have been ever made world wide)  The rooms and house keeping are excellent  The location is great as its on the top of the subway station (but so is all Singapore 😉)  Of course its a five star hotel but very expensive and is not worth it   The infinite pool is the only thing that worth a visit for this hotel but its always crowded and usually raining  So I recommend just spending one night there to have access to the pool,4,
"Amazing service, great breakfast. Recommended staying in the Club rooms or suits. Breakfast included in the club55 lounge access to rooftop infinity pool, with amazing views. Stayed for a week for our anniversary, one of the porters brought a cake to our room without any prompting from us. Recommend a room facing the marina/city. The hotel staff made our stay very special, highly recommended.",5,
"I stayed there since it was next to the Ultra Music Festival and for the infinity pool. The pool was amazing and the view of the city is not one to be missed. The room size was normal, but it was very clean. After each time the maid cleaned our room there was a cute towel folded animal! The location was great - right next to Gardens By the Bay, Sands Mall, and MRT station. They also have the one and only casino in Singapore. Highly recommended!",5,
The Marina bay sands pool is superb. It certainly is one of the best infinity pools in the world. But the hotel is only worth for the pool. All the other services are around average (for a 5* hotel)...,3,
"This magnificent hotel with several rooftop bars oh not to mention the worlds highest infinity pool is an absolute must visit. We did not stay at the hotel as I have family that we stayed with, but I have to say that the views and stunning architectural wonder that is the 600ft+ Marina Bay Sands will take your breath away. Even consider having the $25 Singapore Sling mixed drink while atop over looking the pool and city is a perfect mid-afternoon relaxation point. On the other side up top you can see Indonesia and the unreal amount container and bulk cargo ships, by the hundreds, waiting to be unloaded and loaded. This is an absolute must see if your travels take you to this wonderful tropical English speaking country 1 degree north of the equator....be prepared to sweat!",5,
"We stayed here for 3 nights on our way back from Sydney. OK, I have to admit the pool is fantastic and the views amazing. If you took the pool away the hotel is nothing that special as somewhere to stay. It is ridiculously busy with people visiting the hotel to see the pool and the attached shopping mall and casino. the foyer and reception area is like Grand Central Station in rush hour - all the time! There are literally thousands of people milling around, mostly on their phones! The hotel staff are good and very well trained, but the whole experience is very impersonal and cold. The pool is a must see, once seen however, there is no need to stay here again!",3,
Excellent hotel with outstanding features and details. You must swim in this pool at least once - amazing views - next to the Gardens by the Bay and easily walked to and within  - some excellent restaurants and breakfast bars within the hotel - worth every cent of what we paid and I will return,5,
"The room is NORMAL but nice,clean, the bed was comfortable. The room size is normal not so big. You alrd your knw that your only paying for the Amazing view of singapore and the worlds best infinity pool for me...I really love the pool. We really enjoyed the pool. We had our dinner at the hotel lobby ""RISE"" buffet was superb👍🏻👍🏻 two thumbs up..The hotel staff were friendly.. definitly will come back to marina bay sands hotel..",4,
"Awful hotel with ineffective management who wish to extract as much money as possible from their 'customers'.  Customer care, service and public safety all compromised by hotels desire for a quick buck.  We stayed there over the 2016 F1 weekend and had to move out of our first room after one night because of the noise from the A/C.  It rattled constantly.  Second room had no coffee/tea facilities and when this was referred to the duty manager he said that perhaps the room had them but I had been unable to find them.  (We had located them in the first room so knew where they should have been in the second room!).  The room key card failed three times on one day and since every hotel guest has to have an active card to access the top floor (viewing platform and the swimming pool)…",1,
"Great views of the city skyline. Experience at the infinity pool was pretty good. However, it was very crowded almost EVERYWHERE within the hotel/resort.   We had a bad experience at with the valet where communication was very poor on more than 1 occasion, and our car couldn't be located due to them writing down our carplate number wrongly.  Good as a once off experience, but will not be returning....",3,
"As you can see, I am very impressed by the whole location at Marina Bay including the hotel itself.   I've been already for countless of times to S'pore and stayed in hotels. But this hotel is just awesome. Ok, its always crowded but the staffs manage to give us the feeling of comfortable and taken care of.  Everything is there. Everything is nice. We stayed for a week at the suite with the view to the city.  The Infinity Pool is worth the travel too.  One little minus point is the changing room after checking out and the fridge. You cant put hardly anything - once you move the things inside you are already being charged.",5,
"An pricey stay, but must do! Very lucky to be upgraded to the Strait Suite as we had booked 2 rooms. I would have never thought I needed a karaoke room in my hotel before this! Adrien (very tall man!) ushered us in and showed us around.  The main reason for staying was to be able to use the pool. Looked a little worn (I saw bandaids in the overflow trough of the infinity pool edge?) but the water was cool and the food and drink service was fast! Also great to find the hot spa tubs facing the Gardens by the Bay.",4,
We stayed at MBS on Monday night just after the F1 so it wasn't too crazy busy which was good.  We had booked 2 club rooms as we have stayed before but got an upgrade to a suite this visit. I was a bit worried we were not all going to fit but I was very very wrong the suite was huge and was really beautiful we were extremely impressed.  It had two bedrooms and two bathrooms and a lounge area which was perfect for 3 adults and 2 kids.  The club lounge is great and the pool was as perfect as before.  All the staff are very helpful.  The only annoying thing is the people who take up all the chairs in the lobby playing Pokemon.   We couldn't even get a seat after we checked out when we were waiting for dinner.  I don't even think these people are even staying in the hotel.,5,
"I have been to Singapore 3 times and have always wanted to stay at MBS. It was everything I had hoped for in a hotel.   We got a room w a garden view rather than city which was perfect. Got to see the light show over the gardens without having to leave the balcony. As soon as you put ur room key into the room the curtains open up automatically. Nice touch have not seen that done in any hotel.  The infinity pool was amazing, yes its overcrowded and yes people leave towels and its hard to get a seat by the pool but for how many rooms this hotel has, I would have expected the pool to be crowded, its the highlight of the hotel and everyone wants photos resting on the edge.. My only grip is ban selfie sticks in the pool.. Its annoying!  No issue w staff found them all to be helpful…",4,
"Very Good View. We enjoyed the panoramic view of the city’s skyline. We can relax in the  swimming pool is on rooftop. We loved the pool.  Everything is good. We have a nice experience..  I often visit Singapore but this is the first time for stay at this hotel. The latest time I visit Singapore and took a photo with Merlion where opposite this hotel. My husband told me that the Marina Bay Sand Hotel is very good, he would like to stay at this hotel at least one time in his life. So next year I booked this hotel for birthday surprise to him, He said very good hotel, very good experience, everything is perfect. We were very happy.",5,
"This property has three towers for guest accommodation, they have a swimming pool on top of these towers, Rooms are spacious and staff is very cooperative, you can see entire Singapore from top floor of this property, Definitely recommendable property to friends and family.",5,
"The marina bay sands is a beautiful place.  You walk into an impressive atrium which connects the various hotel towers.  You also immediately sense how big and busy this place is.   Our room was modern, sufficiently large and had everything one needs.  The rooms were also very quiet, with little to no outside noise.  Beds were comfortable.  The free wifi was good.  The hotel facilities are great...the gym is large and well equipped.  The swimming pool of course is beautiful, located on the top floor with gorgeous views of the city.  Just be careful not to bump into the hundreds of selfie stick carrying enthousiasts.  (it was busy even at 7am and 11pm).  The buffet breakfast was too expensive but did have a very good selection.  The hotel staff was professional, but with so many…",4,
"It was One of the bestest experience of Life. Staying at Marina Bay Sands was Too Good, The Breathtaking view of Infinity Pool, The View From the Rooms was Ultimate and food was Amazing. Specially The Morning Breakfast. too good, highly recommended if you visit singapore.",5,
The pool is out of this world with the views!! The staff super friendly!! The malls amazing! The rooms very clean and big! This hotel is a must even for one night! I would stay here all the if I ever come back!! ,5,
"When you get into an elevator at Marina Bay Sands there is a video with a Dvid Beckham type ( or was it him- I don't care enough to know) with the catch phrase ""never settle"". However we had to settle for room on the second floor- any possible view was obstructed by foliage - so the whole experience was wasted. Two lessons- take both key cards up to infinity pool - one each for couple (Singaporeans are sticklers for rules) and be careful about cheap online rules- you get what you pay for.  Best food at cheap food court at shopping mall - forget overpriced eateries .",2,
"We had an amazing experience albeit just the one night but it was a treat and had always been something I wanted to do.   Amazing hotel, the service was exceptional, we spent (as did everyone else) most of our time poolside, Brennan who was one of the hotels pool side service staff was particularly excellent. Nothing was too much trouble which should felt like a mantra for MBS adopted in all areas of the hotel.   The rooms were great and they needed to be for the price paid. They did not fail to impress.  All round a fantastic experience which is a must for all. If I win the lotto I will return. Why not stick it on your bucket list.",5,
"We booked 2 nights here while passing through Singapore. Clearly the main reason people come to this resort is the pool. Well I tell you if you want to be packed in to a pool like sardines then you will love it. This is no fault of MBS, the place has over 2000 rooms and if only 10% of the rooms are interested in the pool you probably have 400 people up there... So I  say book 1 night. Have your swim in the pool sit on a lounge then go to a better located hotel with just as good facilities that are not been over used.  Also everything is very expensive at this hotel. I hate the symbol ++ Why not include the gst and extras in the price. I just want to know the end price. It's not like we have a choice in the ++. Massive amount of shopping options if you have an unlimited crddit…",4,
"My boyfriend and I had a one night stay at MBS from 20-21 Sept. Initially I was very excited, but after the stay, I was much disappointed.  Firstly, upon check in, the front desk staff was new and inexperienced. She had problems trying to charge my debit card and had to get another staff to help which was fine. What aggravated me was when we asked for a later check out because the check out time at 11am was way too early. Usually, at other 5 star hotels that we had stayed in, such as Mandarin Oriental, we always get a later check out. However, at MBS, the staff didn't even bother checking with anyone or the system, and immediately said that she cannot give us a later checkout without any reason whatsoever. This, I feel, was rather unprofessional.    The room was normal, pretty…",1,
"This is the third time we have stayed in this hotel in the last four years and I cannot rate it highly enough. The rooms are excellent, well designed, tastefully decorated, with everything you could possibly need within. Perfectly maintained and cleaned. The staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming. The rooftop infinity pool is stunning and nothing I can say here would do it justice. There is a ""no kids"" area in the pool which is a real bonus. There is now a Spargo on the roof level, which provides the best buffet breakfast I've had anywhere (something that was lacking on previous visits). Non-residence are not allowed on the roof. There are a number of great bars in the hotel (Spargo being one of them), as well as some fabulous restaurants; Sky 57 on the roof, Cut and db in…",5,
"The pool size is good and surrounded by mini park with spa pools. The atmosphere is great with happy travellers.  Although a bit crowded, you can still enjoy some privacy in the smaller spa pools around or walk to the lookout area to take some awesome pictures of the city.",4,
"Great overall view over Marina Bay and city skyline. Not really check to access observation deck, but worse the money.",4,
Super sweet views from our upgraded room and we could not get enough of the infinity pool. Rooms were nothing short of expectations - just the luxurious escape we were looking for. Loved every part of our stay and look forward to our next visit.,5,
"We stayed in a suite and it was breathtaking. The hotel, staff and location were perfect. We have been every year for 5 years. Once you stay at MBS you won't want to stay anywhere else. A must for anyone wanting a little luxury.",5,
"I decided to stay at the Marina bay Sands hotel with my family for the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix weekend after a thoroughly enjoyable experience at the same hotel for the 2014 Singapore Grand Prix. Unfortunately the customer service has declined to such a state that I will not be returning. We were greeted at check-in by a trainee, which is fine everybody has to learn, but her Supervisor was terrible. Blunt and rude.  We were informed that our original booking, which was booked and paid for some 9 months ago was not available and we had to accept a lower standard room with no view on the lower floors. We were also told the hotel was busy so we would have to accept the room. I said that I was not happy to the Supervisor and that I would make a complaint, she was not bothered in…",2,
"Me and my girlfriend booked for a Premier city view room, for 2 nights. Once we arrived at the hotel, we were happy that your room was available already, even though it was 12pm, and the check-in time is 3pm. The room was really nice, with the bed facing the window, and the view was amazing. Unfortunately, we left the room, and when we came back, around 1/2pm, some water was leaking from the ceiling... I went to the reception to change our room. The person who took care of us was very nice, and after checking with her manager, offered us a late check-out until 2pm. The real problem started the next morning, when we both woke up at 7 am because we had a connecting door in our room, and it was trembling, so making quite a lot of noise... I went to the reception, to ask them to…",1,
Pool and the view from the top is fantastic. Staff are helpful and also to our surprise they upgraded us :) . One night stay is more than enough to enjoy the hotel and its views. Restaurants of the hotel were kind of crowded and sitting outside at Celavi requires reservations. Mall adjoined is nice and  good for luxury brands . Anyway hotel location is close to gardens by the bay. Again the view from the room and top of the hotel is superb ! definitely worth the stay!,5,
"The gf booked this room for my birthday, thanks dear ! We stay on the 46th floor facing Indonesia side, yes, on a clear day, Indonesia is just practically outside the balcony.  The room is nice with a very big king size bed, and the bathroom is HUGE, the shower stall itself its almost half a room !   The roof top infinity pool is fantastic but just way too crowded for my liking.  I hardly have any contact with the staff except during check in and check out, so i really dont know, somehow this hotel lack ""soul"" .  Food wise, we ate at Celebrity restaurants over at the Casino side, but that's for another review.",5,
Definitely worth a visit. Absolutely amazing views of Singapore. Souvenirs pretty pricy...but as expected.  Not too busy when i visited over the Grand Prix weekend. Dont get sucked in to the photo which is printed out when you reach the top.... $180 for a group photo!!!!,5,
"First of all the hotel is very huge, there was a long queue for check in, I felt I was in an airport :) The room was very spacious (comparing with other hotels in Singapore) with balcony and very nice view. The most important and famous part is the swimming pool which was very nice experience. I expected the hotel to be more luxurious comparing the price",4,
"Could not give this 5 stars simply because you simply don't get the personal attention you would get from a smaller hotel Our first choice for our weekend in Singapore, The Fullerton was fully booked 13 months in advanced so decided to book MBS Arriving on the overnight plane from London hotel policy is check in at 3pm we were at the hotel for 8am I had emailed ahead and asked for a room to be made available and was told they would see what the could do  Fearing the worst given the busy weekend it was a great relief and surprise to find our room was ready Check in was speedy and efficient albeit a little impersonal felt like you were in a huge shopping mall Our room n tower 3 was excellent with great views over the Gardens in the Bay and the last corner of the F1 course Free…",4,
"The highlight of this hotel is the Pool. I stayed in a Club Room overlooking the city and it was an amazing experience.   The check in however, took like an hour almost. Also, the queue for breakfast the next morning also took about an hour. So you check in at 2-3pm and you have to leave by midday.   I only stayed the one night to use the pool, and I also had dinner at Ce La Vie, the restaurant on the sky deck. The restaurant has excellent food, befitting for the MBS. However, drinks are $25 each which I thought was a bit much. Two whisky mixes and it was $50.  I guess it really is for high rollers.  Nevertheless, it is an experience that you should go on if you have the dollars. If not, an infinity pool in Bali is also a good bet, and for $600, you could probably stay a week. …",4,
"We stayed there for only 1 night. We really regret that we didn't stay one day more... The hotel is excellet! Our room was big and so comfortable. The bathroom was huge! We love it! It is expensive, but you pay for luxury and incredible pool at the 57th floor. Swimming there was wonderful experience and I totally recommed it for everyone! Hotel is clean and new. Really nice waiters at the pool. So good and quick check in and we got our room 3 hours before. The casino is nice and we won some money there! I really want to come back there!!! :))) ",5,
It was a pretty huge and amazing room. Informed the staff that it's my friend's birthday and we will be celebrating inside the room and requested for early check in. Informed staff at check in that we would like the birthday cake and have it delivered when my friend was there. ,4,
"Needless to say, the highlight of this staycation is to be able to swim in the highest swimming pool in the world. Hence, am not going to post or say much about the swimming pool.  Instead, I would like to focus on the service that despite this massive hotel, still managed to score well in many areas as compared to even other smaller, luxurious hotels.   Booking the club room is definitely worth it as if you look at the published rates, the club room is around S$150 to S$200 more. My point here is the Marina Bay Sands is already priced high, and especially on weekend, the Deluxe Room is probably like S$370 to S$400 onwards and since by staying here and meaning you are going to splurge, why not more in pampering yourself.   For the Grand Club Room booked, it is really spacious at…",5,
"I am sure many people around the world  knows of this popular and luxurious hotel. It is Singapore's pride and one of Southeast Asia's tallest landmark. It does not failed to keep its status.  I had a conference last week and was excited to stay at this hotel. I was lucky to get special price by group reservation. I must say, the hotel really meet my expectation of luxurious.  Check in was long and busy but the receptionist managed to keep everything smooth. All the staff including the concierge and housekeeping were attentive and generally friendly. The service is great.  The hotel is clean, well maintained and interesting. I like the structure and design. The room is very spacious, comfortable, clean and nicely furnished. I got a room at level 50 facing the garden and the sea…",5,
"Arrived at hotel, the guys at front of tower 1 were good, took our luggage and arranged for it to be sent to our room, there was no queue for check in, it was not busy however there was atleast 10 staff behind the check in area running around like headless chicken it looked like absolute clutter. We were greeted by a oriental guy who was wearing glasses, he checked us in, this took approximately 10 minutes. In those 10 minutes he didn't congratulate us ummm it does state on our documents we are here for honeymoon but okay not to worry, didn't tell us were breakfast would be, didn't tell us anything about the hotel, didn't tell us anything useful apart from our room number... Great start. We then walked away only to be called back as he forgot to take our luggage tag!!! …",4,
We spent five nights at the Marina Bay Sands and had a great time!  It is in a fabulous location and great to have an MRT station below the hotel making it very easy to get around.  Check in was very smooth and we were very soon heading to our room.  We were a little disappointed to only be on the 7th floor but we still had a great view of the Gardens by the Bay (well worth a visit). We were advised that the third bed had not yet been placed in our room but it arrived within minutes.  The room was a generous size so it didn't feel too cramped with 3 adults. The bathroom was very spacious with a lovely pedestal bath.  We really used the hotel as a base but also made use of the fabulous rooftop infinity pool - a surreal experience!  We also enjoyed cocktails in the rooftop Flight…,5,
External Hotel Structure- 5 star Infinity pool - 5 star Room - 2 star  Hospitality - 1 star  Overall experience - the real attraction of this hotel is the infinity pool on the 56 floor along with other pubs n restaurants. Both the gardens n city view is absolute delight. Nothing special to mention other then the above.,3,
"I stayed here for a couple of nights while attending a conference in July.   Pro's: - We had a separate area for checkin across the road which was very prompt and easy - Rooms are a great size and lovely bathroom - Room service was great and not over the top expensive  Cons: - The hotel is massive an extremely busy - Very strict with giving out keys  - The pool area is so crowded I felt like I couldn't enjoy it - the day we arrived, tried to go into the restaurant/ bar area to get something to eat but were told they were at capacity  Personally I don't really think that it is worth the money to say here",3,
"Checkin was great first of a kind.... the greater me as My car pulled in, took me to the room to fill out the check in forms.... wow  Room slightly outdated with best view of sea. Bathroom were great. Roof top bar was good.  Infinity pool was good but crowded.  Excellent views. Lobby is always crowded. Close to mall Anand MRT.  Excellent location lots to do. Definitely will visit again.  Should have had 3 layer of pool but, can't imagine such a big pool with water at that level... truly amazing ",4,
"Okay this is really a large busy hotel - so suits business and couples, I would not say this is a family friendly place.  And not romantic because there is no space or quietness that you could get with boutique hotels.  The hotel is such an experience in itself it brings in the general public by the truck load - imagine a shopping centre.  Then across the way is the gardens by the bay - visit at night.  Daytime you will miss all the detail and lighting etc so make this a night trip.  To get there you need to go out of the hotel and access the overhead walkway on level 6.  Breakfast was very good but the coffee will really disappoint - if you are Australian or Italian then this will be a real jolt to the system - Americano coffee in a pot, 1980s style.  The 'swimming' pool is a…",4,
"Although a very large hotel, you are treated like an individual the staff are very friendly and helpful.The rooms are large clean and have all the amenities you require.I will definitely come back. The restaurants are good and the roof top pool deck shouldn't be missed.",5,
The hotel was as good as it looks and the restaurants were pretty good too.  However the customer survive were not worth the price.  I would stay at different hotels and visit marina bay sands for the restaurants on top of the building. ,3,
"We booked this place as it was recommended by a friend and their was a lot of hype about it. It did not dissapoint! The food was great at the pool on the top of the hotel. The coffees and cakes were well priced at the shop in Tower 3 (Sweetspot) and the service was excellent. The room was a really good size with an amazing view (we booked a city view). We had dinner at Cut by Wolfgang Puck which was one of the best meals I have had. A great wine list along with some amazing steaks and the service was spot on. Relaxed, fun but professional. Overall a great hotel with great service. A special mention to Jeb at check in, despite being 3 hours early he got us a room straight away and was genuine and helpful beyond expectation. Also sign up for the MBS card that gets you discount in…",5,
"The most amazing infinity pool! Definitely worth experiencing! Lovely hotel staff, who organised for me a birthday surprise!  Only down sides was Ultra Singapore Festival was on next door so the room was literally vibrating. Also the hotel has an impersonal airport feel to it. Overall highly recommended! ",5,
"A fabulous piece of design engineering, however that is where the appeal ends. Stepping foot inside this building is manic, there are people everywhere! Signs and entry are minimal, costs are massive. Entry is only at either end of the building and try and enter from river end as its closer to the lift that takes you up to the top floor. A charge for the deck was not realised but the staff (used to many questions I'm sure) kindly let us know that we can go up for a drink. The Ce La Vi Skybar has a happy hour from 5-630pm that is pretty good value, however additional drinks will be quite costly and you end up waiting forever for the bartenders to make that ever so special drink! They even take ages to complete the payment transaction. Initially if you are not choosing the ""happy…",3,
"To be honest I only booked a room to get access to the Infinity Pool and believe me, I didn't regret it. My stay at this hotel was just unforgettable. I had a really nice room at the 47th floor (don't think it was a basic room, because it was really big for 2 person). The infinity pool on the 57th floor is just great and i loved it to relax in the pool drinking an expensive beer. For dinner I went to the restaurant Cé La Vie, also on the 57th floor in Tower 3. The food was great, the wine was good and the view was amazing. After dinner I spent some time at the bar drinking cocktails and enjoying the view.  Later at night I went to the Casino which I really enjoyed (maybe because I won enough money to pay my accommodation....)  The only problem I had during the stay, was that I…",5,
"We had a city view room and loved the view, absolutely awesome and breathtaking. Breakfast was amazing, catering to a very wide clientele, a lot of choices. Marina Bay Sands is the ""must to stay"" place at least one or two nights when you visit Singapore for the experience.",5,
"Stayed here for our last few days in Singapore. Fast check in and our room (which was massive) was ready early. Delicious breakfast buffet at Club 55. Friendly, helpful staff. View from Club 55, our room and Skydeck, breath taking. Infinity pool was fun but can get crowded. Gardens by the Bay next door. Would love to come back.",5,
"The hotel is really worth a visit The swimming pool is just breathtaking. Rooms are nice (ask for one with a view to the marina bay gardens- at night it has an outstanding view) You must book a night at Marina Bay at least, when staying in Singapore",5,
"I really love going back to Singapore since for my opinion they had clean and organize country and it always feels good to be there. It's my first time to experience the Marina Bay Sands and all I can say is that we had amazing and great experience. I just love our stay since I tried thier famous and beautiful infinity pool which is located at 57th floor which give you an access to see the singapore skyscrapers and of course the the skypark. I just love being there on top of marina bay sands. Also love thier room and of course the room view. I like the fact that they had mall so there a lot to choice where to eat and shop. They also had amazing staff. Overall, great service and amazing experience.",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands, or the MBS as it is rather disrespectfully abbreviated to, dominates the Singapore skyline.  It looms over the bay like some giant's toy cricket stumps, with the Art and Science museum like an abandoned broken ball by its side. Just hope the giant doesn't come back anytime soon to restart the game!! You quickly run out of superlatives as you move around the hotel - biggest, best, highest, longest etc. Even the flower pots in the lobby atrium are taller than a man and house trees rather than flowers.  To carry on with the cricket analogy I stayed high up in the off stump (Tower 3) just beneath the bails. The tower curved away from me below so my window looked straight to the ground below and out over the spectacular bay and skyline beyond.  The rooms are big…",5,
"I thought this hotel was extraordinary. My room on the 40th floor had views of the botanical gardens and marina which are both spectacular. The rooms were comfortable with nice little balconies outside. Room service was excellent, as were the housekeeping staff. The infonoty pool on the roof is really a marvel at night. The checkout queue was a little long but that is the only thing I could find even a grain of fault in. Excellent and highly recommended.",5,
"I believe Marina Bay Sands is a highly over rated property and there are better options in Singapore. That said, the swimming pool of this hotel is a must experienced and it seems the hotel is capitalising only on it. Considering the steep price, there is no personalised service of any sort. The rooms are of good size but otherwise as normal as any four star hotel. The buffet breakfast is very good and view of Garden by the Bay from the pool/restaurant areas is amazing.",3,
"Went there in July.. I believe it is only the view from the pool that makes this hotel stand out..the service and everything is okay..the night view from my room were just ""breathtaking""..One should visit this hotel on their visit to the electric city~SINGAPORE.",4,
Amazing hotel with Nice staff ! Infinity pool is amazing with great service and great staff ! The menu There is great but pricy ! The bad part is that as a hotel guest you cannot enter all the clubs that the hotel offer only the rooftop bar which is packed and have limited seating! For the price paid for the rooms the hotel guests should have free entry to all parts of the hotell !  Also the amount the block as a deposit ( cash or credit card ) is a larger sum which people should be aware of  ,5,
"We celebrated our friend's 40th birthday at hotel-stayed in family room. 2 out of the 4 days there was a music festival on and the location was across the road from the hotel. Our room was facing this location and the heavy music started pumping from 9 am. Our room literally shook and the thumbing was so loud that gave us all headaches and migraines. It was quite disappointing as the hotel did not inform us of this prior to our arrival. As it is a family suite - there would be families there staying in these room types and I would hate to see how the young children cope during nap time. As adults we all experienced discomfort with the noise and we could not get out of the room early enough to avoid the music, let alone young children with their sleeps. I addition, house keeping…",3,
"This hotel is (obviously) on the high price point in Singapore. Due to the unique views and infinity pool alone however, it is definitely paying the price for at least one night's stay. The beds are super comfortable, which is another bonus.   Tips would be to make reservations at not only the restaurants in the hotel, but in the mall as well. Get to the pool early or during off-hours to receive a seat. The pool-side food and drink menu is pretty decent and reasonably priced. ",5,
"What else can it ve said about one of the most famous hotels in the world?  I booked a double room with a view over Marina Bay in advance, as they sell out rather fast. The check-in requested a bit of wait because the number of people staying here is huge, but nothing terrible, about ten minutes or so. The receptionist was very nice and always kept a big smile: it was cool to feel somewhat special, even if they have literally thousands of visitors every day. As per my request I was given a room in a higher floor and with a good view of the marina.  The room (very spacious) had all the amenities I could ask for: TV with a lot of channels, lots of plugs, a big bathroom with both a buthtub and a shower, armchairs and a small table in front of the large window. The view, as…",5,
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands, Wow.  ""This one has it all "" Large Premier room on the 48th floor Tower block 1, fantastic views of the city and the feature of this great hotel is the rooftop infinity pool which didn't disappoint . The best time to visit the infinity pool is at night when this hotel comes alive, the rooftop is buzzing, from the ground floor 24 hour casino with friendly staff, to the 57 floor with the club 55  and never forgetting the pool. Shopping they have all the top brands here, plenty to eat in some amazing restaurants, Look no further if you want a great hotel this is the one . You Will not be disappointed .",5,

We stayed for 3 nights. Singapore is overall a nice and clean country!   We live in the states and we often go to Las Vegas and the Marina Bay Sand really reminded me of the Aria in Vegas. So i wasn't in awww...  BUT the POOL was out of this world... The view you get from the pool is amazing... it's WORTH your money and time to stay at this hotel for the pool and the view. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Location of the hotel was very convenient.. you can access the subway (which was SUPER clean) and the huge MALL.   Pool was NOT crowded...,5,
"We booked a premier room on floor 43 overlooking the gardens and sea . Bed very comfortable with a great bathroom with shower and tub bath. The balcony is small but fine with a good view of the gardens. Coffee tea mini bar, hair dryer etc. Go up to the 57th floor to the infinity pool that is open to 11pm. You can take in amazing views of the city that are quite breath taking. As you walk past the pools there are restaurants then a club for guests sometimes, then a sky view area open till 10pm or a bar open until 2pm. You must carry your room card every where as you have to go through pass gates everywhere including going to the toilet.  We saw a women and young child refused entry to the toilet due to having left the card behind. I tried to go into the club bar which was…",3,
Every hotel has it's charm.  This one is incredible. You can enjoy it from afar.  Enjoy  it from within.  Enjoy the best pool on earth.   The coolest discotheque on earth with the best view of Singapore with it.  You can dine with the best.  The rainforest on the back is simply overwhelming.   Without a doubt it's worth totally the stay.  Minimum of three days in Singapore to enjoy all it has to offer.    The most amazing commercial center below.    The best casino in town.   Plays and theater also.    This is the most incredible hotel of all.  ,5,
"A truly excellent hotel- the only downside is that Singapore has so much to explore and you won't want to leave the hotel! Infinity pool 57 stories up, world class dining and drinks with a view, a 24hr Casino, Viewing Platforms that take in city views, ocean views & an F1 street circuit... Add a bit of indulgence in club 55 with an overindulgent afternoon tea session, follow that up with a massively diverse drinks & inventive canapé early supper between 1700 & 1930 and you'll feel stretched for time to shop, explore china town, visit little India & have an obligatory Sling across town in the Long Bar.. The suites are lavishly large too! (Especially when your used to down town London dimensions)... Pricey, maybe. Value for money, definitely!",5,
"this is a large hotel, but the towerblocks with 60+ floors each, splits the hotel in three and mitigates the feeling of too many people.  very cleverly designed and great rooms with a fantastic view of singapore city or singapore roads (waiting ships).  the bar and pool facilities are second to none and the infinity pool(s) fantistic and bizzare at the same time.  the hotel is a resort in itself and the shopping centre attached is superhuge and covers all types of retail therapy.",4,
"First time in Singapore so had to stay at this iconic hotel and wow it did not disappoint. Easy to check in, although I can imagine it could get very busy.  We booked a premier, with city view, and we were on 48th floor with amazing view. Room was lovely.  Breakfast was fantastic with lots of choice.  Swimming pool was utterly amazing - tip - go between 11 and 3 and you will get sunbed by pool.",5,
We had to wait for half an hour for check in because there was a long line. The hotel is nice but over crowded because it has 2500 rooms. I think MBS offers the best view of Singapore. The pool is breathtaking especially from dawn onwards. But again it is very crowded. Apparently the best time to take photos is during lunch time when people go for lunch. We had an amazing room with an amazing view looking at the city. I suggest you to take a city-view room  where you can see the skyline of singapore.,5,
"Worth visiting during your first time visit to Singapore. More for capturing imagery., you can reach my SMT (metro) or taxi even by bus..since its small city you may spent at max 18 SGD to reach or about 1SGD by metro. ",4,
"The Marina Bay Sands is a must do experience if you go to Singapore. The rooms are first class. The service is excellent and the views are amazing. I was lucky enough to have a room at level 46.   This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in and if you go to Singapore you have to experience it, if only for the views and the pool. ",5,
"This is a late review as we just got back from our trip. My partner and I stayed here in January at the beginning of our lengthy South East Asia trip. Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was meant to be one of the luxury highlights of our trip and it was until the morning we were checking out. The house keeping staff had started cleaning our room on the day of departure while we were eating breakfast. We had left our new go pro camera on the bed and when we returned it was stolen. We confronted the staff and sought out management and nothing was achieved from this. The housekeeping were unpleasantly rude, yelling at us in a different language and laughing at me when I was crying because our camera had been stolen. The manager dealing with the situation was unhelpful and submissive of…",2,
The most catchy part about this hotel is the rooftop swimming pool where you can get a nice view but also kinda scary .  Overall the hotel is common as other luxury hotel .  It also link to the Marina shopping mall & casino .,5,
"This is one of the worlds most unique structures and a must to visit. I do find that it is like a mega bus port however. 2000 people trying to check in and out daily is a logistical nightmare but a must do once for anyone who has never stayed here.   Quality wise it is ok without being amazing. However the top deck is sensational in view but extremely expensive. You can come for a day, pay as you go and leave. Probably the better way to go. ",4,
"The view from its top is perfect at night. All around view from the gardens to the river. It's a must go!  The bar is really nice, greatly complemented  by the already mentioned view.  This is judging by the 57th floor as we didn't stay at the hotel itself.",5,
"I've stayed at MBS twice now & it's never let me down. The rooms are simply gorgeous, of course super clean & very well appointed. For not so frequent travellers to Asia beware of the auto charging mini bar - you take the item out, you pay. You can hire an additional small empty fridge for about $10. The breakfast in the lobby restaurant is gorgeous. The rooftop pool is an absolute must do & brekky up there is superb too. The easy access to MRT (train) is great. Of course the high end shopping is at your fingertips and the Bay Gardens are beautiful & definitely worth a visit. One stay was with hubby & kids and the second with my elderly father for the F1 GP - both occasions were perfect, I'll be back!  PS the wi fi speed is super fast which I appreciate as I work online while…",5,
"Stayed for one night only, and a late checkout. You are given a map of the restaurants, they are hard to find, everyone staying in the room needs a card for axis to the pool etc,  otherwise you get told off,if you have a late checkout watch it, our keys were canceled and embarrassing could not get to our room. Buffett we felt was expensive at $55 per person we don't eat enough to get the value. No person cares that you stay there, your just a number, we won't be going back, there is much better in Singapore   ",3,
"Among all the hotels in Singapore, MBS is one of the great place to stay & chill. Room is spacious & with good view If you are checked into the high floor. Long queue for checking in and is always fully booked. Staffs are efficient upon request.   Rememeber if you don't plan to drink any beverages from the from the mini fridge, then don't touch or removed it as the fridge is auto sensored & will be charged to you, even if you will to put it back.   Buffet spread in Rise is good but expansive & please make reservation should you plan to dine there. The front desk can help you to make reservation.",5,
"I reserve this hotel for my friend Dr. Ashok sharma and based on his feed back I am writing this review. Hotel is wonderful and excellent but hotel lobby is very small in tower one, even they can't accommodate 25 guest in their lobby. As usual Check in time is 3Pm and Checkout time is 12PM but several guest arrive early according to their flight arrival so if guest comes early in hotel than there is no space for him in waiting area. Even staff is not polite and don't expect that they ask for drinking water water in the lobby.  Same problem arises while you check out at check out time and your flight is in late evening an if you wish to wait in the lobby there is no space.",4,
"Location - Best location over looking the bay area and the city! We had a room on one of the top floors overlooking the ocean and it was a wonderful view waking up to. There's a mall that connects to the hotel and everything you need is walking distance!  Infinity Pool - Best feature about this hotel! There is an adult-only area and a kids area, so you can have peace away from the shouting children while enjoying the water and the view. There is a lot of people, so go early enough to claim a chair.   Room - For $440 per night, the room was not that great. It looks just like any contemporary hotel room you can find elsewhere. There was a small balcony that you can step out. Overall, it was clean and tidy and properly air conditioned.  Guests - When we went, the hotel was…",3,
"If you come to visit Singapore, this is the place that must be included in your itinerary. It is a must place to visit.  The night view is superb and fabulous.   One of the areas which needs improvement is the toilet. The toilet was wet and dirty.   Overall, the experience is good. 👍👍 ",4,
"Oh my goodness, what a sensational hotel!  From its wonderful location, to the friendly and accommodating staff, this hotel became exciting even before checking into the room!  The accommodation is just sensational.  Comfy beds, large and well stocked bathrooms, to the automated blinds!  And then once you head to the infinity pool on the 57th level, then you just get blown away!!!  The view and layout is just amazing, night and day.  It is a very very busy hotel so be prepared for crowds in the lobby and at the pool area.",5,
"This hotel is just fantastic. Waking up to that magnificent view of the whole Singapore is just the BEST! The INFINITY POOL though crowded but still such pure bliss, great place to meet people from all over the world. Really feels like you own SG from up there! Just fabulous! SKYPARK is amazing! No words are enough to describe it. Oh! And the room is really big! Very nice! JUST PERFECT for a big break especially if you have the roughest week and you just wanna get lost with no hassle! Go Royalty! Trust me! It's serious money but So Worth it! Just don't do it always. Ya don't wanna be broke! haha",4,
"One of the most photographed features of this hotel is the pool. It is an infinity pool and appears to be going over the edge. In person, the pool is huge, much larger than I expected. Most photos show the edge affect and so don't try to show the length. The pool spans the length of the structure topping the three towers. So it is quite long. Even better, there is an adults only section. While at one end, there is a family friendly section with lots of kids, the other end is limited to adults. Although well-signed to that effect, many people are excited about going into the pool and so don't seem to notice. The waitstaff were pretty good at pointing it out to newly arriving guests without being obnoxious to those with kids. On the other side, there are a number of hot tubs, some…",5,
"Stayed here for 3 nights in July in tower 3. The hotel itself is really nice, the infinity pool is amazing and the rooms are very nice. We had a lovely room over looking the gardens and at night this was really pretty to look at. The bathroom was beauitful and the beds very comfortable.  Service - the best service we received was from the non speaking english maid that always nodded her head as us with a great big smile and that's about as far as the service went. For a 5 star hotel I expected a door man at the main entrance but not once was the door opened - there seemed to be plenty of staff standing around but none of them actually did anything in way of customer service. Not once were we greeted at the door or elevators - no customer service what so ever. We did at one stage…",3,
I will choose a zero star or negative rating if I have the choice...   We took valet parking for a wedding lunch after the customer service told us we will not be charged if we give them the complimentary parking coupon from the wedding lunch. It was a totally different story when we picked up Our car. We were told the complimentary was for self drive only. Hello???! Then why you tell us we can use that when we pick up our car. Cheaters! Ripping off people's money! Who will pay $70 parking charges! Ridiculous! ,1,
"Honestly I was quite disappointed at this hotel cuz I had high expectations before I came here. The first time I came to Singapore the hotel was fully booked so I decided to give it a go again this time to see if it is really as good as what the internet appear to be. This place turned out to be a traditional Chinese market where it is flooded with people (went during May which was supposed to be the low season), kids running everywhere and guests were yelling at each other.  Location: Not the most convenient location since there is no subway station around, you need to get around by taxi or you need to walk a long way to the subway station. It is close to the new financial district in Singapore.  Hotel & Facilities: To be fair the hotel is very well designed and has been…",3,
"Marina bay sands hotel was way overcrowded and we did not get anywhere near the expected service for booking 3 x club suites. We had three rooms and found the service quite slow and not personal at all. When visitng the club room for breakfast or end of day we found it to be overcrowded, noisy and lacking quality wines and food that we have experienced in other hotels. It is not a place i would recommend staying after this visit",3,
I just stayed only 1 night at the room with Gardens by the Bay view. The room is OK with big bathroom. I rate 5 star for the service. The best part is the pool. It is worth for the price. I can stay at the pool whole day haha,5,
"Love the location.  Very convenieht and just next to the expo area. Rooms are average, but the view of the bay is outstanding. Balcony is well built - spacious and have enough safety space from the edge. Makes you enjoy rhe view and forget the fear of heights. Pool is a tourist must. High end shops are everywhere. Good for window shopping or just to past the time. ",4,
"Stayed at Marina Bay for a work conference. What a building (s). Architecturally a masterpiece. From the ground it looks like a cruise ship atop of the three buildings!! The view from the top garden/pool area is spectacular!! You can see the ships waing to dock on one side and the beautiful vista on the other. Drinking in the rooftop nightclub is surreal, as it feels on the balcony like your standing in the air....wierd feeling but cool. What a view!! Behind the marina bay is a beautiful lake with light shows...the shopping mall thats part of the marina bay is just something else!!! Very upmarket and is a shoppers dream!! It even has a waterway with gondolas!! The mrt system of which there is a station...mind you its called bayside....if you get off at the marina bay…",4,
"With regards to my recent stay at Marina Bay Sands, certain aspects can be improved. Firstly, the check in process was tedious and ineffective while the service rendered by the employee at the check-in counter was less than satisfactory. The entire process came off as robotic and practiced, she seemed to be in a rush even though I was the only one in the queue. As a 5 star hotel, I definitely expected better service from your staff.  In addition, to access the Skypark, guests have to switch elevators. After using the pool, it is hazardous when guests leave behind puddles of water despite wearing bathrobes. Therefore, causing elevator floors to be slippery. I almost lost my footing as I entered the lift and hence went to the front desk to let the staff there know. The staff on…",2,
"Had a two night staycation with my family to celebrate my little one's second birthday. In short, all three of us enjoyed it and loved the stay. Not disappointed at all.   Check in with Staff Reah was pleasant. We tried to ask for an upgrade to a club room and she tried her best to help. Though there wasn't an available club room for that night, she tried to make up for it by getting us a high level room with nice garden view. She also went the extra mile to ask if we were celebrating any occasion and went on to arrange for a birthday cake for my boy when she found out it was his birthday.   The room was spacious, clean and modern. Curtains were automated. One thing that was missing was that of any sound system, rather unbelievable for such a hotel. But it didn't affect us as we…",5,
The hotel is so expensive but it is worth it. I love the pool which I can view all buildings in Singapore. This is one of the top 3 hotel that I will recommend to stay. I am confidently that you will not disappointed. I will go back again next year.,5,
"Very good hotel, excellent food, service and place. The infinity pool is worth the whole visit and expensive price...but you should be there to believe. Ask for an upper floor room with view to the laguna",5,
"We stayed for two nights in a club level room on level 46 - city view room. The room was spacious and well appointed. Positives included: great view, marble bathroom, prompt ice service to room, great location with access to Gardens by the Bay & MRT station underneath. Pool was busy but accessible. Negatives included: seemingly crappy bathroom products, no exhaust fan in bathroom, staff in lobby not that helpful. However, architecture is amazing and overall was a great experience.",4,
"Luxurious hotel, everything inside, Casino, shopping mall, restaurants, and the amazing infinite pool, it's beautiful , great view of the city , best in night time when all.lights are on, impeccable service , great hotel to.stay.",5,
"I went there with my wife to get a vacation. First of all, it had a very huge lobby and there were a lot of people around that lobby. We were on 24th floor. When we got in the room, it was amazing. Very luxury with a staggering view in the Gardens by The Bay. We stayed for a night. The price is quite expensive,hehe. But it's worth.",5,

"Marina Bay Hotel is one of Singapore's destinations. We tried to book a room, but waited too long prices went up. Not to be disappointed, one evening after dinner, we made the trek across the bay to check out the Marina Bay.  From afar, the building is impressive. Architecturally, it's an amazing work of art, and at night, it's absolutely breathtaking.  You have options for what sort of access you have to the place. We opted for a $25 dollar ticket to the upper deck of the observation area; this includes one cocktail. There's limited access to where you can go, but in general, if you're three attractive chicks, me and my two daughters, you can schmooze your way to other areas to take pictures, and the staff  is somewhat relaxed about that.    People tend to hang at the edge of…",4,
"This pool is an experience on its own, with amazing views of Singapore. The view from our room over the gardens are just as spectacular. Loved this hotel and the staff could not have been any better. We will be back. .",5,
"Lets start with the pool, it does live up to the hype, it is amazing with excellent views across the city. Given that the hotel has over 2000 rooms, many potential guests might worry about how crowded it might get and how easy it will be to get a sunbed. The hotel policy is that you cannot use the pool after you have checked out, so during the day we had no problem getting a sunbed by the pool. Also there is an adult only area, which is slightly more peaceful. It is however quite crowded before 10 am and in the evening. You need to stay for more than one night if you really want to take advantage of the pool. There are some things that could be improved around the pool, for a five star hotel, it was surprising that bottles or glasses of water we not provided regularly during the…",4,
"No doubt it's a great hotel, with loads of facilities but given it's size it lacks personality, shuffling through loads and loads of people plus day guests. We keep going there for an exhibition every year, but for that amount in money we might change premises next time after 3 years ... Worth the experience for once, that's for sure and 2 nights do, but I lost interest to come return every year ...",4,
"I stayed there one night and deeply regretted it. I felt so stupid to fall in a tourist trap.  For the first time of my life, as soon as I arrived in the so called lobby, I wanted to run away.  1/ arriving by taxi with 5 or 6 pieces of luggages: no bell men to help us with the luggage, open the door or whatever.   2/ the so called lobby: about 20 people queuing to check in and out. Actually you have the same number of people queuing in a metre station. What the f...!!!!!!  3/ the room: nothing special. Looks like a novotel or basic business room with no charm. Furnitures look a little bit cheap. What amazed or shocked me was the automatic mini bar: if you take anything,  there is a automatic counter or if you want to have en empty fridge, you need to pay 10 dollars!  4/ the…",1,
"Second time staying at MBS. Booked Twin Premier Room with Garden View (with balcony) both times and rooms are great in every way. Spacious room compared to other hotels in Singapore, good rooftop pool and bar. Thoughtful housekeepers – made up my room and organized our stuff in a very tidy way.  However we were disappointed with the check in experience. We arrived at 12nn which was not yet the check in time but the check in agent was helpful enough to find if there is any available room but to no avail as only King was available. We were told to come back at 3PM or would call us once our room was ready.   Returned to check in desk at 3PM and we were invited to the Sands Lounge for check in. We were again offered King room since there were no Twin rooms available at the time, and…",4,
"This is an expensive, five star hotel. There are a lot of great things about it: the club (if you have access), the pool, the view, the beautiful rooms and many of the staff.   But there were two problems I experienced. These incidents would not ordinarily cost a three- or four-star hotel the same, but for the money MBS charges and for claiming to be a five-star luxury hotel, they damn well do count:   1) I required about five phone calls and four visits to my room to get a desk chair that was appropriate for the desk in the room. I was here, in part, on business, and there are no chairs in the room that are appropriate for sitting at the desk they provide.  Many other Singapore hotels, like the Four Seasons, have great desk chairs.   When I first requested an appropriate desk…",1,
"Finally got some free time to do my review, we came to Singapore during BroadcastAsia 2016 and of course , its quite busy time of year, we manage to get a room at Marina Bay, I booked 4 rooms for this trip and the one the checked me into is on the lower level. The room is quite spacious, amenities is great . Bed is super comfy and the bathroom is also a great size. Would definitely come next trip and bring wifey along and will request a higher floor and maybe the garden view. Also, will find some time to check out the pool ..But if you are attending an expo or seminar at the exhibition centre definitely get this place.",5,
It is a little pricey to stay here.. but its worth EVERY penny. The service is out of this world. The lights went out in our room and they upgraded us to the family suite! Not to mention the awesome panorama view infinity pool on the roof top!,5,
"Yes. We are like many other Singapore travellers. We wanted to experience"" that hotel "" that looks like a ship in Marina Bay Sands and she did not disappoint . We paid extra for club benefits . Afternoon tea and canapés were amazing in club 55 the ladies and service up there were so professional and friendly . The coffee at breakfast on the ground floor ....(we had a quick bite to eat before an early flight) was made out of real milk and was the best coffee I had all holiday !!! Overcast swim but, nearly had the pool to ourselves, thank you 👍😀 do go and also had access to the sunset on the skylark which was amazing ",5,
The pool is awesome but the standard rooms are pretty subpar. We stayed at another hotel in the promenade station area and it had bigger and nicer room with better service. Also VERY inflexible with check out times and room selection because it's popular. Come for the pool but it's worth spending time in other hotels if you're staying longer. ,3,
"The room is bigger than expected. Very clean and comfy. The city view is excellent! If you come to MBS, pay a bit more for the view is definitely worth it. The infinity pool is really not for swimming but photo taking. It's so crowded though not peak season. The shower water pressure is not enough. The food at the RISE BUFFET restaurant is quite decent. ",4,
"I can only recommend to visit the roof top bar and enjoy a few drinks. Yes, the drinks are expensive, but just sitting there and enjoying live is worth it. I've been to Singapore a couple of times, and whenever I get to Singapore, I'll get to this roof top bar at least once...   Haven't stayed in the hotel, so can't say anything about the rooms.",5,
"We went and stayed in their city view deluxe room and it was pretty awesome. The room's view was great, the room facilities was good. The only thing I didn't like was how the fridge operated. They had this censor that will charge you the drink the moment you pick it up. So the fridge is strictly commercial and if you require a fridge you have to rent one from them. As it is, we removed the drinks not knowing it and then was told by our friend that it is chargeable the moment we remove it. So we called their customer service and they said they will dispatch someone up immediately to check on what we consumed (or not consumed). Took 2 calls and close to 30mins for someone to finally appear. The staff was pretty friendly and removed the top shelf for us to allow us to refrigerate…",4,
"We loved the friendly welcome we received from Jonathan at the check in desk and we were absolutely ecstatic to finally be able to stay at this iconic hotel. The rooms are gorgeous and the pool is everything you'd imagine it to be, and more.  Make sure to make full use of this feature - you won't want to leave, so if you want to sightsee around Singapore as well, allow for at least one pool afternoon/evening here. When we checked in, Jonathan assured us that since we had a 10:30pm flight out of Singapore, we could leave our bags in storage on the morning of check-out, go do our sightseeing around town and return at 7pm for a shower in the gym and a change of clothes before heading to the airport.   When we returned on check out day and requested the gym's key card, as per…",5,
"Loved our stay! We spent one night in a Club Suite and it was everything we could have hoped for. Room was huge with a cityview and we also got to check in early. The view at night over the city was amazing! Club 55 is highly recommended and the service was exemplary. Pool is amazing but a little crowded with all the selfie sticks. Dinner at Ce La Vie was nice. Hotel lobby and surrounds (shops, Art Science Museum, Gardens on the Bay) are awesome, you feel like you never need to leave.",5,
"Amazing hotel, very well trained staff (not all to be honest) , from the time you get in the hotel they asked us for the confirmation letter in order for them to tell you which tower you will be. Very friendly staff they replied to my all emails. Requested for a high floor which they have provided it to me it was very much appreciated. The pool is amazing the best time to go there between 11:00 to 15:00 why ? Because the check in and out is going on at this time which is perfect. Be careful there a section for adults only and the other one for adults and kids. Lifeguards and waiters are very friendly and helpful.  Food was so good at the pool and let's be very honest they were very generous with it, and very reasonable prices. Room wise, I would suggest to have a garden view as…",5,
"Stayed here a while back now, in April 2015 for a long weekend. I've always wanted to stay here and my dreams came true. Absolutely superb! everything was amazing. The rooftop pool is definitely the highlight. We loved the afternoon canapes and drinks, so fresh and delicious food was served every day. Staff was always friendly and attentive. I can only say good things about this place. There is so much to do especially with the mall and casino next door. perfect getaway for a long weekend.",5,
"This hotel truly is amazing, the stay is worth it just for the Sky Park/Pool area. Was travelling for work so didn't have to much time to explore the facilities but what I did see was amazing. Get to room with the view over the harbor, absolutely worth it. Rooms are spacious with HUGE bathrooms and bath tubs. So handy having the metro right under the building so getting out around the city is easy. Even if its just for one night its a must do in Singapore!",2,
"My husband and I stayed here for four nights on the end of our honeymoon (we came from the Maldives). I have stayed three other times in Singapore and let me tell you, there are so many better hotels for less money and more luxury.  Our disappointing experience started at check in. Like others had mentioned in their reviews, the front desk associate informed us that they had no more king rooms available (even though we'd booked 6 months in advance on their website) and that we'd have to sleep in a double twin bed room. After arguing with her for about 15 minutes and letting her know it was our honeymoon, voila!, she had a king bed available and let us know we should've let her know it was our honeymoon right away! We shouldn't of had to. I've traveled all of Asia and have never…",2,
"Ever since I saw this hotel on TV, I just HAD to stay there and swim in that pool. Got the opportunity and our friends were envious plus! we managed to get our friends up to our room (38th floor garden view) for drinks and I took them up to the skypark knowing they couldn't actually get into the pool area but that was ok. I was kinda glad as whilst i was relaxing by the pool up there earlier, i was forced to leave due to an overbearing loud male who thought he owned the joint. He came and sat next to me as there were no other empty lounges the place was packed! And even tho i took a selfie with my husband in the pool too, I was quite content with just the one photo good lord I've never seen so many people obsessed with themselves it was a fascinating experience people watching!…",4,
"This place is absolutely incredible! From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you're constantly amazed. We had a great club room on the 42nd floor with an amazing view. Rooms are incredible, so spacious, great decor, very clean. Infinity pool is out of this world, it's hard to believe that the backdrop is real, and it isn't just a green screen. Food is great, and great that you can eat breakfast on the sky deck on floor 57. Everyone should stay at this hotel!",5,
"Only stayed for one night as part of a 4 day weekend in Singapore. So worth the visit, the swimming pool is a must for a relaxing day and the service is very good. Gets a bit crowded in the afternoon but definitely worth it. Was my birthday and they gave me complimentary cake. The view from the room was amazing too. Would recommend and hope to be back some day! ",5,
"Upon check in our reserved room type was unavailable, but once we questioned the check in agent she called a manager who allowed her to put is into our reserved room type. So they had it but didn't want to give it to us and downgrade us with no compensation?  The complex is huge, your feet will hurt. The rooms are drab and boring. The restaurants are extremely expensive and uninspiring. The pool deck operates like a prison and is dirty due to being understaffed and overly crowded. The hotel really should have an additional pool option. Overall besides the pool selfies I think this hotel is a great waste of money, the hotels on sentosa island are much nicer with better more personal service.",2,
"This hotel is simply the quintessence of luxury, comfort and relaxation. The hustle and bustle of trying to get the keys will pay off once you enter your room. Being greeted to the beautiful view of Singapore is just fantastic. Once unpacked and ready to go to the infinity pool, you go up the elevator and once the doors open, you are struck with awe. The infinity pool is just simply the main attraction here, but without a doubt the best place to swim in the world! The food they serve especially the cheese, chocolate, and breakfast was too scrumptious to resist. Lastly I would recommend this place for anyone who would like a taste of luxury in their life.",5,
"My 3rd time to be here. Same thing,  rooms were not that awesome. Checking-in was a task and needed to queue for a while. Room service was attentive and fast. Everything I requested came in efficiently. I requested for special arrangements in view of my special kid, they never promised but they delivered the request with more than that. We were given a room near the lift which was very convenient to the pool access area. Room view was great with the gardens by the bay and the bay area on sight. We had a reservation at Rise restaurant and same they gave us a seat near the buffet which was very spacious that let us enjoy our group (14pax) without other tables being a distraction. Food is ok, not so awesome compared to other hotel buffets. Still have room for improvement.  We were…",4,
"This is such a beautiful hotel. I loved the infinity pool i rave about it because it's a spectacular creation. I admit it is busy but of course it would be for a hotel that large. The room is very nice that we stayed in. It was clean, bed was comfortable etc. I must admit we had to wait quite a long time for checkin as this hotel is very busy. Good location and a beautiful hotel but veeu expensive. I would stay again though. ",5,
"We had always been in awe of this hotel whenever we saw the videos and the pics. So I decided to surprise my husband on his birthday by booking a stay in the grand Marina Bay Sands hotel.   Super crowded when we entered. Check in was quick though it lacked the warmth and friendliness. We had booked the city view room. If you book a garden view room, you can only get a room on the lower floors. However if you pay extra and book the city view room, you will surely get a room from the 19th floor upwards.   The room was pretty standard for a hotel of this class. Comfortable and decent but expected much more for the price we paid. However view of the marina bay from the room was awesome but not exclusive to MBS. Other hotels in marina bay offer the same view at lesser rates and with…",4,
"The views from the 57 floor are spectacular. The infinity pool looked fantastic, this could only be accessed by swiping your key card. Reception was packed with both guests and visitors admiring the internal structures.",5,
"This hotel is stuck in the last decade and hence is not worth the prices they charge. The whole concept of such a large hotel without any personal service is outdated, but MBS thrives on it's iconic architecture. They would be wise to change a great number of things. The room is outdated and nothing special. The mini bar is over stocked with hugely expensive drinks and snacks. If you want to have an empty fridge, you pay S$10. The room wasn't particularly clean, there was no proper ventilation in the bathroom (couldn't see anything in the mirror for half an hour after a shower!), there is NO furniture on the balcony... Not even a simple chair! And the AC is a disaster, soooo noisy! For checking in you have to wait in line, as you have to for breakfast. All the F&B in the hotel…",1,
"Stayed a couple of nights back in June with husband and daughter.  Most important for anyone staying at the Marina Bay Sands was the roof top, infinity pool! Yes, the pool was spectacular! Only hotel guests with card access can enter the pool area. That being said, it was so, so crowded! We went early morning, afternoon and evening and it was crowded every time! Overall, the guests at the pool are not super loud or rowdy, but just the sheer huge number of people taking selfies (us included), was a bit of a turnoff. In addition, it's difficult for staff to keep the place clean with all the guests there, so the pool deck was a bit unkempt.  We stayed in a premier garden view room and the view was stunning, overlooking the Garden by the Bay. If you request a room on a higher floor,…",4,
"I saw an amazing view when the first time I saw marina bay. Singapore too good to be your place to visit, great view, about transportation so fast also. No traffic jam, no polution. Small city but look so great. Next time will visit singapore for holiday.",4,
"Firstly the reason I go back to MBS as the first experience is wonderful. my second trip on 30/8/16 is utterly disappointing despite giving allowance. service man TAT is attentive and responsive , other than that my experience is perhaps bad luck which happen to me only . 1st upon check in discover that the relax chair is full of blonde hair by the side and pubic hair being swept by the side of the chair to hide. 2nd at the pool I pass the wrong access card to my wife which disallow me to enter , I request to enter and walk out from the pool but the lady security offer to escort me in and out which makes me feel like a convict and everyone will be wondering why do I have a staff to escort me like a prisoner which I rejected therefore make a call to my pregnant birthday wife to…",2,
"I lived in this hotel a few years ago when newly opened. The experience was not good, so picked other choices when I re-visited Singapore. The environment was dusty and remote, and it costed you at least SG 2 more to take taxi. The bed was small and room design was not user friendly, etc. Long queue for check in/out and breakfast ... My experience is totally different this time. All nearby areas are developed and my room faces the nice view of Garden by the Bay. The location is convenient, connected to shopping centres and MRT through covered walkway.  The room is greatly improved, with comfortable beds and pillows, good for both business and leisure.  There is lots of storage space, with enough mirrors at appropriate locations, and spacious bathroom etc. There are many…",5,
I visited the hotel last year with my mother. To be honest with you the reason was that rooftop pool!I had to swim there!A MUST!Our room had view of the gardens by the bay and the view was spectacular!Worth a visit for sure!Expect high prices...Try to visit the pool at night as well!,5,
"Thanks for your hospitality. It was a great time staying at the MBS. Superb service and top notch care and pride in all the staff I crossed paths with. The premier room was extremely spacious and the toilets, FANTASTIC. The Bay view was great, although paying a premium for City view would have been far better.  Pity the haze, but that only means I have to come back again to see clearer views in the near future. Pricing is fair since every steep dollar paid gets steep good service and quality in return. The infinity pool was magical. Privileged access for hotel guests only so that made it even more premium to stay at MBS. The jacuzzi was sensational and the pool, well magical. Seeing the sunrise, mid day sun and sunset from the 57th floor dipped in a pool, is simply a chance of a…",5,
"Hotel of the future. Everything was great. The pool at the 57th floor is worth the visit. We had a suite at the 52nd floor with an incredible view of the city. It s breathtaking, especially at night. It was pricey, but it is once in a lifetime experience and the best way to visit SIngapore.",5,
"Very spacious room with automated curtain, amazing views and good service. However, beware of the volume of people at check in, the queue does move fast. Same experience at breakfast, expect a queue at peak time and lifts will get busy coming down aroung lunch time as most people will check out around that time too. Overall, this is a must place in Singapore specially the breathtaking infinity pool at the roof top. Best time to be up there is before sunset and whilst the light show comes on at 8pm. The staff at the rooftop restaurant mantain a consistent level of service even though it can get busy. Lovely views across the city.The hotel is connected to a massive shopping mall with an array of shops and restaurant.",5,
"First, keep in mind that this hotel is now essentially an icon of modern architecture representing Singapore in many ways.  3 tall towers with a cantilever platform across the top with pool, restaurants, and more - breathtaking.  But there is more.  The location is not the closest to business interests, but the services offered, including the huge number of restaurants and shops, entertainment including museums and theatres, waterfront, proximity adjacent to Gardens by the Bay, etc.  Rooms are nice, hotel is well run, nothing bad to say.",5,
This hotel was the epitome of luxury. From the string quartet that plays in the hotel lobby to the delectable restaurants to the high end fashion this hotel lacks nothing. I literally felt no need to leave. The infinity pool fulfills all of the hype! There is poolside waitress service of tasty food and drinks.,5,
"Everything was great. Concierge service was very good. Room was big, and clean. This is an amazing place, very busy and full of people. You need to stay there to visit the pool. They offer freshen up service if you have to leave late and we have already checked out.  Breakfast is not included in the room rate. We arrived early at the hotel, before usual check in time, and we were given a room on the 2nd floor which was quite disappointing because there was noise from the busy street outside.",4,
"Simply an amazing hotel, unlike anything we had previously stayed in.  The rooms are a good size with nice amenities.  Ours overlooked the gardens on level 23.  Perfect at the price and no need to pay more for a city view.  The Sky Park is fabulous, we spent all day up there.  So much to look at, with great service.  Loved using the Fitness centre on Level 55, nothing beats running on a treadmill with such a great view.",5,
The room was very spacious and the view from it was great! I especially love the bathroom. I would recommend anyone to come here and stay. You should check out the rooftop pool too. It's the best! The view is to die for.,5,
"nothing bad to say about this place  The pool and the views are breathtakingly beautiful. Food excellent ,staff very helpful  Great poolside bar  Local shopping just across the road as well  Dont think about this hotel book it ",5,
At first glance this hotel does not seem real but the closer you get to its stunning towers the more your jaw will drop. The rooms were great and the convenience of the hotel having everything you could possibly want is irresistible. Great shopping dining and entertainment is also attached to the hotel. We had the club suite and were offered cocktail hour daily which was incredible. The food was exquisite and the booze flowed freely. The service here was personable and spot on. Their friendliness was second to none. A most enjoyable stay in such a great city. ,5,
"A hotel/resort for adults...more for relaxing..near to Garden by the bay and City hall. Spacious room, nice view in city view room @ high floor( 29 & above) floor 6 and below is blocked by The Shoppe.",4,
"Ok, hotel is very big, but still everything works really well. If a change, worth investing a premier room with the city view. Stunning views over the city. Rooms are very big in that category.   Pool is of course something that this hotel is very famous of. Might be very crowded, but some areas for adults only.   We had breakfast downstairs - a bit crowded but still easier than just walking to the city. The mall is huge and a lot of restaurants in the mall.   If you have a chance - this hotel is definately worth going - also enjoy the sunsets on the roof top restaurants.   Truly a 5 star hotel and special mention to concierce service , who found us the perfect restaurants even though my husband didn't have long pants with him. ( we were travelling in indonedia before coming to…",5,
"The scale and design of this preposterous piece of architecture that dominates the marina is deceptive. The 2000 odd rooms (!) are divided into three towers avoiding the cruise liner corridors to infinity I was expecting, and are surprisingly quiet. Opting for a club level gets you a higher room and the pleasant airy club room with free flowing champagne to accompany inventive canapés early evening. It can get crowded and it can get a bit noisy if there are ill tempered children close by, tedious lounge music too. The staff are astonishingly friendly and efficient, I was amazed to be remembered by name & room number the following morning at breakfast or by the pool. The best time to visit the infinity pool on the roof and not get a selfie stick in the eye seemed to be the fallow…",4,
"main focus is property. very nice property, huge and magnificent with swimming pool on its top floor. main problem is wherever you want to go within the property you need to change elevator several times. good branded toiletries with huge bathroom and overall satisfactory but service could have been better.",3,
"We arrived a little bit too early but it was no problem at all. They said the room is not ready so we waited 15 minutes. After that the room was still not ready so they offered us an upgrade! Thanks!! First things first, of course the first way was directly to the insane pool. Wow what a view! Really amazing. The room was really beautiful and the service was great. All in all, really a great place.",5,
"Marina bay sands has literally everything. Shopping centres, theatre, restaurants, waterfront, etc. the facilities are sophisticated and modern. We spent whole wandering around the complex and it got even prettier at night. Great place to visit during rainy day!",5,
"For the price...it is not worth the throngs of tourists one must wade through to even get into the lobby. I wouldn't even consider it a lobby, it's just a busy retail space with little attention paid to guests attempting to check in. The rooms are of course nice, clean and large...but overall a pretty drab and boring design. The saving point was the amazing view from the room. We had a city view room on the 48th floor and the view definitely did not disappoint. What did disappoint is the infinitely pool on the 57th floor. It's so overcrowded and messy with deck chairs in every possible place a chair can be squeezed, towels tossed everywhere, leftover food trays, and it is so jam-packed with loud tourists, the impact of the spectacular view is tarnished. I visited here 6 years…",3,
I always pay a visit here whenever arriving in Singapore as it's a big symbol of this country. There are 03 towers with a lot of luxury shops and restaurants. Casino is famous here but they don't allow to take pictures unless you are a guest. There are some corridors outdoor so you can see Singapore scenery which is absolutely beautiful at night ,5,
after our Thailand Trip we fly for a few days to singapore. in the Hotel Marina Bay Sands....Great Hotel. for me the best Hotel worldwide. we stay in Floor 47. the viewpoint was indescribable. dreamlike. fantastic service and the pool on the roof is indescribably beautiful. ich komme wieder. sicher,5,
"Stayed five nights in MBS in June. Really enjoyed the beautiful infinite pool on the roof. Also, liked the free admission into the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, where it offered 360-degree views of the Singapore skyline.",4,
We recently stayed 2 nights at this wonderful hotel in a Club Room. Check-in was good with a dedicated area for Club Rooms. Our room was lovely with wonderful city views and great views of the nightly light show. Our only problems with the room were that the shower took a very long time to get warm and the pressure was not great. The hairdryer was also next to useless. The Club Lounge itself was the busiest we have ever experienced but coped well with the crowds and the food and service were great. Swam in the rooftop pool a couple of times for the obligatory photos and it was extremely busy even at 7am but they did block the children's pool for lap swimming. Overall this was a great experience that we wanted to do once but is an extremely crowded and huge hotel and very…,4,
What can i say  Famous for the pool but i didn't like the fact ppl were walking from towers to the pool thru main lobby in gowns should have another access for hotel guests  Other than that as you enter main entrance you are hit by the size this hotel is enormous there is a coffee shop which is partially hidden so you can enjoy your drinks in peace  The ride to level 57 is very smooth and quick  The views are amazing from The sky  You can have a quick look from the free access point or you can purchase tkts and walk around the semi circle of tower one and enjoy the cafe and gift shop  You can only access the pool if you are a hotel guest and there is a restaurant on the top across from the pool at tower 3  Tower 3 has a bridge linking you to the gardens by the bay to one side…,4,
Best hotel ever. Staff was amazing. Perfect location. Singapore is beautiful and spend 5 nights in this AMAZING hotel was even better. No regrets!!!!!!  we requested to be changed from floor 2 because we wanted to enjoy the view. The lady at front desk make our dream come true and more; room at floor 12 with a view to the Garden of the Bay. Definetly we will be back!!!!,5,
"Staff service was impeccable but the one big sore thumb was there was a lot of tourist. Hotel lobby was like a bus station. Breakfast venue at lobby and 57th floor was jam packed. Lifts were packed and the infinity pool, although beautiful was full of selfie stick yielding people. It was impossible to swim. Every deck chair was taken. We were on 50th floor with amazing views but we could hear the bass from the club on 57 floor on Sunday night. Loved the celebrity chef restaurants with their special promotions including social hours on Tues where 1 selected cocktail at each restaurant was at 50% off. Room was spacious and comfortable. Housekeeping eager to please. There's a small hotpool in the gym which was nice. Walking distance and connected on 6th floor to Garden by the Bay…",4,
"Monstre infrastructure but run really bad. Singapore is built around this area but the hotel is disappointing. They have an amazing pool with a stunning view, but this is all. Pool is not hygienic at all, kids jump into the water, bar service is bad and their english worse. Potentially the best hotel worldwide, actually an overrated and overpriced place where to spend your vacation.",1,
We stayed here for 3 nights.. we thought its kind of expenive and dint think it would be worth the money we paid.. But tell you what... its totally worth it... It has awesome swimming pool which is only for the people who stay here....Once you dive in the fool u wouldnt feel like coming out of it... the view of the pool is simply awesome during the sun set and at the night when u can see whole of the singapore during the night... it has Awesome view... And plus its got a casino down stairs which is huge...U just need to carry ur passport and u are in... it feels like u in Vegas... Awesome experience all toghter... The breakfast for indian cruisine is on a different desk and has a wide spread of options... U can book with or without breakfast packages.... The property is little…,5,
"Stayed one night here as a gift for my husband's birthday. We really enjoyed our stay. The front desk clerk, Aslam, was very helpful and polite. He did his best to find us a room earlier than the check-in time of 3pm and even arranged temporary wifi and pool access for us while we were waiting for our room. He also arranged for us to have a late checkout at 12pm. He also noticed it was my husband's birthday (from his ID) and wished him a happy birthday!  We started our stay with lunch at Sky on 57 for my husband's birthday - I've reviewed this separately (it was great!). We then spent our afternoon having a dip in and lazing by the infinity pool. It's a great pool with great views and it's not too crowded because access is restricted to hotel guests only.  Had dinner at Din Tai…",4,
"싱가폴 사는 사람입니다. 몇년 사이에 방값은 두배나 올리고 서비스는 갈수록 최악이네요. 수영장말고 뭐 없습니다. 그 수영장도 올라가 보세요. 목욕탕보다 더 빽빽해요. 물은 얼마나 드러운지.. 로비고 쇼핑몰이고 시장통입니다. 체크인하는데 최소 한시간 기다려야 하구요. 직원들 엄청 오만하고 서비스 마인드 최악입니다. 플러튼 호텔이나 만다린 오리엔탈이 훨씬 좋아요. 수영장 뷰도 뒤지지 않습니다. 진심으로 여긴 비추네요. Service is lousy, all the staff are very arrogant.. All the place is so crowded even u want to check out, at least you need to wait for 1 hour. Swimming pool is dirty and packed with peoples. Overpriced. Better go to other hotel like a Fullerton or mandarin oriental.",1,
"My husband and I spent one night (and only one!!! sniff sniff) in the beautiful and iconic MBS in February, 2016. My friend who lives in Singapore encouraged us to book at least one night here. It's by far the most expensive hotel we've ever booked, and so, we were slightly aghast that it was filled to the brim with tourists when we arrived. (""How can so many people afford this?"" we kept asking each other). Trust us to travel during the Chinese New Year, when all of passported China is traveling, too. We had to wait 45 minutes to get checked in because of the crowds, but the desk agent, perhaps taking pity on us, gave us a room on the 45th floor with incredible views. We stepped out onto our little balcony and saw the entire Singapore bay, with the beautiful Gardens by the Bay…",5,
"If you go in the evening,you can see the sunset.There is usually not much rain in that area and the sky is very clear.It is very peaceful and tranquil.There are also some nice food places to eat there.",5,
Stayed in a premier room with city view for 2 nights with family.  The swimming pool was the main reason with proximity to Gardens by the Bay also.    We were given a 30th floor room.  It still.has a good view.of.the.city.  Both day and night views were magnificent.    The room was spacious with a large bathroom.  The beds were comfortable and the resting lady chair great for.relaxing to enjoy the view outside the windows.  Amenities.were ok but not wonderful.   Pity they don't have nespresso machine but only gave you instant coffee sachets.   The view at the pool were wonderful.  Swim quality was only good in the morning since it becomes crowded.after 9:30am.  I must say I didn't try a night swim.    Lobby at Tower 1 is always packed with tourists.  Didn't try breakfast but…,5,
"When you're down with negativity or perhaps knocked down by life, or perhaps need a reason to loathe in luxury, stay at marina bay sands, and there you go, the mood uplifts barely by sight of this luxurious property, ah the infinity pool!! you definitely can't get out of it, the sight of entire Singapore, the aroma of fresh food served on top floor, the basement mall at the hotel, or the buffet bf, I mean you name it and they do it,worth every single penny you spend. Try their spa and trust you'll never regret it. The room is an abuse toward called luxury, it is better than that, or should I say it is SINGAPORE I thought of.",5,
"We stayed at Marina Bag Sands for 3 nights on our honeymoon. We arrived at 5am and were very tired from a 13hr flight. The staff were amazing and gave us a room on the third floor so we could sleep and then proceeded to move us up to the 38th floor for our actual 3 night stay - this was a lovely gesture as we were worn out! For our whole stay, we were treated with this high level of hospitality.   The hotel itself is huge and relatively impersonal. The rooms are spacious and modern, but there is a feeling of mass tourism about them. With that said, the facilities were clean and plentiful. MBS dominates the skyline in Singapore - it looks amazing at night. The novelty factor heavily outweighs the impersonal feeling of the hotel rooms.   Obviously, the highlight for us (as I'm…",5,
"I stayed there for one night with my boyfriend. The room was big, clean and modern, the position is very strategic because it's close to all amenities. The staff was kind.  There is a famous outdoor pool (with restaurants and bar) that is very big and amazing, especially for the view of the city. The pool is a must see place.  On the other side, there is not breakfast included and the hotel barely matches the quality and services standards for a five star hotel.  Overall, i would go back there again. ",4,
"Me and my husband spent a weekend in marina bay, and it was fabulous. We were positively impressed by its great location and its out-of-this-world design. The infinity pool is a must if you visit Singapore,",5,
"View was simply stunning, however i am not sure that it was a good value for the money. For the room service we ordered chocolate chip cookies, and the exact same cookies were sold at 7 eleven, for 600% less of the room service price. Disapointing that a five star establishment wasn't able to bake their own cookies. Pool of course is magical. All I can say, is if you can afford it, go for it. Would definitely recommend this a friend. ",4,
"a very nice place and perfect clean, cheap and easy suitable for families, alone or co-workers. good",5,
"Best stay in a Hotel ever. Stayed in a Club room with City view on 50th floor. Stunning view by day and night. Infinity pool is the top Highlight of that stay, unfortunatly a bit crowded during the evening and night hours. We stayed two nights as check in was at 14-15 pm only and check out already at 11 am and was a bit reluctant to pay 500€ just for half a day.",5,
"Stayed here for a work conference in July. Hotel was nice but enormous, I personally prefer smaller hotels. Sky deck is a great touch. Rooms are decorated nicely but one thing I didn't like was that the mini bar was fully stocked and had sensors so you have to pay for a fridge to keep your own water in etc.",4,
"My sister and I went for a drink in the bar at the top on Marina Bay Sands on 16th August. We are not rich, but wanted to see the view from the top of the hotel, and expected good service. However, the bar was very busy, with several tills not working, so after paying for our (expensive, warm) beer, my sister had to wait for ages at the bar for her change. When we questioned this, the waiter was very rude, blamed the lack of tills, even though one was open and he could have just taken the money out, and when he did give us the change he practically threw it at us. Our impression was that the bar staff were all out for the big spenders, and not bothered about people who were there for a once-in-lifetime experience. Very disappointing.",3,
"Me and my husband spent one night in Marina Bay Sands. I have to say, the building is really impressive. We were the lucky ones to get an upgrade to suit which was huge, around 100 square meters, on 52nd floor and even had a cardio machine. Unfortunately, we stayed only one night. The goal was to see the famous swimming pool. And I have to say it is definetely something you have to see if you go to Singapore. However, it is very crowded even though they try to limit the number of people as you can only access the pool with the room card. So going to the swimming pool after check-out is not possible.   I loved the gym on 55th floor!",5,
"I stay there 2 night to accompany my father for business. They have a great place to meeting, so cozy. And i was enjoying view from the top. Expensive but It is Worth. But this hotel is too crowded. I will come again, perhaps.",4,
"Such a lovely place to stay, the pool was incredible! Garden view definitely better than the city view. Staff were so friendly and great location (close to the underground train) little pricy but everywhere in Singapore is and expect to pay a small fortune for alcohol. ",5,
"Expensive but such a treat - so worth it to stay in such a unique and iconic building and for the exceptional views from the room and the wonderful infinity pool. At no time was the pool too busy as some of the reviews have stated and we visited 3 times - on arrival at the hotel (early afternoon), in the evening for night views and then in the morning for sunrise. Just watch the walkways around the pool as they are quite slippery. The hotel should really deal with this.",5,
We planned the whole trip around this hotel and we were not disappointed. From the moment you step into the lobby it leaves you speechless. We booked a superior room for three and it worth every dollar we spent and even more. The view the quality of services the bathroom. Everything was amazing. I couldn't even say no to the gym of the hotel. But its everything about the pool what a magic. Lifetime experience. One of the landmark hotels that you have to visit once in your lifetime. ,5,
"Stayed in a suite so no complaints about the room, Best out look over the park with balcony, city nice but a city. Staff are great, friendly and helpful. Food very good and of course the pool ,,,, well that's special as we all know and worth the stay for this alone. I could go on but you need to experience this for your self.",4,
Room is above average. The only main selling point is the infinity pool. Crowded throughout the day perhaps the best time to swim is early morning. While the rest of the day you can swim in your bathtub.,5,
"We stayed in this hotel for one night in Orchids Suite with Marina View.   We booked transfers through the hotel and had a very spacious and comfortable car! When we arrived, someone welcomed us and took us to our suite where we made our Check In.  The suite was very spacious and very well laid at 51st floor. It includes a living room, dining room, dressing room, bathroom and a very spacious room. We were lucky because we had one of the largest suite with the best view because it had a view of the Marina side room and Garden by the Bay side living room !!  As regards the room service, it's great, the food is good and plentiful and the service is fast. The staff is very intentioned we had a birthday cake while the date was in 6 days.  We were at the famous swimming pool and there…",5,
"This hotel has got everything. Luxury, shopping, food and views you will die for. Train action at the bottom of the hotel, casino and shopping mall within the hotel and the bar at level 54 with infinity pool makes it my favourite hotel of all times. My score is 10/10. I just loved it. ",5,
"i stayed there in tower 3, it is way too expensive for a room since only u get to have a room if u r staying and all the other amenities are being and can be used by the visitors also except the swimming pool on the top floor. casino can be used by the people having passports only don't forget to carry that if u wish to visit there. i felt that all people staying there were only rushing towards the swimming pool immediately after the checkin. overall you will not feel much calm and private in the hotel. it is constantly rushed all the time like an airport. even there will be a long Queue for the breakfast.  The restaurants in the morning are so rushed and the plates they provided were also so heavy it was difficult to carry the food upto your table all the time. being obviously…",3,
"Well as you would expect the hotel has a very impressive look as it sits in the middle of the harbor area with the bay on the front and the botanic gardens on the backside.  now this hotel cost about 3 to 4 times as much as the other hotels in the same class but why you ask.  Well it location to the Casino its in the same building so that a big plus for anyone how is looking for that and then there is the Sky deck pool and restaurants.  It is a fun experience to be on top looking down and out a crossed the city. The pool covers the 60% of the space so even with 100's of people in the pool you still have a bit of room but don't think you will ever have much space to yourself. very limit space for lounge chairs ""think Cruise ship"" and the challenge to find even one open chair is a…",4,
Stayed in July 2016 as part of a stopover on the way through to Europe. The infinity pool itself is worth staying at the hotel. Were given a free upgrade at check-in to a room with a balcony. Gym/fitness facilities are excellent. Absolutely loved the stay.,5,
"The Hotel is amazing as design, interiors and staff organization, The swimming pool at the 57th is stunning and an exciting esperience, but for 400 Usd/Night for a basic room I expected a bit more. There are better places in Singapore where to stay for that rate.",4,
"Me, my uncle and 2 kids were staying for 2 nights over the weekend. 2 adult card access and 2 children card access were given upon check in. On the last day, kids insist to swim at 10am, and we called service hotline from the room and we were given late check out until 1pm. I was told to go down to lobby exchange the card access because the cards will automatically disabled by 11am. When approaching conciarge to exchange the key access card, as usual standard practice in hotel all over the world, the staff will ask the room number and the name of the guest. However they ask additional question the ""date of birth"", and I forgot my uncle birthdate.

"This is not a regular luxury hotel, select this if you want to have an experience. Not surprising, as the Sands group comes from Las Vegas. The skypark is worth it to come here. The infinity pool, the palm trees and the great restaurant here makes it more than worthwhile. This pool, the view on the city and the gardens let you step into the future of urbanisation.",5,
"you cannot go to Singapore without  once staying here, it is THE place to be. the pool on the roof is something to experience. i arrived at night and it was crowded at a level you could not imagine, there was just no space left. i had to wait until 11 when it closes to see how beautiful it is and what a feeling it gives you being so high with an infinity pool, i had a drink at spago and enjoyed the view. in the morning at chack out the pool is also godd,when the crowd leaves. the room was very nice with a vew on the gardens, consider to choose this rather than marina view,which can be experienced from other places as well. the reception is a perfect machine for checkin -check out - lugagge - fitness room. if you look for customization this is not the place. this is a massive…",5,
"One does not travel to Singapore and not visit the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Hopefully one gets to stay there to experience the hotel, in particular, the infinity pool as this is the only way you will get to swim in it, or even get close to the pool unless you're a staying guest. This actually works in favour of guests as there are so many people visiting the famous hotel. There are bars and a few restaurants at the top, as well as an observatory deck all open to the general public.  Firstly upon arrival the bellhop (is that what they're called?) were so efficient. They knew it was too early for us to check in but took our luggage, gave us a ticket and told us to come back at 3pm to check in and hand the same ticket back and someone will bring our bags to our room.

Visited with my partner for a getaway from Hong Kong and chose Marina Bay Sands. Wasn't disappointed with the product or service at all. The pool was always packed but it was worth the wait for deck chairs as we lazed the day away. Overall satisfied despite the price point and would be tempted to return if there are any great promotions.,5,
"Well what can I say this hotel has the wow factor, view from the infinity pool was breath taking. I had the luxury of being upgraded to a suite and omg what an experience. Totally commend this hotel what an amazing place, would definitely recommend to anyone going to Singapore, top star rating, thank you for such a fab stay",5,
"This is the 5th time i had stayed in this hotel, all the time I am impressed wtih the view of the hotel but always think the customer service is ok, but my last stayed was the last straw that makes me have to comment and give feedback about my experience. We had checked out from the hotel but wanted to have our lunch at the simming pool cafe and we stayed in tower 1. Understanding the tight security they have for the top floor, so  upon checkout we reminded the receptionist that we would like to have our lunch at the swimming pool cafe and to make sure we will have no problem assessing the cafe. This was reassured by the receptionist. But when we go up the lift to level 57 from tower 1, we were stop by the security gate and the hotel staff refused to let us enter the area to…",1,
"I had high expectations for this hotel but it was even greater than I imagined. I absolutely loved the infinity pool and spent hours there. It was something out of a dream and I must say it made me feel like a queen. The rooms are also very clean and have amazing views. However, it is pricey but if you are willing to splurge, Marina Bay is the way to go!",5,
"We (Mum, Dad and teenager) stayed here on our last night of our three week holiday round Asia and what a way to end our fantastic holiday!  Our dual aspect room was on the 25th floor with amazing views over the bay and the city. The room was beautifully presented and very comfortable.  We headed straight for the infinity pool and although busy there was plenty of space to enjoy the incredible views . My daughter and I decided to get up early the following morning to watch the sun rise and  although the pool was busy, it was not as busy as the night before.   An amazing experience and would return to this hotel.",5,
Went here for drinks - amazing hotel and bar - fantastic views across Singapore - worth going to see the sunset and laser show - there are two bars located on the top of this impressive building - you can eat it just sample their array of fine cocktails and other drinks - not cheap but well worth the visit  ,5,
Infinity pool and cityscape is the only reason to spend a night. For this you pay a lot but it is worth the experience at least if it is your first time in Singapore. The hotel is a landmark.   Rooms are ok but a bit old fashioned. Reception looks like a crowded bus station counter.  There are hundreds if not thousands of guest so it looks always very crowded. Also the pool is quite crowded espeically in late afternoon and sunset (better to try early in the morning before check out) We did not have breakfast included as it is ridicously expensive.  ,4,
"This Hotel is amazing. The infinity pool is such a fabulous experience. Standing in the pool sipping  a cocktail whilst surveying the skyline of Singapore. Incredible!! Our room on the 19th floor was very clean and beautifully decorated and furnished. The beds were extremely comfortable and the attention to detail was what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. We had a huge terrace overlooking Singapore harbour, though I did find it odd that there wasn't any  outdoor seating. I went up to the pool at around 06:30 to watch the sunrise and it was very busy even then. Fantastic selection at breakfast, pretty much every taste is catered for. Brilliant location with great transport links. I would love to return one day.",5,
"I stayed here for 4 nights and the stay was awesome.  Had a view over the city which looked great at night.  The pool on the roof was one of the main reasons i stayed here, and it didn't disappoint. Swimming in this one-of-a-kind pool is weird as you're 50 stories above the ground.  The hotel is ideally situated and close to a lot of attractions.",5,
"Perhap there are alot of great hotels on the world but this is the best place that my family experienced.Every thing is perfect, located in the complex area where you can have any thing you need .I wish to come back many time.",5,
"I have to confess the reason we chose this hotel was because of the pool and were worried it would be invaded by tourists. We were very pleasantly surprised to discover a luxury hotel with the feel of one. Once you are done with checking in, which is the only part where it feels more like Las Vegas than a quiet resort, you take an elevator to your beautiful room. I believe all views are nice, but ours was outstanding, on the very last floor and with a view of the city. Breathtaking. We had chosen to be at the club/concierge level with access to the club lounge and that was fabulous. The food was exceptional, the room fantastic with views in every direction. The only draw back is the fact that the lounge is more or less close when not in full service. No access if you just want…",5,
"My first time in Singapore and I stay here, I feel so lucky, I was blown away by the size and the glamour. The hotel is very, very good, service is fantastic, rooms are very clean and comfortable we even had a visit from our Guest Service Agent asking if there was anything else that she could do to help us enjoy our stay, nice touch. The views are to die for especially at night when the Super Trees are lit up. The gym is excellent; the Infinity Pool is a marvel, the shops are stylish and they even have a 7/11.  I could go on and on but I think you get my drift, this is a fantastic hotel and I cannot wait to return to Singapore, there was nothing here that I disliked. Excellent-well done.",5,
"So many reviews, so will be quick. Stayed as a family (husband and two children (5 & 7) in an Orchid Suite (as recommended by travel agent friend). Simply impeccable service, stunning room (with stunning bay views). This hotel is quite possibly the best in the world.  Absolutely huge hotel, so we were somewhat relieved to receive the 'extra-efficiencies' that are provided when staying in a suite (particularly when travelling with young children), i.e. express check-in and 'club breakfast'. The pool is astonishing, but very busy afternoon / evening (selfie-stick is possibly more essential than even a towel, going on the number evident - but, I guess, given the suroundings, why wouldn't you?) Wine list, room service, mini-bar, amenities are second to none.  However, all features…",5,
"This hotel is   so-called Singapore symbol. when you travel, staying this hotel is  MUST and .DUTY. Pool ’s  view  is  gorgeous. But,water was opaque,that was  disappoint. Because of  crowd Without this hotel,your vacation in Singapore is insufficient,I thought.",4,
"We stayed in 2 rooms facing different parts of the city, 1 room with balcony with the view of bay area, watching the light show of Garden of the Bay in our room is quite cool.  Kids played in the INFINITY POOL at night.  The view from the Oberservation Deck was magnificent.  Bruno liked that super-sized bathtub and stayed in the locked bathroom for hours, I had to knocked the door at 2am to drag him out.  The view from the roof looked better in the morning.  Bruno had a good time in the INFINITY POOL and Jucizzi.  Our breakfast in SKY ON 57 was a nice memory.  Our 14-year old boy Bruno said he would come back with mom and our grand children.  Hope we do not need to wait for too long.",5,
"We stayed two nights at Marina Bay Sands and booked a Club Room with city view on 41st floor.  The check in was very nice and quick, the guy from the reception guided us to the floor and showed us the room.  The room was very large with a stunning view on Singapore and the Marina Bay. We just stood there and looked down to the city for half an hour. The view is also perfect for the 8.00 pm laser and light show. The bed was comfortable, large bathroom with shower and bathtub.   The club rooms includes access to the club area on 55th floor where complementary breakfast, afternoon snacks and drinks are provided - the amazing view on Singapore or the sea included. Breakfast was good, eggs made to order, Asian cuisine, good dairies and fresh fruit. In the evening warm and cold snacks…",5,
"Great hotel, fantastic location, unbelievable pool. There are many things to like about the Marina Bay Sands, but because of its size and popularity there are many things that disappoint. The hotel is mobbed with thousands of people. Everything from check-in to the elevators, to breakfast requires waiting in a long line. The hotel staff were mostly helpful but frustrating at times.",3,
"This hotel has everything you need for an enjoyable stay...large rooms, great views, impressive pool, and convenient location (mall and public transport access from the hotel). That being said, it was definitely a splurge for us. I think it was worth it just to experience all of the hype, but I'm not sure I would feel the need to stay here again.",5,
"We were very fortunate to spend 2 nites in this stunning, luxury hotel. An experience we will never forget. The views and ambience from the roof top pool are indescribable. The hotel is a must do, at least once whilst in Singapore, if you want to have a splash out!",5,
"We stayed in the Orchid Suit which was nice a good size for a hotel room but it simply wasn't as special as we we expecting. It was just a nice room nothing to make you want to go back tomorrow. The pool area is obviously pretty mind blowing and is definitely worth checking out even if you don't stay at Marina Bay. The other facilities through out the hotel are also very nice no mater what you choose to do.   The bonuses with the suits and club room are great. With breakfast options in several dining areas around the hotel. We at breakfast every day on level 55 which was a great spot to either look over the city or out over the bay. Afternoon tea and happy hour is also complimentary for club and suit rooms, allowing you to enjoy and open bar and your choice of great meats.…",4,
"This is a must visit place, if you are going to Singapore. The best part is ofcourse their infinity swimming pool & the Lobby area. Rooms are also very spacious. The property is situated at a very good location near to many restuarants and gardens. Service is also good as they also allowed us early check in. However as the property is very big and busy, it takes a little time for check in and check out but staff makes sure that they are quick enough to do all the formalities.",5,
"2 nights at MBS (Fri-Sun) the hotel is beautiful and our luggage was brought up very quickly to 48th floor city side. One entire wall was window. The bellman showed us the room and pointed out things around the city from the wall window, he was very welcoming.  We had 2 adults and 3 older kids.  Had a bed, sofa bed and they brought in a twin bed for us so my daughter slept in front of that window.The bathroom was gorgeous with separate shower room and toilet room. We went up to the pool at 7 am Sat had choice of any lounge chair.  It really never got crowded. Rooms are only issued 4 key cards for the pool, I had to go back to the desk and beg nicely for 1 more so our whole gang could go to the pool together and they did give me an extra.  Apparently if you have more than 4…",4,
"One of the most amazing hotels I've been in! The infinity pool was out of this world and had the most incredible views. I loved the pool service; the waiter was very attentive and funny. Also, the rooms were very spacious with great views. I would love to return to this hotel in the near future.",5,
"What a magnificent hotel...Everything is big...the hallway, the lobby, the elevators and the rooms... We stayed on the 50th floor, city view. Room with living area, 2 large TVS. Everthing luxurious and with great taste. The bathroom was huge with all amenities you need, replenished daily. The swimming pool is out of this world. Don't be scared of what you hear and read about being full of people...there is pool enough for everyone. The staff in the pool are so nice...out of their way to make you happy. Food cost is regular..7€ for a club sandwich with soft drink. Try the breakfast @ Spago by Wolfgang Puck...the eggs benedict are to die for! The reception staff are really nice too...  For the check out, no need to go to line. Just do the express check out and the bill will be…",5,
"Just a short stay in Singapore so decided top class all the way. The wow factor starts when you enter the towering reception area. Teemimg will people checking in and out the staff quickly and efficently processed our checkin. Interestingly we were asked if we would be using the minibar. We advised no and were informed that a credit card imprint would not be necessary as the bar  would be locked electronically.  Should we change our mind we just had to contact reception and the bar would be released. Jenny was assigned to guide us to our room on the 20th floor of tower 2. This service was appreciated as the size of the hotel is vast.  The room was fantastic, spacious , beautiful fitout ,ample wardrobe space and a bathroom big enough for two wash basins side by side ,shower and…",5,
"Stayed for 5 nights in MBS back in July. Yes the building is stunning and the pool is great, but as a hotel, I don't rate it at all. You're just a number rather than a guest.   My flight arrived early on a Saturday morning, anticipating jet lag I made sure I booked the Friday night so my family and I could go straight to our room to refresh. I called in advance to notify MBS of this and was assured that was fine and there would be no problem. How wrong I was.   Arrived on the Saturday morning to be told my family and I couldn't check in until 3pm at the earliest. After much explaining and checking and more explaining the front desk staff finally understood the situation but told us there wasn't a room ready.   Even though I'd called ahead 2 days in advance to notify them and…",2,
"I was extremely dissatisfied with my experience at the Marina Bay Sands, the So called 'Icon of Singapore'. We checked in just for 1 night, used the infinity pool for 30 mins where one can not swim but just click pictures. It's extremely over crowded. On the day of checkout, we faced the most rude behaviour from the Staff. ""The only thing good was the buffet breakfast with a huge variety and the room quality"". We had requested 1 month prior to booking regarding extended checkout since I was travelling with an Infant. They rather asked us to checkout by 12pm. Worst was they automatically deactivated the Keycard for the Skypark and Observation Deck entry. On requesting for a temporary keycard, so we could just access the same for 15-30 mins to click pictures, the staff asked us to…",3,
"Went to the Marina Bay Sands rooftop bar for drinks on our last evening in Singapore. Entry to the bar is free but you do have to be drinking or eating to be up there (there are hostesses going around to make sure). Note that the level below, with the extended viewing platform, requires a ticket to visit.  Up at the bar, the atmosphere is very cool. The drinks are expensive, even by Singapore standards. However, the main attraction of the bar is the view which is simply spectacular. The best advice I can attach to this is to get up there in the early evening to see the lights during the day, see the sunset and then see the city lights. It is unforgettable.",5,
"I spent only one night here.   Pros : - The location is perfect. - The bed is comfort - They have roof top swimming pool was gorgeous!. - Wifi super fast. - Bathroom with super comfy bathtub  Cont : - The hotel was really busy so sometime they room service or receptionist are to service us quickly.. - The shower room and bathtub is not separated, so we should take shower on the bathtub. quite weird, but still okay.  Overall, the service given were good. quality is very good. Very good view especially at night. Enjoy!",5,
"I had booked MBS after a good research and was not at all disappointed.  Advantages -  - The best way to get a good deal is u should book directly from the marinabaysands official website as u can get a very good deal . - The infinity pool is just mindblowing,  it has an exclusive access for only guests staying in the hotel , remember to carry the pool access card with u for entry bcoz if u forget it in ur room u wiol again have to go fetch it .  - They serve u snacks n booze at the poolside at a slightly higher rate.  - The mrt can be taken to reach the hotel from the airport its fast and efficient.  - The check in is very smooth and the rooms are very cosy and if u like the sea view den request for the garden facing and if u like the city view den request while check in . - It…",5,
"Marina Bay Sands has a very unique architectural style, with the hotel comprising three towers and a giant swimming pool / spa / bar / restaurant area across the top of all three.  The sky bar and pool area affords absolutely amazing (and romantic) views of the city, especially at night. Apart from the top floor, the rest of the hotel is good but not outstanding.  I would recommend it for the experience once, but I think you could get better value at one of the other premium hotels if you visit regularly.",4,
"It was great,  we had a fantastic room and great view   The rooms were very generous too You really don't have to leave if you just want to relax by the pool and eat at one of the many restaurants in the hotel, but it isn't much of a walk to see the gardens or to go shopping  The staff are great and it has everything you will ever need  It is a must stay, even if it's only for a few days  Be warned don't stay here at the beginning of your trip as everything else will seem less appealing ",5,
"Our first stop in our 3 week honeymoon was this beautiful hotel in Singapur. We were positively impressed by its great location and its out-of-this-world design. However, as with any other large hotel in a fantastic city, the never ending crowds made breakfast and dining loud, as well as swimming and rooftop bar rather impersonal, which is not what you are looking for if wanting to spend some quality time with the love of your life.   The pool offers a stunning view, but sharing it with 100+ guests kills it for me.   Staff was charmingly helpful in changing our room and even upgrading it after we initially received one with an intoxicating smoke smell. ",4,
"Well, the design is great, even I saw better ones in SIngapore. We had some of the cheapest rooms probably. View on the garden, but we ve been satisfied. There  is a shuttle from airport to the hotel and a brigde leading you to the gardens by the bay.  The pool is of course pretty cool, but of course pretty crowded. There is even a pool for children! But whats really annoying: A lot of people, mainly asians feel free to make pictures and video and they dont care if you are on the video or not. Well, in case you like your privacy, maybe not the best.  The room is nice, clean and served with TWG Tea Bags.  There ve been just one strange thing: We came in the early morning and our room was not ready yet, so they send us to a ""waiting room"" It was like a normal hotelroom but very…",3,
"What a fantastic place to stay. My wife and I, we're truly amazed by wonderful views Marina Bay Sands has to offer. The infinity pool is a must if you visit Singapore, however I'm a bit of an OCD freak. So as you can imagine cleanliness for me has to be beyond immaculate. However we throughly enjoyed our stay. P.s, try the in room dinning. The fish and chips is absolutely brilliant.",5,
"I had a wonderful time in Marina bay sands, i loved everything room, city view from the highest top, staff, atmosphere, the infinity pool and food all were amazing.. planning to visit more places inside this huge complex..",5,
"My kids wanted to stay here because of the surf board swimming pool.  The architecture is amazing, both inside and out.  We had a wonderful guy at check in who upgraded our room and asked a concierge to walk us to Tower 3 which was across the complex. We had a view of the Garden by the Bay with the light show at night and a view of the Art & Science museum.  The infinity pool is gorgeous at all times of the day but it was always crowded from morning to night.  The hotel is a major tourist destination and sometimes felt a little like an airport because there are so many people.  I am glad they are doing so well but it does detract from a luxury experience.  My mother also slipped in the large marble shower and that was very scary.  She's quite elderly and she could have easily…",3,
I dont know way anyone would stay anywhere else in Singapore. This hotel offers everything. The pool is unbelievable and the views are stunning. Great bars and attractions. Hop on and off bus stop is a step from the hotel.,5,
"Marina Bay Sands is wonderful hotel, 5 star hotel worth it.I stayed there fo 3 night and 3 days.well not as cheap as other hotel but worth it.I do recommended to family and friends. service was excellent and food.the pool on the top of the building was awesome. and ,and also the bar and clucb at night are excelent.",5,
"Marina Bay is amazing, not just the hotel but the whole complex is integrated very well. Had an incredible view in a city view room, that was very spacious and clean but spent most of our time up at the infinity pool. The service was amazing considering how busy it was, and the pool itself incredible. There are also great views of the Gardens by the Bay.  The pool was divided well into areas kids could swim and then a seperate third for adults only which was far less crowded and great for photos.  Had a very quick check in and check out process including storing our bags before we checked in and after with incredible ease. Would love to stay here again!",5,
"The hotel is really large, probably too large for my personal liking. But that's just my opinion. Check in was a long process however personnel was extremely polite and apologised for a long wait. The room had no electricity and it took many hours before someone qualified (electrician?) came to fix the problem which was obviously minor but the wait was far too long. Service was impersonal but very efficient and polite. The location is good for visiting attractions around Marina Bay, a bit far if you want to walk to ethnic precincts (Little India or Kampong Glam).",3,
"This hotel is a total joke!!!! We paid SGD 700+++ to stay at this hotel for one night because we wanted to enjoy the pool, but upon check out they did not allow us to go back into the pool!!! How absurd!! Noooooo hotel in the world does that!! We have visited hotels in all major cities in the world and we have always been able to use the pool after check out. It's totally absurd that they do this. I will not be coming back if they don't change this policy and I advice everybody to do the same! NOT worth it!!",1,
"We stayed at room no 4602 from 10th to 11th August. Loved the moment when we opened the room door and the curtains automatically drew open, revealing the city view that I asked for.   All the staff were friendly, from the bellboy to the guy who helped us to get a cab after we checked out.  Room was spacious and clean. Our little one had a great time roaming around the room.   We had previously stayed at another local hotel (with very small rooms but for the same size budget) for 13 nights and this room was such a relief for us and our little one. I also booked it as a surprise for my husband who has this on his bucket list.  Basic stuff such as toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel), kettle and hairdryer are provided.   Buffet breakfast at Rice was lovely. Do take note…",5,
"Aside from the too long check in time and crowded lobby (which is understandable) the hotel is really just so-so, considering its enormous construction budget and resources available to the Parent Co. The room design, quality of furnishings, general service level all perhaps up to par, but no more than that. ",3,
"Stayed here for a staycation in May 2016. The hotel is very crowded! First, there is a long queue at check-in. They do try to speed up the process but it still takes some time.   The room itself is quite spacious and nice. Gym is good --- there are quite a number of equipments so that it doesn't feel too packed even when there are many people on a Saturday morning. The swimming pool, however, is very packed. Not an enjoyable experience at all. The infinity pool is supposed to be one of the highlight, however, with that many people it doesn't feel so nice.  Net, for a weekend staycation, especially with families, Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa is a better alternative. However, for partying with friends, and for tourists who want to experience Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is still one of…",3,
"Seems difficult to fulfill all expectations from a hotel this size, but this team is awesome and makes all dreams come true. Stayed in familyroom, was a good choice as very spacious and satisfied all needs. Swimming pool is awesome and prices of food/drinks there is ok. Offered free fresh up in gym after long day before traveling, wasn't expected. This is just one of the best experiences ever. ",5,
Wonderful hotel great hotel had booked a club room and must say it was great   Great stay great food and best hospitality  Has room on 54th floor  Great pool through was not that clean which we were expecting and you can easily see that in day time  Must stay for 03 nights to get the best feel ,5,
"Marina Bay Sands is just one of those experiences you must have and you really need two nights to fully enjoy the facilities.  Our room was city-side (worth the little extra) and we were kindly upgraded to the 47th floor. The rooms are huge-our 2yo was able to sleep on the very comfy sofa bed and we also had a king size bed. The rooms are beautifully appointed.  We booked a bed and breakfast package, and while most people seem to head to the ground floor restaurants, the package includes Spago on the 57th floor. This is a fabulous way to start the day-delicious food, amazing views and exceptional service.  The Infinity Pool is an experience in itself-with poolside service of food and drinks (that are reasonably priced as well), it's very easy to spend a relaxing day poolside,…",5,
"stayed there on 2 occasions, last it was between 10-12 june 2016. as usual the giant three towers have become singapore landmark. skypark was too too good.. infinity pool is bit crowded though.. still enjoyable and memorable rooms are good, i was on floor 6 facing city... night view is excellent.  overall good experience",5,
"We stayed in the Marina Bay Sands during our short visit. It is at the bay front with 3 cascading towers and an iconic Sky Park connecting them.Spectacular indeed. It was built to impress..  The Marina Bay Sands  has a lotus inspired ArtScience Museum ,award winning restaurants, beautiful outdoor gardens , exclusive branded shops , theatres , Vegas casino and the Infinity Pool.  Overlooking the elegant skyline , the Marina Bay Sands is a modern day Singapore .The reflections of its global relevance are seen everywhere .The  ethnicities of visitors, and service persons , international food varieties and world class facilities .It is a remarkable transformation of the Lion City.",5,
"We had 3 nights in an Orchid Suite  room in July 2016.  The hotel is huge and modern and achieves the wow factor.  I'd put it on a par with the Shard in London for views and glitz.  The room was enormous (97 sq m) Room 5202 in Tower 3.  There were 2 banks of windows overlooking the city and just about everything you could dream of.  Fantastic bed, bathroom and sitting area.  The room was very quiet - no noise from other rooms, even in the bathroom.  The bathroom is enormous with a huge bath and shower and nice shampoos etc.  (But no razor - minor quibble.)  Staff are helpful although the lobby can get very crowded so self checkout was good.  There aren't many shops in the hotel lobby but Singapore is full of shops so no problems there.  The Marina Bay Shoppes is right over the…",5,
"This hotel is breathtaking from the minute you walk into the lobby. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The infinity pool on the 57th floor overlooks the city and is absolutely beautiful. The hotel also has a lot to offer.. a casino, a hotel, a food court, etc. My friends and I had a wonderful stay!!",5,
We stayed at MBS on 7th aug with a group of friends. It turned out to be the best vacation ever which we had. The property is super amazing. I stayed at 36th floor with an enchanting view of the gardens by the bay. The best part is the infinity pool which is an out of the world experience. It was like a heavenly experience. The jacuzzis were superb. The casino and the shopping mall was again an attraction. Overall it was a remarkable stay and our best vacation.,5,
"I really loved my stay in Marina Bay Sands. The staff was great and the room was even better than I expected. As with any big hotel, expect lines at the check-in or check-out and budget some extra time.",5,
"the infinity pool was packed with people, even at 6.30 am there was already some guests.  we booked the bay suite 47th floor and it comes with butler service. for 1 night for 4 people $2700++  they have no halal food option. at least not that we know off.  the room and bathroom was good. view of Garden by The Bay was awesome.",3,
"A lot of people say it's all about the pool.  Well, the pool is amazing, and they work really hard to keep it open to guests only, and they have now created an area that's ""no kids"".  And the Spago breakfast buffet up there is amazing.  But, really, the whole entire place is unbelievable.  Either side is amazing.  Everything you could ever want to do in Singapore is right there.  It's just perfect.    Now...not everything about my stay was perfect.  First of all, I was not happy with the photos on line of my room vs. what I received.  I had specifically asked for a king bed and got two double beds.  I was mad.  Then they came and pushed the beds together as if that was supposed to fix it.  Then they promised to switch to an upgraded room for the last two nights of the week-long…",5,
"We had a wonderful stay at Marina Bays Sands hotel. The hotel building is iconic. The location is excellent. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is an amazing experience. Overall, this hotel is a must try. I must mention how impressed we were with the operations and logistics given the number of occupants at the hotel. A special thank you to Mr. Skye and Ms. Mindy for the warm welcome upon our arrival. And also a special thanks to the person who kept our room clean during our stay.",5,
"There's only one thing I didn't like in this hotel so I'll mention it first, it is more crowded than I would like, but who can blame them. Marina Bay Sands is an icon and deserves to be it has everything you would expect from a top hotel plus more, the pool is a must see(it was the deciding factor for me) the hotel was on my bucket list for quite awhile and finally stayed in it, I have to say that it's one of my favorite hotels worldwide. The views from this hotel are incredible and even though it's crowded you will only feel it in the lobby, the check in and check out was swift and the staff were great. A special mention goes to Dax the pool manager he was friendly and great and made sure that my time spent in the pool was an experience in itself.",4,
We decided to stay one night in the MBS as we wanted to go to the infinity pool on the roof top. The Facilities are outstanding and it is the best place to be. If you stay longer go and try the casino and the street food market in the basement in the attched shopping area.,5,
"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay sands on the 7th floor of tower 3 it was very nice with a view over gardens by the bay and we also had access to the horizon pool on the 57th floor which was amazing. There is a hot spa as well up there and the views are spectacular. There are 2000 rooms in the 3 towers and they have 10000 staff in the company, it runs like a well oiled machine but personal service lacks in some instances especially if very busy in all areas. that is probably the only reason why I didn't give it an excellent rating. There is room for improvement.",4,
"Stayed there with my family for 2 nights, the room was ok, pool was good but lots of tour group walking through. Upon checkout,  we decided to go to the restaurant at the pool for lunch. Knowing the strict policy entering the pool area we check with the receptionist if we will be able to go up to the restaurant without the pass and he reassure us that is not a problem. We made our way up through tower 1 to realise that it only brings us to sky57 and not Spago. The  staff name KHIR RAMLI, at the security gate said we need to go back down and walk all the way to tower 2 and then back up to 57 floor again.  All this trouble just because we just checkout, so we explain to the staff if he can let us through and if he is worried that we might use the pool he can escort us to the…",1,
Stayed for one night Checking into this hotel is a nightmare. Queues are huge and you can only hope you are in correct one for the tower your accommodation is booked for or you'll need to start again.  The rooms are grand with views from our room breathtaking. Trying to find a seat near or around pool is also a nightmare. Took us almost an hour waiting to find a seat. There should be a limit to people sitting all day by the pool so others can get an opportunity.  Nighttime from pool areas and bars on this level are spectacular.   If you have the patience certainly worth the experience ,5,
"This hotel have three towers with an infinity pool overlooking the singapore skyline in the top floor. What makes the hotel special is the infinity pool, which has the amazing view of Singapore. The room and the bathroom of this hotel was clean and spacious and the amenities was very good .We recommend the city view room, so you could enjoy the view of singapore",5,
"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Amazing doesn't even come close. The hotel is out of this world.  We took a cab from Changi Airport and thought Singapore looked amazing. When we were several kilometres away from the hotel something caught our eyes. 3 X massive towers with what can only be described as a spaceship looking structure in its roof,covered the horizon. It was The Marina Bay Sands.  Check in was surprisingly easy and our bags arrived to our room before we did. We got the family suite which was huge. With 1 X king size bed and 2 X King singles. Although you don't get a view from these rooms.  The whole reason we stayed at the hotel was to experience the infinity pool situated on the roof. It didn't let us down. No pictures can…",4,
"After a 13 hour flight from London, check in was quite stressful, we waited in a queue for about 45 minutes to check in and this isn't what we expected having paid to stay in one of the most exclusive resorts in Singapore. We were then told they only had one twin room left on the lowest floor in the hotel. We then had to walk around 10 minutes to our room (the resort is huge and you have to constantly change between towers to get to the pool, spa, gym and restaurants, it is a far distance between each). We then got to our room and our room key wouldn't work, after a second trip to reception we were informed we had been given the wrong room number and we were the room next door, we then started the journey back to our room.   The room was large, modern, clean and very inviting.…",4,

By the way, we’re tourists from China. On that day, after we visited Gardens By The Bay. We wanted to take MRT to turn back our hotel--The Bay Hotel at Bayfront Station. And on the way to Bayfront Station, we lost contact with our children. Because the children walked so fast, and we adults couldn’t follow them. Then at Bayfront we waited and waited, we looked for and looked for. We couldn’t find them yet. At last, an old man--a gentleman gave us an advice. He advised us to ask for help to the police. Soon after, maybe 15 minutes later, we saw our children again. At that time, we and our babies had…",5,
"What I love most about MBS is the exceptional service they give to their customers! From room service to concierge assistance to efficiency of check-in and check-out, they know how to treat their customers well. Even when you call the operator, they address you by your name, which makes it more personal.   Rooms are average-sized, beds are comfortable and you have a clean, modern interior. Room design varies. Nothing exceptional about the room, but I do love the TWG tea they provide. Plus you get free access to the pool and top deck and get the best view of Singapore.",4,
My Mans's biz trip and I was lucky enough to go. What a place. The infinity pool from the 57th floor was so nice.  View of all of the City from a rooftop pool!  Top notch restaurants like spago are there too  Service was good especially considering how many rooms/ people there. Stay here!!,5,
"Recently stayed in an orchid suite, city view of Marina Bay Sands hotel. Overall great experience. Big and busy hotel in the area. The room was surprisingly quiet and tranquil (my room was in level 24). Amazing city and bay view from the bed. Club 55 breakfast food is yummy and too many to choose from. It again has a nice view too. I love the gym which is also in tower 2, level 55; next door to Club 55. The only thing with the gym is not 24 hours, runs 5 am to I think 10 pm. There are a lot of other things this hotel can offer if you have time and the location is prime. Staffs are good too. Definitely will come back again when visiting  Singapore but probably will book for a regular room instead of suite due to significantly higher rate but suspect not too different  facilities. ",5,
Rooms are clean. Housekeeping do an excellent job.great view from the pool but thats where it stops.....16 dollars for a glass of beer at the bar. Tour groups walking through the pool areas staring. Security was not visible when the night clubs were open. many slip hazards where people would not dry off after using the pool going straight into the lifts which i observed a few guests slip over.in essense would i stay here again..not sure. I felt at times I  was staying in a theme park.credit must be given to the housekeeping staff which I could not fault.,2,
"This has to be on every able person's bucket list. The entire experience of the stay is amazing. The service staff, the room, the views, infinity pool, the pub... everything is just top notch. Must go here.",5,
"Great place especially if you are having a special occasion. Everything you need is in the hotel (casino, shopping, great landmarks and great views) and it has great connectivity to rest of the city. The Kudeta restaurant has the best food I ever had",5,
Requested for a room with bayside view and clearly was not disappointed. The view from the infinty pool is even more marvelous and unlike any worldwide. Great view of the city's skyline and gives great perspective of the many high rise buildings in the little red dot. Highly recommend to use the infinity pool in the morning where it is less packed and more suited to take in the sights before having breakfast at Sky on 57 by Justin Quek.,5,
"This is an incredible outdoor dining experience, on top of one of the most extravagant buildings in the world.  My (now husband) was kicking himself he hasn't got a ring on hand as it is the perfect place to propose!  The staff were so friendly and the food delicious, be prepared for higher price",5,
"We stayed here for one night to celebrate my birthday with some family members and friends. We stayed at the Sands Suite, and got checked in at around 1:30 pm. The butlers came to take us and our luggage to the room on 48th floor. Upon checking in, they gave a short room tour / briefing and I was really surprised to see the headboard of the bed decorated with a Happy Birthday sign! And the suite itself was very spacious and clean and WE HAD A FREAKING POOL TABLE(!!!), definitely the best hotel room I've ever seen. For the birthday celebration, they allowed us to decorate the place, and even provided us with an extra table for the dessert table. They also helped us move the furniture. Some time later, they came in bringing a chocolate birthday cake and sang happy birthday for me!…",5,
"All you need for your relaxing stay, business trip and so on are in here, Awesome Building Structure, all in one, truly magnificent, a must visit in Singapore, has many choices to choose from,  clothes,  foods etc.",5,
"What is not to like when it comes to cheese and chocolate. Great selection of cheese, breads and deserts. Fantastic view over looking the Bay.  Went with teenage boys who loved it. Really enjoyed it here",5,
I stayed at the MBS for 2 nights in July for work. It is a huge complex without a huge deal of character but provides everything required as a hotel of this level should be expected to do.   The infinty bar in the roof top is fanstatic whilst the views are pretty stunning especially in the evening & at night.   It's expensive and I would struggle to justify spending the rates charged if it was a personal trip but as this was part of a group company function it was an ideal setting.  ,4,
"My husband and I stayed at the MBS for a night in Singapore as he had gone there for a conference and I had accompanied him.  First things first - the majestic, super awesome, splendid infinity pool on the 57th floor of the hotel - is something to die for. I don't think it's overrated in any aspect because as one stands at the edge of the pool, you'll know that this moment is probably what the high rooms rates are about. It's an amazing experience and words cannot describe the top of the world feeling you get. The best time to visit the pool is in the afternoon between 1 and 3 p.m. as at that time, the pool is least crowded.   About the hotel - there are 3 towers - and thousands of rooms so an insane number of guests. But they have made good arrangements for check in and check…",4,
"We arrived here midday to check-in which took around 15 minutes at the desk. Our room view was for the gardens by the bay rather then the city view which we realized later on wasnt much of a problem as we were always looking over the city anyway.  The room was large and comfortable, and the service was actually quite attentive considering the size of the hotel.   This hotel is also connected with a large shopping mall and a casino and also has entrances to the gardens by the bay, so sometimes it can seem like you are in a shopping mall rather then a hotel.  I was absolutely blown over by the inifinity pool, and this is the reason why it makes this hotel such a special place. Me and my wife just couldn't get over the view it provided from there and the pool was my favorite place.…",5,
This is an incredible place and view. We've been here back in 2013 for the first time and of course visited here and celebrated my sis' bday party on 57th floor. We couldn't imagine any other place for celebrating. Was really nice and we enjoyed too much.,5,
"Beautiful place, the infinity pool is incredible, a must do once in a lifetime, the views by day by night are incredible. It is crowded but you will find a spot and if you know how to take the best photos, you can make it look like you are all alone in the pool. Check in was incredibly efficient despite the large amount of people, we asked for a room in the upper floors and were given one on the 50th floor. We opened the door and here is the wow part: the view was just breath-taking. On to the ouch part of the review now: it is not cheap - but - it is worth every penny once you get in your swim suit and contemplate the Lion City's skyline....",5,
"Of course this being the most popular hotel in Singapore you overpay for what you get. Rooms are spacious and clean yes, killer views of the city yes, but it's still not worth 400€/night.  The position is perfect to visit the gardens by the bay (especially the supertrees grove late at night) and the Bay area in general, very nice skyline views at night both from the top and from downstairs.  Downside is that you have to queue for 30 min to check in (not ok when you pay this kind of price for a room) plus checkin is at 3pm and checkout at 11am, what the hell?  Pool is nice but a bit overcrowded and FULL of children and loud/rude tourists taking selfies...   I'm not gonna come back the next time in Singapore...",3,
"Room was huge, clean and neat. But shower is a disaster as temperature regulators are out of control.  All the common areas are overcrowded. Pool view is breathtaking. But again it's overcrowded with so many people with selfi sticks and taking pictures rather than enjoying the pool. Finding a pool side chair is nearly impossible. Room service is quick and staff is friendly. But food in hotel is overpriced. Good shopping mall downstairs with lots of branded shops and a big food court with a huge variety of food which is great value for money. Had to wait in the queue for about 10 mins to get a table for breakfast buffet. But worth it as breakfast buffet is huge with so many varieties of food. Beautiful hotel. Nice to have one experience. But will not come again ",4,
"What a place. What a view. It is hard to put into words how amazingly sublime this place is. Everything has been thought of, implemented and executed perfectly. The pool is incredible, clean and plenty of room. The staff attending the pool are organised and pleasant. The view from both sides of the Skypark are absolutely incredible; if anyone tells you different either remove them from your life or walk away. The views are literally breathtaking. The rooms are large and furnished excellently. Excelent shower & bathroom; bed and most impressive is the view from the room. You can gaze out of your room for hours in awe of this beautiful almost SciFi city. The food is incredible, not over priced. I was in Singapore for 3 days and i could of happily spent 3 days just in his hotel and…",5,
We just stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights and my only regret is that we didn't have more time there! We upgraded to an Orchid suite and it was well worth the money! The room was absolutely spectacular with everything you could possibly want. We had a city view and it was absolutely breathtaking! The infinity pool of course is the biggest draw for this hotel and it did not disappoint. One thing I wish I knew before is that the pool is busy during the day but night time is when it gets SUPER busy! It was easy getting pictures during the day up there but much more challenging at night. Because we had a suite we had the option to eat at Adrift for breakfast or club 55...club 55 breakfast is included with any room at the hotel and it is much better than the Adrift breakfast. I…,5,
"Spent here only one night but definitely worth the money I spent. Fabulous room at the 48th floor in tower 3 overlooking the bay. Loved the pool at night and the beautiful city skyline! Friendly and helpful staff, excellent service. Highly recommended once in a life experience ;) ",5,
"Spacious room and great infinite pool. Great location as all the premium retail stores and casino just within walking distance. However, there's not much exclusivity about this hotel anymore I guess. It is quite overcrowded. Overall, for short stay, this is definitely a fabulous hotel for luxurious experience.",4,
The bar is great but you don't need to take an expansive night there. Unless you are willing to drop a few hundreds just to get a pics at the infinity pool with the crowd of tourists and their selfie stick.,2,
"My friends and I visited back in September when there was that awful Southeast Asian haze. Absolutely beautiful hotel with phenomenal views, but because of the smog, we unfortunately didn't get to enjoy any of the panoramic views. What a bummer BUT we got upgraded from a Deluxe Room to an Orchid Suite free of charge. That said, fantastic hotel service and friendly staff. Gorgeous infinity pool and great complimentary breakfast. The hotel is steps to the MRT/subway and has easy access to Gardens by the Bay. And because Marina Bay Sands is an integrated resort, guests have a wide range of activities ranging from luxury shopping to casino fun and even afternoon tea and fine dining. Will definitely come back again!",5,
"This hotel is famous for its pool and unfortunately they think that will save them. The room was ok, the pool area is fantastic, the pool restaurants are ok but the staff is not vey friendly. Seems like they been tricked a number of times and are suspicious of everything. We could have accepted that if the rest had been good but the service level in general is average, the prices are not. The hotel breakfast was really, really bad. They have to shape up! They cannot only live on the beautiful rooftop pool. ",3,
"This is not the cheapest option for a hotel stay by Singapore or anywhere standards but we were on honeymoon. For an extra few hundred pounds we decided to splash out. The rooms are pretty big and nice. Not as special as you might expect for the price and style of the hotel but very nice nonetheless. Hence 4 not 5 rating. You get access with your room key to the viewing platform which is cool. Also breakfast was included and we had it once in the restaurant in the middle of the rooftop which was very nice. The hotel is right above a shopping centre and there is a metro station right there. A walk around the marina is nice. Is really well located for the Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer and the Marina. The light show is worth a watch. But, the pool, which is why you…",4,
"Had a lovely 5 night stay at MBS. The brand definitely holds a golden ribbon. The main reason we chose MBS was for the infinity pool, it really was as incredible as we expected but it was always extremely busy. We were relieved that there was an adult area but even that was sometimes overcrowded.   Breakfast buffet was extensive and the rooms and bathrooms were spacious and well equipped but a little dated. The foyer and staff have the feel of a busy airport terminal with no personal touch.   Great shops and cafes at walking difference.  A room on a higher floor definitely makes a difference.",4,
"Upon arrival we were lucky enough to upgraded to a suite which was the best way to start our stay. I believe it was the smallest type of suite in the hotel but it was absolutely massive. The suite was very well fitted out. It felt very modern and undoubtedly 5 star, I wish I could live in it permanently. Obviously the standout draw for the hotel is the rooftop infinity pool, this too was amazing. It is way overcrowded in the evening which ruins the experience. The best time is to get up to the pool before sunrise and there should only be a handful of people making it a much more enjoyable experience. Needless to say, but the views of the city from the pool are breathtaking.",5,
"I've stayed at the MBS Atleast for 6 times between 2012 - 2015, mostly with friends and couple of times with family.  They have a state of art facility, you can easily spend your day in and around the hotel itself, located in an excellent location. From the infinity pool you have see the entire Singapore (skyline) infront of you, it's a priceless experience.   Service at the hotel is good, check in usually takes time, rooms are big and spacious. You can't miss the breakfast buffet, lip smacking.   Casino being one of the major visited and in demand, they even have a mall connected with the hotel which has a theatre for live performing shows, water laser light show which is complimentary for all, most of the brands which you can think off is available at the mall.    Do visit the…",4,
"Instead of paying to go to observation deck, go to the bar on top!  The drinks are expensive but you get a great of the city, and pool.  Well worth the price of a cocktail!  The restaurant is over priced and we left hungry but if your looking for a romantic dinner this may be your spot.",4,
"We have just come from a holiday in Indonesia and are now staying in Marina Bay Sands on our way back to Europe. Our intention was to spend the day with our kids at the rooftop pool. Great idea... but we have to leave the pool at 1pm (after long discussions; normally it is 11am). And the only reason to stay at this hotel is the pool.....rip off!!  The building - for sure - is impressive, but the hotel itself is completely overcrowded and nothing special. The rooms are okay, but you can find much nicer rooms in this hotel category. Staff at the pool is nice, staff at reception is incompetent. They smile, but that's all.   In total: never again!! Even if the pool is cool, remember you can only use it until 11 am. And it is even more overcrowded than the hotel. It is no problem to…",2,
"It's expensive, but the pool is not to be missed.  The rooms are comfortable.  The view from the pool is amazing, if you can stand the crowd.  Kids love it.  Have a meal from the roof top, it's not to be missed!",5,
"we stayed in a suite for 1 night as a stopover/novelty/out of curiosity.2 adults and 2 young kids.  pro's: the shopping underneath the building is extenisive to say the least. good restaurants(bread street kitchen by gordon ramsay) et al. the laser show at night on the water was good to watch for the kids. The best thing was the food court at the airport end of the shopping area downstairs - fantastic variety of food which was very cheap.  Cons: the place is constantly heaving with people, everywhere you go. In the restaurants. in the pool. In the lifts. In the shops and surrounding areas.   The staff are robotic and didn't seem that interested in doing anything more than they had to keep the crowds moving. Check in was a drag, even having a suite with a special check in area…",3,
"The Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel, and the pool is definitely all it's hyped up to be, we spent an entire day there (it's best to go in before the sun sets, and stay up until it gets dark!).  The staff was very friendly, and we even got an upgrade to one of the best suites on the top floor, free of charge!   Another huge plus is the fact that it is right next to the gorgeous Gardens by the Bay, and is attached to a great shopping mall (which has every store imaginable!), outside of which there are nightly fountain shows.  Generally, there is nothing to complain about, and if you are visiting Singapore, I would strongly recommend choosing Marina Bay Sands, even if it means spending a little extra. It really is a special place!",5,
This hotel is absolutely spectacular. I had the privilege of staying one night during my visit to Singapore. The rooms are spacious and the views are beautiful. The rooftop is the best part. It's the reason why I booked the night. You can only go to the pool if you are staying on the property. I envisioned myself having mimosas on a Sunday and that is exactly what I did. ,4,
"If you know the Marina Bay Sands, then you will know about the infininty pool on the 57th floor - simply amazing.  Beside that, the hotel is very well appointed but so huge that the reception area is like a train station.  We had a family room on the second level, which was huge and great for sperading out and relaxing.  There's lots of great things to do in the vicinity, you can visit the shopping mall with a great Asian food court without leaving the hotel, or venture further out to the bay gardens, Chinatown or go on a Duck Tour - all highly recommended.",5,
"we stayed june 15-19 premier garden view room, we booked 5 room there .  first i must say its a very big hotel  some of the services are really good like express check out with out delay, you can see you daily bills summery on you TV screen . but some of the things we dont like. if you ask to open you mini bar they charge from you  empty you MINI bar , they gives only 2    500 ML water bottle during a day. if you ask for Cutlery after some limits they charge in your rooms.  Pool is good with nice view  you feel great,  but you cant access with out a card .!!  Overall hotel is good only for one night experience.",3,
"As the prices are very high we've decided to spend only one night out four in the Marina Bay Sands. It was absolutely worth it.  The infinity pool on the top of the very nice building is just amazing (The pool can only be accessed with a room card! No room no pool access). From there you have a direct view on the skyline of Singapore. Brilliant!  It was a bit hectic at the huge lobby entrance but the service personnel was always nice, friendly and helpful.",4,
If you want a great view of Singapore then this is a must do.  Taxi driver had told us that the price of entry to the observation deck also included a swim in the roof top pool but this is not the case so our initial expectations were not met. Nevertheless the views are breathtaking and we enjoyed the visit. Price was reasonable. Building is an amazing price of architecture.  Accommodation and shopping is most definitely for those with a larger budget.,4,
As an ex swimmer when we decided on a stopover in Singapore there was only one hotel to choose.  Most amazing views. Room was spacious.   Swimming pool was amazing. I could not believe how busy the pool was at 10.30pm.   Loved my stay.   Checking in and checking out slightly disappointing as we were entitled to the priority queue which was slower than normal queue.   Most amazing hotel. ,5,
Stunning architecture. I really enjoyed our stay in this hotel and the highlight was the roof top infinity pool. The bad side of this hotel is that it's very crowded and you feel like you are more at festival with a lot of people than staying  in a hotel. ,4,
We were upgraded to a suite as check in was delayed - excellent customer service! The rooms are utterly beautiful! The club room package includes afternoon tea and canapés with drinks. We definitely got our monies worth! You need your keycard to access the pool. Expensive but thoroughly worth every cent!!,5,
"We only had a night to spend at MBS, and the reason why we went to MBS, was mainly for the infinity pool. We had the premier room with 2 double beds. The room was very spacious, clean, new and modern. Going to the infinity pool, they have strict security imposed on their gates, which is good, as that reduces large non-hotel guests crowds at the pool. The view of the city from the pool was amazing. The hotel itself has a casino, MRT station and shopping all downstairs. I would definitely come back for this experience again!",5,
"Had a few nights stay in a double bay view suite.  Nice room, great views.  Pool is spectacular, very, very busy. Hotel is too big to have any holiday/city break atmosphere.  It is commercial. Would stay again if in Singapore as the views are with it.",4,
"Lunch was fabulous, great selection on Menu, beautifully presented, perfectly cooked, wonderful attentive staff, reasonably priced and the views are magnificent. Surrounding area is beautiful and well worth a visit too.  I would definitely recommend it.  ",5,
"The room here was great. The staff were really accommodating and met our room requests. The pool is spectacular... Amazing views and open 6am-11pm so plenty of time to relax up on the boat!  Easy access to the garden by the bay, which is amazing. And you can see the light show from he hotel!  Prices are high in the hotel - but that's probably expected when going there! ",5,
What a beautiful trip here to Marina bay sands.  Hotel reception and entry is more of a shopping centre feeling... totally buzzing atmosphere.  Rooms are spacious and contemporary.  Food is great and a wide choice to dine from.  Rooftop pool is by far the very best!!  Brillant hotel and exceeds all expectations. Definitely will return.,5,
"Cozy living and staying here, very good services in every corner of this hotel. The best hotel with full concierge Les Clefs d'Or service so I can have enormous experiences during my staying period.  Surely I will be back with bigger group of my Family. Good view, Good People with great maintenance.  Keep it up!  Cheers!!!  Dedy Mahendra",5,
"We loved our stay at Marina Bay Sand. The highlight was the pool, which is incredible. We went at 6am and was empty, was beautiful to see the sun rising over the water.     Singapore is a beautiful city, with many great hotels. MBS is not a hotel you go to for opulence or service, it's the experience of the hotel and pool and attached shopping centre. It's got an impersonal feel, especially in the lobby, but it's still an experience not to be missed",4,
"I chose this hotel for a staycation for my birthday, it was expensive but I wanted a treat. We checked in early around 2pm (hotel stipulated check-in time is 3pm). I've read reviews of slow and long queues during check in but luckily we did not experience that. Check-in was efficient, the receptionist was nice enough to give us a room on a higher floor.  Check out was also efficient and pleasant.  Room: We chose a premier room with a view of the city. The room was a good size, bathroom had 2 sinks and a lovely bathtub. It was very clean, and the view from the room was lovely. All amenities as expected of a high class luxury hotel. Bed was very comfortable.   Infinity pool: This is the highlight of the hotel, so we expected it to be crowded. But it was super crowded beyond my…",4,
Well i have stayed 2 times and its one of the best view hotel in Singapore. I was in awe with the way they are operating this huge place. My check in was smooth however it does get very busy . The infinity pool is the place to be .. and the club over there is really awesome its the highest accessible floor at marina bay sands.   Well the best part is everything is like a short walk or cab ride from the place. the staff is realy curteous. Will i go again maybe or not to stay there but definetely to visit .,4,
"We stayed here for a week and it is a beautiful hotel. All the staff is very friendly and helpful. I would always recommend to book a room with club status as you gain access to the lounge 55 where you can have free breakfast, afternoon and evening snacks as well as free drinks. I also highly recommend it because of its prime location near a shopping mall and the Garden by the Bay.",5,
"Really enjoyed this hotel. Stayed in a wonderful city view room on the 47th floor tower 2. Room appointments were 1st class. Sky park infinity pool was a great  experience with amazing views. Would have to be the selfie stick capital of the world!  Down side, expect to pay double $$ the rate of everything at this hotel from room rate, food & beverage. Than you would from most 5 star hotels of similar standard across the world.",4,
Admittedly we only stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for use of the spectacular infinity pool and it lived up to our expectations and more! An adult only section of the pool was definitely a plus and the poolside food was delicious and reasonably priced.  The hotel itself is modern but the rooms could do with a bit of updating to keep up with the lobby and surrounding areas. We were also a bit disappointed that the 'complimentary' water only stretched to 2 bottles per room per night.  But it's definitely worth spending a bit more money to tick this one off the bucket list!,4,
"Traveled to Singapore on a 6 day/night Anniversary break, spent the first 3 at Raffles (separate review already done) and the second 3 (28th-30th June) at Marina Bay Sands, since these are the two most iconic and recognisable hotels there. Having spent 3 nights at Raffles where we could clearly see this hotel during the day and marvel at it lit up at night, we wanted the contrast of staying somewhere new and modern. This hotel certainly is that but by no means in a bad way.   This is an incredibly large hotel complex  and a very busy one also; being in the middle of the school holidays probably more so than normal. When we arrived for check in there were lots of people queuing but I must say there were lots of staff on hand.One of my tips/ recommendations for booking this hotel…",5,
"Many people probably come here for the infamous infinity pool at 57th floor, since it's only available to hotel guests. But the hotel offers a lot more than that. The 57th floor also features the skybar Ce La Vi, with the same amazing view as the pool and open to the public. The adjacent Shoppes is a large shopping mall complex with lots of dining options. The largest light&water show in southeast Asia is shown for free every night.   The bold architecture is worth a visit in itself, it feels like living in a spaceship. Our exclusive club room on 39th floor was very spacious and had an amazing view of the bay area. Arriving is a breeze, since they got their own MRT subway stop under the hotel.  Even though the hotel is great in most aspects, its popularity makes it feel very…",4,
My employer booked me in this hotel and I thought it was very nice but the hotel is way too big. Walking to the reception and then to the room takes quite a long time.  I went to the top floor and tried the infinity pool and it looks superb. A one of a kind experience for me really only at the time I did not have someone to enjoy it with.  This hotel host a lost of trade shows and I think it would be good to stay there if you attended one. Apart from that I would prefer a smaller hotel but that is a personal choice.  The rooms are nothing special for the price but they are still nice.,4,
"After our first night my husband and I recounted all the hotel rooms we have stayed in around the world that could compete with this one! What a place, the staff is amazing everything we asked for they were able to arrange, from early check in to late check out, to an anniversary surprise, restaurant recommendations and booking even the evening after we checked out! Lynda from express service and Izwan from the concierge service really went all out!  Needless to say most of the key attractions and restaurants are linked to the hotel, you really shouldn't stay anywhere else. Only guests can use the pool, you have access to the mall, casino, gardens, and sky deck.  The rooms are beautiful and so clean and spacious. Don't think twice about booking here! ",5,
"At the begging the suite check in was slow. You have a separate checkin if you booked a suite, and we were attended for Thesa and a wonderful guy that unfortunately I cannot remember his name, just that he was taking some salon dance lessons and he loved tango, our dance. Incredible interesting and polite person!  We were upgraded to a Chairman suite! OMG! You have to live it to be live it! AMAZING!  If you can afford it, it's a must do once in your life if you go to Singapore. It's a whole experience itself. Otherwise just stay at the better suite possible for your budget that will be a great difference in your stay. From the VIP check in, to the rooftop VIP only lounge at the 55th floor offering complementary champagne, drinks, chocolate and different brunch options at all…",5,
"Went to the 57th floor for a drink and got the amazing view as well! The bar has full views of the bay right round to the city. The drinks are on the expensive side, but nothing any different to what you pay in Australia for a cocktail. It's a lovely experience, but it's not for little children and would be a mess on a rainy day. ",5,
"One of the best hotels I've ever been.  The highlight of this hotel is the swimming pool in the top of the hotel. Big pool where you have view to the skyline of Singapore. And it was open until late at night.  The room was great. Spacious with amazing view to the city.  If you go to Singapore and you won't stay to Marina Bay Sands, it will be a waste of time....! 😉",5,
Infinity pool at 57th floor is the highlight of this hotel. Otherwise the rooms are quite average (for the price you pay) and the lobby is way to crowded all the time with hoardes of tourists.. the food in the hotel is quite average as well...,4,
"Loved everything and every minute of our stay here. Large hotel room with big balcony looking out over gardens in the the bay. The light and sound show on the Supertrees was spectacular viewed from our balcony. Walking distance to Singapore Flyer, F1 track, Merion Park and Gardens in the Bay. Right close to Bayfront MRT to get elsewhere. Infinity pool a must although crowded. Great views day and night. Good to have adult only area of pool and good to see strictly enforced too. Make sure you take your room key as you won't get into the pool without it.  Only downside was no balcony furniture on a lovely spacious balcony seemed a strange decision.",5,
"With its strategic locale alongside the Marina Bay, overlooking the Marina bay financial hub and the Merlion and with a fantastic skypark( the rooftop observatory deck) which gives you a birds eye view and the infinity pool, this is surely one of Singapore's crown jewel.  P.S. Dont miss out on the laser show that free for all general audiences.",5,
"Read a lot of reviews about lining up and crowds being a negative.  If you don't like crowds and lines then this is probably not a place you will enjoy.  We booked a city view club room for 2 nights. On arrival we joined the queue for normal rooms which had about 20 people in it. Staff member checked our paperwork and said in the wrong q and took us to the club room check in.  took about 10 mins to be checked in and up to the room 4171 tower 2.  good views of the harbour and Singapore city. Room was spacious, bathroom fantastic, shower was good, toilet has its own door.  Room was stocked with quality toiletries, second day a swan feature was done at the end of the bed by housekeeping (ladies will love it).  Club room - views great on the 55th floor.  Food was absolutely…",5,
"The hotel with the highest pool in the world, it exceeds all the expectations, has many restaurant and bars in the lobby as in the observation deck. The breakfast is also outstanding, from Asian cuisine to the western one, it can please all the tastes and wishes. It a must stay when in Singapore.",5,
Spacious room with nice amenities within the hotel complex. There's something for everyone to do. Being connected to the mall with a Theater and the Arts and Science Museum is nice since there's a diversity in what people can do. There's also a connection to the Gardens by the Bay.  Bus stop and MRT stop also available. Taxi cabs also available.    Of course there's also a casino for those who want to gamble. It's nice that there is a no smoking area since some people want to go to the casino but are turned off by the smell of smoke.    There are nice dining options within the hotel. Dined at Hide Yamamoto (Japanese) located above the casino and the food and service was excellent.  Jin Shan (Chinese) located at the hotel's lobby offered great afternoon teatime dimsum.   One time…,3,
"Decided to do a 3 day stop over in Singapore on our way to Maldives. Being that Maldives was my destination choice due to quiet and calm surroundings we did the Singapore stopover first for the husband who wanted a more louder scene! I will say he got what he asked for and more. I was advised not to come here by a fellow trip advisor and I will say it's worth seeing, a night would have been enough though. I can only explain it as 'welcome to obnoxious Ville' it hurt to be by the pool. iPads and and phones attached to people who sit by the infinity pool hours on end taking hundreds of selfies! I spotted a group who had wardrobe changes for the afternoon so same view different bikini or hat. I felt I was in the middle of so many photo shoots never seen so many types of cameras. If…",5,
The rooms are very spacious and even have a walk out balcony from the room which makes it feel like your on top of the world. The downside is that it's so humid that you don't really want to sit on your balcony.   The iconic pool with overlooks the city is in reality really narrow and long and more like a waddle pool for each section as its not really possible to swim across! ,4,
"Great swimming pool and spacey rooms. The view is stunning, make sure you have a room on one of the top floors. Plenty of nearby attractions. Check-in can take a while  as there are queues. You can leave your luggage in the luggage room after checking out if you plan to hang around the marina bay.",4,
The Singaporean friendly way is on display here everyday. When I stay at hotels I always find something I don't like but the only thing I can fault is the hot cold lever in shower was hard to control. Otherwise everything else was great. I thoroughly recommend people stay at this hotel.,5,
"With a price of over HKD3000 a night for this hotel, it was totally disappointing: 1. They initially  gave us a floor on the 5th floor facing a road like a highway with no views at all while they have other rooms available. When we requested for change, they were unfriendly and mechanical. Whilst they agreed to the change, they made you feel you have done something wrong to ask. 2. The bathroom floor was very slippery. My daughter fell down and bruised with dry feet walking in. We nearly fell too. 3. There was a dead insect lying on our bedsheets that was over 1cm long.  4. The curtains were falling off with light touches.  5. The reception staff was unhelpful - could not tell the benefits of staying in the hotel. We need to find out from other sources eg Art Science Museum…",2,
Fantastic view over Singapore. Great cocktails. Can get busy and hard to get a seat. There is a restaurant there but have not eaten there. It's lovely to go there to watch the sunset! Lots of restaurants in the hotel to eat. Worth a visit and good cocktails!,5,
"MBS is a place not to be missed in singapore !!! infinity pool is an experience in itself .... extremely courteous staff..complimentary upgradation of our room was like cherry on the cake...Lavish breakfast , grand modern rooms and excellent hospitality ....PURE INDULGENCE !!!",5,
"Best view of city from top deck and top floor swimming pool , one stop all you will get all things in one stop . Spectacular sunset view if weather is good. i prefer the city view room. Excellent view of the laser show at night. After becoming the Sand Reward member, high speed Wifi become...",5,
"If you have the money to splurge, MBS is the best hotel in Singapore. Although the lobby can be so busy because of the sheer number of visitors, once you get to your wel-appointed room (ours had the garden view), you wouldn't want to get out anymore. The buffet breakfast and lunch is so good (the best we had in Singapore so far), you would be tempted to stay and eat until they close the buffet spread. We spent most of our limited time (we can only afford one night in MBS for my birthday) in the infinity pool - you just have to get used to all the people. Near sunset, the pool was packed with guests that you cannot swim anymore. Everyone wants to have a selfie in the pool with the sunset in the background. All in all, it was well worth what we paid for.",5,
"Marina bay sands is a hotel that has to be tried to experience the rooftop pool, which is excellent but also very busy. Upon check in we were upgraded to a suite, which was enormous, massive lounge room and office with toilet, and huge bedroom with ensuite and large balcony with access from bedroom or lounge room. The room was very modern and well equipped. However I think this hotel is a one stay only place, it's just too large and manically busy to really relax in. Overall I enjoyed the experience and the rooftop pool really is breathtaking, but I think next time I would stay somewhere else in Singapore ",4,
"* The enormous structure is one of the biggest attractions of Singapore for good reason  * Huge very modern beautiful suite.  * Very good breakfast.  * Hotel/expensive shopping mall/ casino in one.       Lots of quality restaurants also.  * Incredible large swimming pool on top of the hotel with a beautiful view of the Singapore skyline.  * Does not feel like a typical hotel more a huge complex that happens to ve rooms also.  A bit unpersonal ( you check out yourself, etc) ",5,
I just feel like VIP and realy enjoyed .. all treatment was first class ..  i stayed 5 days and not going anywhere .. spent my time in all MBS facilities and also mall & casino ..   But the pool very noisy and crowded .. maybe because Aidil Fitri holiday ..  But thats Awesome overall ..,5,
"What an amazing hotel this is.  I recently stayed here for 3 nights on business and was in Tower 1 on the 31st floor.  Great views of the gardens across the road. The room was large, great balcony and a really workable bathroom. Bed comfort was wonderful. The room staff were fantastic.The infinity pool on the 57th floor is simply WOW!  I really look forward to visiting again.",5,
"Great infinity pool, only wash room but no changing room. Water is not as warm as expected. High altitude pool at top of skyscraper may really make it 'cool'. Spectacular sunset view if weather is good. i prefer the city view room. Excellent view of the laser show at night. After becoming the Sand Reward member, high speed Wifi become free of charge. Also 30% discount of some hotel restaruant buffets from Monday to Thursday.",4,
"I stayed 5 days in MBS , i had enjoyed my stay to the Maximum and i can definitely say that it's the best hotel i have ever been to  Delicious Breakfast Buffet with huge variety that satisfy all tastes , friendly staff and  lovely room will all essential amenities , now to the best part of the root cause of this hotel fame , the top floor swimming pool could be one of the to do items in your list , it's just mind-blowing   Highly Recommended !",5,
"Service, rooms, amenities, comfort, view just great as expected for a 5* hotel, but...there were two things that made our stay a little unpleasant. The hotel reception is quite small and guests at check in were staying in really long queue so I went to ask whether this is truly a check in line. The fact that the hotel is attraction by itself is clear, inspite of that, however it should not make its guests feel like standing in an attraction line. The second thing that made us upset was that we (and also the other guests we met when strolling around the pool) were unable to find a single ONE pool longue at least just to drop our belongings. Everything else was super fine!",4,
"I stayed with my Family and it was a memory for the history. The words can't express how amazing was the infinity pool on the 57th floor. Our room view was on garden by the bay which was great, but I think the view on the other side facing the Merlin will be more beautiful. The hotel lobby is so crowded, to the extend you can feel that you are in an airport not a hotel lobby. I enjoyed it so much and I wish I can stay there again soon.",5,
"We have stayed with my husband in Feb for 1 night only, but fully enjoyed it. The pool is speechless of course. It`s good that it`s not crowded as I thought it would be. The room is definitely the best room I have stayed in.",5,
Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights in June with living with absolute luxury. I loved the pool and such good restaurants and shopping attached. The rooms were clean with fantastic views. I highly recommend staying here if you want complete 5 star service. ,5,
This was my third time at this delightful and extravagant hotel but every visit reminds me of why i absolutely adore singapore! Kenny at the check in reception was a stand out with his customer service whom also upgraded us to a balcony room with a garden view which i have never even stayed in before. One could say Kenny was crucial to our perfect experience at Marina Bay Sands! THANKS KEN :),5,
"Huge mall, hotel, casino etc. Lots of stores, restaurants and everything - almost to much. But nice location and easy to find whatever you need. In the evening nice lasershow and excellent view from rooftop.  Also centrally located for further exploration in the centre of the city. ",4,
"We have expected this hotel to be one of the best in the world for us, but it turned out to be much worse. All problems are related to the huge crowds of visitors. This hotel is the mass one rather than luxury one (despite its high price).  Queues are everywhere: near check-in/check-out stations, near the lifts, at the pool and etc. It was extremely uncomfortable for us. Maybe for this reason also, service in not very good here. Such quality may be ok for some 4* hotel in Europe, but definitely not ok for 5* hotel in Singapore. For example, there is just one room cleaning during the day. By the way, rooms are little bit empty, and bathroom fixtures are low-quality.  There is just one great plus here - Sands SkyPark and Infinity Pool. I think, everybody is familiar with it from…",5,
"The room was great with a beautiful scenery of the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage. Beds, toilet facilities and air-con are all up to satisfaction! Love the infinity pool at the rooftop which provided a great view of the cities during the day and night. However, it might get a little bit too crowded for swimming. Still, I enjoyed the view! There are access to many shopping malls too.",5,
"We stayed two nights and loved every minute of it. The most spectacular views from our room which was located with a city view on the 27th floor. The room was lovely with a comfy king size bed including a beautiful bathroom with large seperate bath. The view from the roof top pool took my breath away and I could of stayed there my whole trip with out going elsewhere quite happily. The only downer was the arrival and departure concierge service which I thought was not up to standard for this class of hotel, there was large waits and no class. Easy access to gardens by the sea, which is definitely a must see. Breakfast was expensive and if we were to stay again I would not get. Overall experience was great, the best pool ever :)",5,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands recently at the tail end of our holiday.  We had just spent 2 weeks in Vietnam and decided to spend 3 nights at Marina Bay Sands on our way home.  We chose MBS because I've always wanted to swim in the rooftop infinity pool.  It didn't disappoint.  The pool is super busy, it's a big hotel, but despite this we managed to get loungers for our family and enjoy swimming in the pool.   We are a family with two teenage children.  We booked a family suite located on the 3rd floor.  The room was really nice.  It was big, approximately twice the size of a normal hotel room with a really large outdoor deck. The configuration was 1 x king bed and 2 x single beds, with a couch/lounge in between. There were two bathrooms and they were both really nice.  Check in…",5,
"What an incredible place, as only you will find in Singapore.  Everything you could possibly want to do is either in the complex or within 200 metres walk.  And, Yes, that well publicised Roof Top Pool is the most incredible experience.  Restaurants, Rooms, Shops, the list goes on and on.  Treat yourself to a Couples Massage in the Day Spa.",5,
"We stayed at this hotel for three nights while on vacation in Singapore. The hotel is most famous for its rooftop infinity pool on the 57th floor, accessible only to hotel guests. The decor is modern, and windows in the hotel are designed to maximize the view. The room had two double (full-sized) beds, was larger than the average hotel room, and had a beautiful bathroom with sliding door, separate door to the toilet, and a walk-in shower. The shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were also a larger volume than average, and amenities included a sewing kit, dental kits, and shower cap. Telephones are present at the desk in the room, and also in the bathroom. There is no refrigerator space other than the minibar, but refrigerators are available for an additional fee at…",4,
"I did not stay at the hotel,just visited Rise lobby restaurant for a superb buffet dinner.Although not cheap it was absolutely worth dining.Fantastic range of food! I was happy with the variety of sea food I love the most.A choice of delicious oysters,prawns and fish of all kinds! I wish I had had at least 3 stomachs-1 for sea food,1 for delicious desserts and 1 for great fruit of all possible kinds! Amazing feast!",5,
"Impressive hotel,giant pool on the roof,nice staff and perfect for shorts stays ,you have also a casino.Very good breakfast.A little bit crowdy because a lot of people inside.Excellents views.Close to everywhere in Singapur.Of course I recommend it.",5,
Singapore is one of the highlights of Asia and this hotel proves it even further. From shopping to relaxation this is a paradise. Perfect for first timers of Singapore and also to those who just wants to a place to chill in a luxury way.,5,
"You want a hotel with something different and a wow factor. This is it. Not only will this leave your jaw open when you see it from the outside but also when your at the top in the pool over looking the city. Friendly staff, nice size rooms, all you need for a great stay. Taxi is a cheap way to get around and also your close to all the spots to go visit. With the shopping mall down stairs its easy to get a bite to eat or a tad of shopping. Luxary at its best. Love Singapore and will go back first chance i get .",5,
Easily accessible via train. You have to learn to use the metro to get around the city.  Lobby 1 was very crowded with tour groups etc. checking in. There was no line for Lobby 2 or 3. Check in was fast and easy and I got the room early. Beautiful bathroom and facilities. Very clean room and spacious enough for 3 adults.,5,
"Stayed here finally after many trips to Singapore, had to try it. Whilst the hotel is nice and great location above the shopping centre, its just too big and deviod of personality to be one of the truly great world hotels. The pool is amazing, as reviewed below but pissed me off that you need a room card EACH to get into the pool area (tip for those on reception- please TELL your clients this on check-in!!). We ate at the restaurant on the top floor and whilst is a vast improvement on years gone by, its too expensive to come back again. The hotel is a box-ticker, thats all. ",4,
"A humongous hotel with 3 towers. Actually, you need to book Uber with the tower number so you can catch your ride. I guess more than 2000 people are around the hotel on busy days. Nevertheless, room service was exceptional. I have not been recently to a hotel with such a level of caring.  Connected to a 5-start shopping mall with 5-star brands only.  The only draw back was my disappointment with the roof top pool. It was very crowded so I gave up swimming and returned back to me room. ",5,
"Sometimes when I read reviews of some hotels on here and then stay there I wonder if I'm staying in the same place! It has to be said if you want a quirky, boutique hotel with a very personalised service then this is not the place for you. On the other hand if your on holiday Singapore and you went the best view of this city, that you won't ever forget, attentive staff, top quality food in a good location then this is the place to go.  We stayed here for three nights. Check in was fast and efficient, the staff very helpful and polite, the room was a good size and immaculately clean and tidy, we were on the 38th floor of tower three over looking the bay which was fantastic. We swam in the amazing pool 4 times and at different times of the day. Frankly I was surprised how quiet it…",5,
"First time in Singapore .. And choosing to stay at this hotel was the best decision I made! It is absolutely amazing! Has so much to offer with three towers,casino, shopping etc and close proximity to walk to the gardens by the bay. If the above hasn't sold you the infinity pool will.. Best view of Singapore city. Worth the money!",5,
Stayed many times in the past few years. No complains. Will stay again whenever I am in Singapore. Only thing is its always full so booking rooms is a must. Enjoy the 57th floor pool and breakfast. Maybe provide more area for smokers. Overall good and enjoyable stay each time.,5,
"Our family spent our Christmas vacation in Singapore, and we booked for 3 days/2 nights (Dec 25-27, 2015). We did not encounter any problem during our check in. There was a queue since it's the holiday season but the people at the check in counter made sure that they quickly assist all those in line waiting and so it did not take us too long to finish our check in. The kids enjoyed our room - we got a king size bed.. It was big and clean... but it would be best however, if there was  a daybed of sort to do your readings instead of.  I personally loved the welcome fruit platter - strawberry with chocolates. It made us feel really special!   The kids wanted to just stay at the hotel and swim all day. We all loved the infinity pool.. the water is crystal clear!  The location is…",5,
"We had a ""staycation"" here for a night to see what it has to offer and checkout the infinity pool that is the talk of town. We got a room with a City View and it was magnificient. Definitely one of the best city views I have ever seen. Mini bar system is automated (if you remove something from its rack you will get charged), so you don't get any annoying knocks on the door to check the minibar in the morning or the evenings and you can just drop your key in the express checkout box and leave. We stayed over the weekend and the lobby was so crowded it looked like there was a megasale there. The inifinity pool was also crowded but we still managed to get a nice spot by the side of the pool to look at the view, so no complaints there. Despite the huge crowd, the staff managed to…",5,
"Perfect view, excelent accomodations, great location, friendly people. Mall, cassino, restaurants, beauty salon, stores, everything near the hotel. The rooftop pool is amazing! You can walk around the hotel peacefully. It's a trip To remember! Loved it! ",5,
"Would recommend staying her for a couple of nights to use their famous infinity pool. We had a room on the club floor which gives you access to the club lounge on the 55th floor which offers breakfast and afternoon snacks and alcoholic beverages included. If staying in a club room request to stay in tower 2 where the club floor is, we were in tower 1 and had to take a few elevators up and down to access tower 2 and the club floor. Try and go to the pool mid afternoon when everyone is out for a shop. Not exactly a place where you want to relax, pool and lobby swarming with people.",4,
I travelled to this hotel for a two day work conference.  Marina Bay Sands certainly went above and beyond for us!  We were a very large group and everything felt flawless.   Check in was very well organized and rooms were available right upon arrival. Certainly a nice touch.  Of course with the 57th floor roof top pool it offers the best views of the city as well.  If I had to say anything negative - the free internet is pretty touch and go. There is a purchased internet option if need just a shame the free isn't just a touch better!  Looking forward to being able to return one day soon!,5,
"This was suppose to be my Birthday treat but was treated rudely and was totally lost in food service. I rang lobby to find out what time the restaurant closed they said 11pm, when after getting dressed up and getting to the restaurant at 9.45pm after being stopped rudely on the way was told it was closed!  I was so disappointed and complained in the lobby and they suggested I go out but by this time it was already 10.15 and called a taxi which took us to street the lobby suggested that was closed and wasted $55 round trip back to the hotel hungry. Complained again but by that time they were so useless in direction and sense of time and totally wasted my money on taxi and going hungry! Bad service indeed...so disappointed with such a high rated hotel. I've been to many 5-6 star…",2,
"As a frequent traveler to Singapore I've stayed in many of the best hotels.  I'd hoped to have 2 memorable nights here recently on a quick business trip.   The queue to check in took nearly 30 minutes!   This is a major failure on the part of management.   Once I checked in there was no one to help me with my bags so I schlepped them up to the room myself.   I noticed an odd smell in the elevator.  Not sure what it was.  But it was not nice.   The room itself was average for a 3 star hotel not one at this price range.  The views were quite nice, but I've stayed at the Swissotel (and Westin before that) so that wasn't the thrill.  I'd previously seen the unimpressive (by Las Vegas standards) casino.  This time I wanted to head to the roof and infinity pool.   The views from there…",2,
"Our check in was easy, the service polite, our room comfortable. All of those things though, do not compare to that incredible pool! If all my time in Singapore could have been just hanging out there, I would have been happy. Just the view alone, was worth it. The drinks, as everything in Singapore are very expensive.  They staff was very sweet and when finding out it was our anniversary, gave us a 'mocktail' and a signed postcard. Just a wonderful experience!",5,
"My husband and I came to Marina Bay Sands as part of the second leg of our honeymoon. Entering the hotel was very chaotic due to the huge volume of taxis and cars arriving and leaving the small space outside the hotel, many of the parking attendants were rude and remained oblivious to lost folk, not quite knowing if they had the correct entrance.  The hotel reception area was split for those checking in and those leaving but adequate seating areas are not available for those of you not wanting to buy an expensive drink at the nearest bar, just to be able to sit down and wait to be attended to.    We were very grateful for a room upgrade but unfortunately were let down when we had to find our own way to our room.  In such a big hotel and with no explanation as to the difference…",4,
"Marina Bay is everything I thought it would be. From the entrance of the hotel, to the skypark, the food and the rooms...this place just screams luxury. The rooms are huge, modern, clean and comfortable. We got a room on the 3rd tower on the 43rd floor. Our room had these roof to floor windows that over looks the bay. The skypark is incredible. The view from the 57th floor is amazing. The only one complaint I have is if u would like to dine or have breakfast on the roof be prepared to pay for it. We had breakfast at the sky park and it was $50 per person for a buffet. The breakfast was ok. But wasnt worth 50. I loved staying here. Its in such a good location and is an absolutely stunning hotel. I would highly recommend it.",4,
"Brilliant Hotel, exceptional staff. We were checked-in at the back of the front desk in the VIP Lounge. Could only stay one night - you need three at least. MUST DO LIST. Roof Top Pool & Drinks Spa Light show Join the rewards Club Dinner - the buffet- amazing !!! Shopping in the plaza via the Hotel............. All we had time for on this trip",5,
"I live Marina Bay Sand for three nights. I am not satisfied with the inefficiency for check in process and when we arrived hotel, no one is willing to move our luggage which normally will be taken by some hotel employees. In addition, the lift has some control system problem. When I tap the card to go up, it can't read, until I change another lift to solve the problem. Another event is that when I try to go to 1st floor, the lift went down to certain level and then started to go up again.   The service attitude is ok but I can't feel the enthusiasm. The toilet in the room doesn't have electric toilet seat which should be normal in 5 star hotel.  In conclusion, no worth of money, too many visitors in this hotel. I think I would choose this hotel again.",3,
I stayed at the Sands Suite and it was really spacious. The dinning area was fully equip and the toilet facilities were complete and good. The hifi system was average and the view was fantastic given that it faces the bay and shenton area plus the high level of the suite .,4,
"Visited the hotel many times and first time i met this guy. Thumbs up to Mr. Dennis guest attendant at sky park / pool.. Very accommodating, friendly and putting customer first. Keep up the good work and i hope your company will always keep this kind of asset that they have.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is an iconic building, iconic hotel. It facilitates for thousands and thousands of people and I imagine that everyone leaves with pleasant memories. I did. Check-in was quick. The service was good. I had a room with the view over the ArtScience museum and Gardens. The room was well laid out but in need of modernisation (the carpet in the room was worn out). The bed was comfortable, and soft. The room service was timely and good food. The hotel is part of a mega shopping mall. One word: awesome! Ku de ta (night club) is a fabulous club with great skyline view of the city. The whole sky deck of the hotel (including the roof top pool) is awesome. Remarkable experience. The service was fabulous.  I used the Baytree Spa. It was a total bask in luxury. It is not by…",4,
"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for the weekend of July 18,2016  Amazing! We used the Expo ,ballrooms, pools, private lounges.. It was all amazing.  Service was smooth, check in was fast and people were very friendly.  Located in the Marina District(obviously) downtown, china town, little India are all very close.  Love this place!! I will return!",5,
"We stayed for three nights. Lovely room, well kept by the housekeeping team. Very helpful and friendly staff on reception and in the restaurants. The view from the pool is unforgettable,  and we also ate breakfast up there each morning. On the last day there was a storm,  but the staff carried on bravely, and we enjoyed a windy breakfast. Best to get a room above the 30th floor to save time in the lift. Highly recommended. ",5,
The lights of the city make this a really special place for drinks before dinner. The day I visited there were fireworks which were great from this vantage point. Although I wasn't dining myself the food looked very good but it's also expensive. ,5,
"Stayed here for 8 days and took us most of that just looking around the hotel and using the facilities. Casino, infinity pool, shopping mall, bars, restaurants, marina bay gardens, coffee shops, spas and I could go on and on. I got the idea that 50% were not residence of the hotel and we're just there to experience the facilities. Being a club guest gets you extra perks and access to all areas. Rooms was nice views of marina bay, it was modern clean and had all the amenities needed.  Would recommend stay at this hotel even for a few nights of you stay. ",5,
"Booked this hotel just to experience the famous infinity pool. If you booked for a room with no assurance of level they can place you from 2nd floor onwards. So to get a secured higher view, then you have to pay more. The room is great, everything inside is good.  The tv channels lost it's signal at 2 Am till 6AM. We also had sudden power shutdown but the electrician came very quick. Overall nice experience.= but prepare for the budget. We were able to check in early without extra charges at @ 11AM. Very fast elevator.",5,
"Stayed 3 nights in this hotel, room was astonishing, amenities was great and breakfast was awesome. the best part of the hotel is the shoppe and the infinity pool. A recommended hotel for a sweet escape with the family.",5,
"We stayed for 2 nights on a short trip to Singapore.  From the 15 minute tour of our room when our bags were delivered, the tone was set for the whole stay.  Staff were excellent and attentive.  Despite the large numbers of people on the pool level it certainly did not feel crowded and was not difficult to find a lounge. This was a ten out of ten stay and have already booked our next stay. Is now my go to hotel in Singapore.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is surely one of the most iconic place in Singapore. And it is also made to be touristy. With its 2.500 rooms, it's huge and impressive. Lobby hall is always full with people coming in and out that sometimes it's hard to imagine this a hotel. Yes, it's inevitably busy: elevators, halls, restaurants, decks... Front desk was efficient and attentive. During check-in the clerk gave us some hints about Singapore and the hotel itself, like being at the pool early in the morning to avoid the crowd. Believe: the hotel's top-highlight is full packed all day long! We've got a room on the 37th floor which had an amazing view of the city. It was truly spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was huge and spotless although towels showed to be threadbare. Service is not that…",4,
"Came here for a work conference and it definitely has the facilities to host 3,000+ people. We did a private check in for our event which was quick and efficient.   The rooms were great, clean and spacious. All the rooms I saw had a great view.   The conference facilities were incredible. Since the property is so big it doesn't feel as busy as it was.   The only negative I have for the hotel itself is that during peak times, the elevators are extremely slow and frustrating. When we were checking out, we must have waited about 15-20 minutes for one that actually had enough space for 2 people and luggage. Very annoying. For a hotel that size that hosts thousands of guests on a regular basis you'd think this would be worked out a bit better. I heard of people actually getting…",4,
"Its hard to describe the scale of thus hitel comolex. It's simply huge! Very clean and it has its own very high end shopping centre. Every brand is catered for! We stayed in room 777, tower 1. View onto shopping center but quit large!! Other rooms higher up - better views but not as big. Spotless clean. Clientele look rather wealthy. Be aware of all the conferences that take place it can get very busy at the tower elevators. ",5,
"I was lucky enough to stay here on a business trip with work and was blown away!  The sheer size and scale of the place is truly epic and in three days I wasn't able to explore the whole place.  Highlights included: very comfortable bed, excellent and courteous room service, amazing views, and shopping was only across the road as part of the complex.  Downside and I only have one critique and that is that the lifts on occasion were unbearably slow. Some of my colleagues had to wait 45 minutes to get down from their room!  All in all a fantastic stay and I would love to return to the property and stay again soon!",5,
"It was a amazing experience to see the whole area , I prefer at night a very good combination with Marine Bay  I took many pictures from there.The surroundings area was amazing, I spent 2 days walking around there.",5,
"we booked 2 city view Rooms. but they upgraded to a fantastic Suite 5038. the Rooms was huge, with karaoke room,grand piano,fitness room,massage room, 4 toiltes,2 zaccuzis,walk in closet,beauty room, office room, etc..  massive setting area with a stunning city view..we were sooo LUCKY  to have just such a beautiful suite..one of the BEST HOLIDAYs we ever had..we had access Club 55..the INFINITY POOL is amazing...the staff were brilliant, the food was excellent. the staff were friendly and helpful.. we definitely recommend it. and we cant wait to go back soon!",5,
"Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff were lovely. The beds were so comfy. The selection of food at breakfast was the best I have ever seen. The rooms were beautiful. The view from the room was stunning. The infinity pool was first class. The views at night from the 57th floor were breathtaking. You can see the light show at the Gardens at the Bay from the top. There is loads to do in and around this hotel too, top location. ",5,
"Beautiful hotel, great staff!  Amazing rooftop infinity pool!  Very close to the subway, so you don't even have to use taxis or rental cars!  You can do almost everything at this hotel, they offer a large variety of restaurants, shops, even a casino!  We definitely recommend this hotel!",5,
Stayed for a night in a deluxe room room neatly decorated with a Swan towel on bed comes with complimentary coffee and tea but there was quite a handful amount of dust at the top of the lighting furnishing when it's a 5 star hotel establishment but it could have been overlooked at also TV channels should be in HD and limited foreign channels Facilities are good like the skypool and skypark are top of the attractions recommend visting again..,4,
"Booked a family staycation to enjoy the fireworks. Experience was amazing and well worth it as we didn't have to jostle with the crowd. Room was very spacious, which is great for a little one to run around. Housekeeping was great too- we used tissue and tape to tape the table corners and our housekeeping staff, Jia Chun, made the extra effort to tape the table corners with face towels! That's what I call service indeed.  There was quite a variety at breakfast with the usual chinese dim sum, cereals, cooked breakfast, fruit juices etc. The wait staff was kind enough to bring a crayon with a coloring picture to keep the little one occupied.  The highlight of course is the infinity pool. It is perpetually crowded but it's slightly easier to get a spot the earlier you go. It's also…",5,
Well the best part about this hotel is the Rooftop pool and bar. Exquisite piece of architecture and design. The rooms are just basic with nothing really special. Service also is not upto the mark and expected better.,3,
"A friend was here for business trip. The room was huge and spacious with balcony which is facing  Garden by the bay. There are other rooms which are facing the sea. Hotel is a huge building with luxury goods boutiques, casino and the sky park which is the level of the infinity pool. There is a satay club or food center at the rear end of  the Gardens by the Bay.",4,
This was my 2nd trip to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore for a work conference.  The hotel itself is huge and luxurious and it has all of the facilities available you could or would need during your stay. The pool deck on the 57th floor is immaculate with plenty of space to sun yourself and has incredible views day or night out to the city.  My only gripe is the costs of buying anything from the minibar. Having weight monitored systems inside the fridge means you cannot use the facility for anything but what the hotel has provided and be charged large sums for it($8 SGD for a small can of Coke! is an example) Even just moving an item from the shelf means a charge to your room account.   Rooms are spacious and well appointed and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was also large with…,4,
"This is probably a Singapore icon by now.  Everyone and their grandmas wants a photo of the infinity pool.  Besides the pool and location nothing else is very spectacular about this hotel.  Rooms are decent. premium rooms have are decently sized but don't expect luxury. everything about the place is 3.5 stars.  the garden view rooms have a balcony which I find extremely 80s. Hotels in the 80s all had balconies. Seems slightly out of place but not a negative.  Service from hotel staff ranges from great and friendly  (housekeeping, bell service) to down right incompetent (most of the front desk staff are incompetent)  Checking-in is confusing and time consuming.  Long lines are caused not by the sheer number of guests but rather by the ineptitude of the check-in staff. Food choice…",3,
"This hotel is huge!!! Its amazing to see its day to day running , Arcitecture and of course the roof pool views ! firstly we got a free upgrade being on honeymoon to a ""slighty bigger room"" , the room had great views of the gardens from 41st floor  TIP: ask for a view of the bay / city",4,
"Heard a lot about this hotel. Was very excited when I got the opportunity to stay there. Was looking forward to it. The reception team was very pleasant and quick, they were in fact apologetic about the few minutes delay that I had faced. The lobby of the hotel is so huge but is also crowded. Felt like I was in a mall. The rooms were spacious, clean and well maintained.  The elevators were a bit slow and were stopping on most floors. The pool on the top was always packed, amazing view from the top. The breakfast at the lobby restaurant is a treat. The variety offered is amazing and the service team at the restaurant were very attentive, polite and helpful. A pleasant experience and a must stay hotel when in Singapore.",4,
"The hotel itself is nothing special in terms of the rooms. The best part is definitely the view from the top floor and the infinity pool. I'll never forget it. The pool is super crowded though.  Service wasn't great from hotel staff, but I did enjoy how close it was to everything. The promenade shops are lovely. Overall, the hotel is quite packed all the time so be prepared for it not to be the most relaxing spot.   Sad our yoga on the top floor got cancelled due to rain but I recommend it if you get a sunny day. Gym is well equipped and has that signature view as well.",4,
"We stayed at MBS for one night due to the cost, just to experience the pool etc and can say I stayed there. The hotel was huge and so are the rooms. Total luxury. We were lucky to get the 54th floor overlooking the gardens and the harbour. It has a large shopping  centre attached with a food court for cheaper eating as the restaurants are very expensive but I am sure are well worth it. Also has Casino and theatre attached. Good viewing to see the light show at night.  I would stay there again.",5,
I went to Singapore as part of a large conference delegation. What a massive property!!! It was great for what we needed however the pure size of the property is one of its downfalls. We waited a very long time to get into lifts as there was a large line of people. This also happened when we were trying to check out. The quality and service of the hotel is excellent and the rooms are very large with king single beds which did make a huge difference to our stay.  Breakfast was very expensive so if you can venture out to get something then I would recommend that.  The pool has an amazing view however with that many guests staying in house it can get quite uncomfortable and hard to get loungers.  As we were part of a conference I am not sure what the room rates were but I can…,4,
My husband and I spent four nights here last month. I must say the building itself is awe inspiring and absolutely amazing. The view magnificent. We were on the city side on 49th floor. This side of the hotel has floor to ceiling Windows but no balcony. Great proximity to the gardens by the bay and of course the shops downstairs. Must say I was a little disappointed to see most guests getting around in their robes and slippers on the rooftop and by the pool even though the hotel states these are to only be worn in the room. Made the place feel more like a health spa than a luxury resort. The rooftop is also open to non hotel guests which added to the busy feel of the restaurant/bars on the rooftop. ,4,
Amazing hotel with amazing service. We got the suite and it was very nice. The hotel has many restaurants and amazing rooftop pool. The mall was also very nice. The people there are very friendly. There is everything to do in the hotel.,5,
Is the first place I visit in singapore.Amazing hotel with casino ' e shopping centre. The luxury place  Many different restaurants available,5,
"My wife and I spend 3 days in Singapore as a side trip from her hometown of Jakarta. I have always seen images of the iconic rooftop pool and thought to myself that I just had to experience it once in my life. It turns our you must be a guest of the Marina Bay Sands hotel to access the pool (I thought a day pass could be purchased). So, I booked a two night stay and away we went. This hotel is NOT cheap but the short stay was worth it to experience the pool. So if this is on your life's bucket list, as I always say: do it.  Some positives about the hotel: well appointed rooms with automated blinds and beautiful marble bathrooms and big comfortable beds with high end linen. This hotel ticks off all those boxes. You even have your own balcony to soak in views of either the…",4,
"Was really looking forward to my stay, but was disappointed overall. The hotel is extremely commercial trying to get people in and out as quickly as possible with no individual attention or the ability to cater to individual needs e.g. families. On the plus side, the pool was amazing (if you can get past all the selfie sticks), and the food at the club was excellent! Couple of tips: The Club Lounge is in Tower 2 with no direct access from Tower 1 or 3 - you need to change lifts which is inconvenient. Club Lounge access ends at 8pm (differs from other club lounges) and for the evening hors d'oeuvres at the Club Lounge, you have to get there early otherwise you'll have to wait a while for a table!",3,
"Stayed at MBS for a work conference recently.  It is a BIG hotel, so not always what you want. But no doubt it is still a good hotel and very cool with the roof top pool and all the restaurants and bars.    Hotel is still modern and in good condition and rooms are a good size.  ",4,
"It is a massive hotel but still has 5 star views, service and all the added luxuries you need. Our room was huge with spectacular views of the skyline. Great big bathroom with separate walk in shower, separate toilet, etc.",5,
"Exceptional service, so many people helping out constently and so eager for the guests to be simply happy and enjoy the stay. Have always compared other hotels against this one. But none came close!",5,
"Just spent 4 days in Singapore attending a Conference  and staying at Marina Bay Sands.   Excellent Conference facility. Good hotel with a great swimming pool and gym - not to mention the rooftop bar and restaurants.  Just a warning though, drinks not cheap up the top.   Enjoy your stay   ",5,
"Massive & amazing. Its like its own town. People every where. Amazing building. Rooms great, wifi excellent. Bakery at Tower 3 a great place for breakfast, good coffee. easy access to shopping & gardens.  The pool....what they don't tell you is that every guest has to take their door card for entry. The pool is an experience in its self. its huge, unbelivablly busy, with every imaginable person in it. I wouldn't recommend putting you head under water, but my kids did & they are still alive!!  What I loved the most was the restaurants. World class chefs in a small area offering excellent food.  Make sure that if you need three beds in the room you get an email confirmation. We spent an hour at check in...hmm",4,
"Staying in Bay suites that facing Gardens by the Bay with my family.  Amazing service, during my mother's birthday, the staff give a birthday cake and macaroons and water bottle always topped up everyday. Mini bar is free (except the alcoholic drink)  Pool is nice, although i recommend go in the morning, because afternoon- evening is very crowded.  Breakfast is really good, a lot of varieties. Also Canape time 5-7 is also delightful.",5,
"We have stayed at the marina bay sands a number of times now and have not been disappointed. Last visit we chose to have city views which was lovely but the garden view on the other side of the hotel is also great especially watching the lights at night. The infinity pool and rooftop area is fantastic, pictures don't do this area justice. We will always stay here on any stopovers needed in Singapore. The shopping centre linked is great and also access to the train line only a short distance away",5,
My Singapore vacation was superb because I choose to stay here. The rooms are very spacious. Very clean.  Good room service. It's worth the price. Very polite and friendly staff. Customer service is excellent. They were very helpful. Foods are great. Very delicious. And perfect view in the 57th floor. The pool was very amazing. Perfect view especially at night! Overlooking  the Bay and Gardens. I will definitely visit this place again in the future.,5,
"I spent two nights here when I was travelling with my fiance. A truly excellent hotel, we were very impressed. The staffs were so nice and helpful, the infinity pool was too die for. We were very lucky that it was sunny, so the view was breathtaking. Such a romantic weekend.",5,
This hotel is amazing and beautiful and busy and everything you could ever want. We actually stayed here October 2014 arriving at 4 in the morning. That didn't matter we were welcomed as normal and shown to our amazing room. The room had a view of the wonderful Gardens by the Bay which we visited and were oh so impressed by. The hotel is obviously quite expensive but so worth it. The malls throughout and underneath are amazing and you can even take a gondola ride as if you're in Venice. Highly recommend even just for a night. ,5,
"We spent a week in Singapore catching up with friends. My first time in Singapore. I have fallen in love with this city.   Marina bay sands has so much going for it; great shopping, the views, the night time light show, boat trips around the bay, restaurants, nightlife.   Cannot say how much I love this place. Singapore must be on your bucket list. I will be back again. ",5,
"Upgraded to a suite on the 54th floor with amazing view of the Bay and Gardens especially at night with the lights show. Excellent service and will definitely recommend to swim in the pool on the 57th floor. Have to go very early to see the sunrise as it can get very crowded and noisy around the pool area. Food court is very good with delicious and reasonable priced dishes to cater for all visitors.Used the MRT to get around,cheap,clean and efficient.",5,
"Booked a City View Club Suite, room was spacious and view is spectacular.. But one shortcoming, room needs a refurbish. Housekeeping was great. And little surprise when check in with a little birthday cake. Would be great for short getaway.",5,
"Huge hotel, the centrepoint of Singaporewith its unique design. Stayed 2 nights on business, room on the 49th floor had great views of the city. Room itself was spacious and very comfortable, bed was fantastic and there was no outside noise whatsoever. Large bathroom and huge shower. Rooftop pool is great, and again offers amazing views. Drinks extremely overpriced. No aircon in the elevators (?) and they get very hot very quickly when you get a few people in there! Gardens in the bay are directly opposite, and the hotel is connected via walkway to shopping mall, convention centre and harbourfront shoppes. Great hotel, but I would not pay the rates they charge for rooms or food if given the choice.",4,
"Super location with all the facilities you can imagine of! The view from the hotel is great regardless of which side of the hotel are your rooms facing. You can either chose a city view room or a sea-view room and you will not be disappointed. Shopping, Entertainment, Food are all available with in the hotel or a short-walk away with in the same building in the mall. One cannot ask for more!",5,
"Visited MBS Tower 3, when an overseas friend was staying there. Need to walk to Tower 1 where it linked to the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands where abundance of mid-range and upmarket shopping and eating awaits.  High floor with double bed facing marina bay. Good view of Esplanade, Floating Platform and Marina Square. Huge simple comfortable room with good study area. Huge marble bathroom with standing shower and bath tub.  ",4,
"Wonderful stay in a premier room overlooking cloud forest and flower dome area. Tight security. Need key cards per person to get around. Best view of Singapore on the infinity pool. Clean, huge mall, sands casino, lots of food/restaurant options and shopping, accessible via Smrt. Fitness room has amazing views as well with nice equipment and shower rooms have all you need though a bit small. MBS Is a must visit.",5,
"Comfortable, clean, conveniently located. Friendly staff and reception. Loved proximity to mall and Convention Centre. Lobby boasts great restaurants. Great for leisure and business. Highlight is definitely the Infinity pool... Nothing beats that view! ",4,
Excellent room. Excellent service. What you expect singapore is a complain zone. So they will give you the best of service. Probably you can line them up with the top hotels in the world. But things are expensive around you should travel out to get your stuff. Why worry when we have one of the best transport system in the world.,5,
"Stayed at MBS 2 nights for a work conference, whilst the hotel is huge and pretty amazing I really felt it was overpriced for what it was. Situated above the station so easy to get around, attached to a designer shopping centre for those that love designer labels, celebrity chef restaurants for foodies and a great conference centre for large events.  The rooms were huge, ours overlooked the city from the 43rd floor and the bathroom was great but the decor was average and I didn't think it was worth the $$. Having stayed in quite a few 5 star properties around the world this one didn't quite meet my expectations. Room service  was super expensive $25 AUD for a ham and cheese toastie which took an hour and 15 mins to be delivered... one of the cons of such a huge hotel I guess. …",4,
Had a good time here with my team. We enjoyed our time here during the convention. And i would like to say thank u to RISE Buffet for making my birthday more interesting and i appreciate the small cake u guys made specifically for me on my special day! This is my most memorable birthday venue in my life! Marina bay sand is the best and will be coming back everytime i have a chance! ,5,
"Stayed 2 nights in Family room  (3rd floor Garden View).  Loved the room.  Room was outstanding for 2 adults and two 14 year olds - heaps of room and modern facilities large TV and coffee machine.  Free fast wifi a hit.  BUT..a very busy hotel.  The infinity pool at the top was very busy.  Views amazing, but very crowded.  We dined at buffet which was great for seafood...Friday nights have Chilli Crab!  Be warned this is a very busy hotel.  It is a impressive hotel but.....",4,
"Stayed 2 nights at this hotel but was rather disappointed as we had high expectations after hearing much about this hotel. I'm not sure if it was because we went during peak period but the infinity pool, which is the main highlight of the hotel was packed full of people. It was difficult to get a sunbed and the pool (which was very shallow) was full of people. Avoid the middle section of the pool as there are children screaming and splashing around. We only stayed for 10 minutes to take some photos and left quickly.   The rooms are nothing to shout about except for finding a cute towel folded into an elephant placed on our bed on the 2nd day of our stay. One plus point was our room was on a high floor overlooking Gardens by the Bay. There are no shower curtains/doors in the…",3,
"I'd say this hotel is a bucket list must.  The location and facilities alone make it a worth while stay but be prepared to pay for it.  The lead in room is lovely and large, generous space meant sharing with a friend wasn't a hassle.   The bed and pillows were very comfortable and because our room was on a lower floor we had a balcony over looking the gardens and harbour.  The skypark with infinity pool is AMAZING! It has the best views and definitely worth the price tag for the hotel. Also it is right next to some of the best shopping in Singapore!  Food and beverage at the hotel is expensive. I had a Singapore Sling and it cost $20SGD plus tax!  I found the staff extremely helpful and accommodating.  I would definitely go back, even just for 1 night to use the pool!",4,
Thumbs up to the staff. They are all so friendly and helpful. The hotel is crowded but it doesn't feel stuffy at all. We had a blast here (minus the pool because way too crowded). The room is clean. We requested high floor room and they managed to get us one of the highest floor. My family was very happy. We would definitely come back to this hotel.,5,
"I stayed at MBS for 4 nights for a conference.  The room was very nice with a terrific view of the Gardens by the Sea and the Straits of Malacca.  The frequently replenished water bottles were a nice touch.   The hotel is very popular and is a tourist attraction, which means the lobby and pool are crowded at all hours.  The infinity pool on the roof (57th floor) is amazing.  It was usually crowded but I could always find a well placed empty chaise.  The adult only section was a godsend and the staff did an excellent job keeping kids out of that section.    The hotel is across the street from the convention center and a large multi level upscale mall.  There are good low cost eating options in the food court on the lowest level.   The hotel is on top of the Bayfront subway stop,…",5,
"Checked in here the other day and spent 2 nights.  The check-in was pretty quick and seamless, the usual credit card down protocol.  They put me in Tower 1 on the 42nd floor, the lifts are super quick so there is not much messing around getting to your room. The rooms are quite spacious and well layed out, the view over the bay was amazing, alot of ships seem to be holding there.  The Bathroom was gorgeous, the tub and separate shower where to die for and the bathroom is massive with plenty of room. could do with having light switches in the bathroom instead of out in the hallway, also would be good to have information around on how to use the electronic features.  Top floor is the amazing pool, the view is breathtaking and must do if every there.  i would advise if you know…",4,
"I actually feel sad to say it, but it should be better than it is. I love the Marina Bay Sands, and the hotel is so impressive you could be forgiven for overlooking the basic things they get wrong!   The lifts are relatively slow, especially when there are large numbers of people trying to use them at the same time. And although the aircon works fine in the rooms, it seems to be non-existent in the halls, foyers and especially the lifts - which are almost stiflingly hot!!  Overall it's still an amazing experience, and something I would recommend - I just wish they could do something about the aircon!!",3,
"Huge hotel, beautiful location, awesome amenities, great staff, just think about heaven booked a stay with this hotel, then close your eyes just wait for to reach there and it will be like you stepped i the heaven.Love this place like never wanna leave it :)",5,
"Stayed in 2 Club rooms. Rooms were great with excellent view. Bed was super comfortable. Very spacious room with ample space for the kids to run about. Service a front desk was excellent. However the same can't be said for the rest. Service standards at breakfast @ RIse needs improvement. Had requested for half-boil eggs and were served with hard-boiled eggs. When re-requested, was given the eggs with hot water. Water wasn't even hot. Eventually I got raw eggs for breakfast. Service staff at the counter wasn't of much help either. Spread for  breakfast was huge but in terms of quality : average.  Have been doing staycation the past few  years and was slightly disappointed with the service rendered at MBS.  This was my 2nd stay at MBS and sadly standards seems to have dipped. …",3,
"This is service at it's best! Phenomenal hotel, staff and service! No complaints, the rooms were fantastic, the food delicious and the cocktails to die for! I will definitely go back!!!  The location is obviously great, nothing was too much hassle for the staff.  Tip: if you're a swimmer, wake up early and get some laps in, they have a contained lap lane although some selfie addict will try to get one in while you are clocking your kms!! ",5,
"This is a hard property to review.  The amenities are top notch.  The pool is frankly awesome and the attached restaurants and shops are top shelf.  Unfortunately, the hotel experience is a bit painful.    Starting with the good.  The building is striking and has fast become the most recognizable part of the Singapore skyline.  The Infinity Pool is unlike anything I have seen.  It is on the 57th Floor of the hotel and overlooks the city.  I went just before sunrise and saw the sun come up over the city.  A memorable experience.  Also, the shoppes and casino are similar to the Venetian/Palazzo in Las Vegas (another Sands property).  Tons of high end shops, celebrity chef restaurants.  The casino is huge and has all the games you would expect.  Due to the intense security, it…",3,
"I love to swim in this hotel. Every time I stay at this hotel, I take a rest in the pool. Good exercise and good view at the same time.",5,
"Its a huge hotel.... full with people at all times......  Pro - every service provided was good.... had hiccups upon arrival but had a breeze check in till check out. Overall, a pleasant stay. Loved the view (no matter which direction your room is, one of the garden by the sands and the other of the city). Its well connected with public transport and beautiful urbanscapes. Plenty of luxury shopping outlets and restaurants. Has the best view from the infinity pool. Good security.  Con - crowded...too many people (even at the pool). had to wait at least 15 minutes to be seated for breakfast.  Enjoyed the stay with kids but if you are looking for quiet serene and a private environment...this is not for you (yup..not my cup of tea).",4,
"Stayed 2 nights at MBS. Hotel was massive. As soon you walked in to hotel lobby, you can tell how big is the hotel. Check in staff was polite and professional.  Standard room was a bit small with water view. Even though, not the best water view. We paid standard room, so what you pay what you get.   The famous infinity poll was the highlight of the hotel. The view was amazing. The pool a little bit crowded.   Overall, enjoyed the stay at MBS. Just a bit far from orchard rd. However, once you stay at MBS, you don't  need to go anywhere else. So many things to do over there. ",4,
"Had a very long stopover in Singapore so decided to treat myself and stay here for the night. At $450 AUD I was expecting quite a lot.  Check in: you need to queue - didn't have to wait too long. Maureen checked me in and she was lovely - got upgraded to higher floor (47th).  Room: average. Nothing flash, amenities were basic, shampoos etc were generic refill stuff, no luxury brands here.  Bed: average, Rydges beds are still better  View: amazing - see pics  Room service: Very expensive and not that tasty - see pics  Gym: basic equipment, treadmill, bikes, weights etc. also have a sauna. Amazing view - see pics  POOL: one word - gross. Way too many people in one space, just not pleasant. Waited until later in the evening to go in and it was still warm, crowded and there was…",2,
"i will back again for sure (wait the discount rate haha) this hotel is great service in the reception,concirge,all is great.. the wifi conection is strong,and the staff very helpfull,when i loss my key card,they make the new one for me,and without any additonal charge.. the pool view is very nicee with a singapore city view,and u can enjoy the singapore city view on the observation top deck,of course it free for guest who stay there..  if u want to go marina bay shoping mall u just go down,and they have casino at the mall..",5,
"I stayed with my wife at Marina Bay Sands in June 2016 and we had a fantastic time! This is an iconic hotel and we would definitely recommend it as a must stay when visiting Singapore.  CHECK-IN/ CHECK-OUT The hotel is big but the check-in/ check-out process was outstanding! There is a significant number of desks so we waited very little time. The process was also quick and with no issues.  ROOM We stayed in a room facing the back side of the hotel, i.e., the Gardens at the Bay. I would imagine the view to Singapore is nice but we were quite happy with ours. We could see Gardens By The Bay (especially in the evening with the light show and illuminated ""trees"") and the sea.  The room is modern, huge and the decoration is beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom…",5,
"The Marina Bay Sans is a hotel everyone Ne must stay at one in their life.  The hotel is a destination it's self and you could easy spend a few days here without leaving the hotel.   The highlight is clearly the pool and the main reason my most people stay here. Apparently the MBS's boasts the world highest infinity pool.  The rooms are a generous size, bathrooms are fantastic - super large!  One side and do the hotel has balconies (view of garden and harbour)  The gym is amazing, great equipment and stunning views from level 55  The room service menu is outstanding, but very expensive. Salad and a soup was $70+",5,
"One look at the photos of this hotel will tell you that the hotel pool is the most stunning in the world by a wide margin, all I can say is the reality is even better than the pictures, its amazing.  Well worth treating yourself for a night or two if you can afford it.  Beyond the pool, this is a large hotel with all the amenities and quality you would expect of a luxury 5 star modern hotel. The views, not just over the city, but over the harbour on the back side are spectacular. The rooms have balconies which enhances the views.  The location away from the hubs of the Orchid or Raffles area which is a minor downside, there is the subway and taxi's aren't overly expensive but its not the same as being in the thick of it.  So if your on a budget, an idea might be to treat…",5,
"We came on a work conference and I was not only surprised at how big the hotel & facilities were but also with how well they managed the numbers of customers. Very clean, large rooms with amazing views over the city. Huge bathroom with double vanity, massive bath and separate bath and shower. The pool at the top will not disappoint and is worth a night here just to swim in it! How amazing - an infinity pool looking over the city! Pool is huge and plenty of room for everyone. No complaints at all, room was super quiet even with our function outside that kicked on for hours into the night. ",5,
"An outstanding hotel and one that has changed the skyline in Singapore immeasurably. Great rooms, great facilities, gym, pool, restaurants etc. for those who have time the shopping mall in  the basement floors provides something for all. ",5,
"This hotel is a must stay if you are in Singapore if only for 1 night, but  it is over the top expensive. I stayed here 3 years ago and it was half the price then plus you were able to check in earlier and leave later, may not have the use of the room but where able to use the pool and hotel amenities. Now checkin is at 3pm and checkout is 11am, they will mind your bags for you if you arrive early. We had a deluxe room and had booked a garden view but was upgraded to city view. The room was big and had a lovely huge bathroom. Bar fridge was weighted so you couldn't put anything in it, but could ask for a small fridge to be put in.  I think at a cost. Pool was fantastic and that's the only real reason we decided it was a must do for 1 night.  Bar and food service at the pool was…",4,
"Checkin was fast and easy. Had a room in tower 3 on upper floor with sea view, great room with everything needed.  Ate at Breadstreet (Gordon Ramsay), expensive but excellent. Spent time in infinity pool, loved it.  An expensive but memorable trip.  ",5,
"My friend and I stayed here on our last night in Singapore. Our room was awesome with floor to ceiling Windows, comfy beds and a huge bathroom, it did not disappoint. We spent most of our time around the pool which wasn't too crowded an had amazing views. The food and drinks were very expensive but tasted great! The staff weren't bad but they weren't amazing either. All up I would recommend Marina Bay sands and will definitely be back hopefully for longer next time. ",4,
"We thought we would treat ourselves to Marina Bay Sands as a first stop for our holiday in Singapore. How terribly disappointing! As a 4/5 star hotel your staff are rude & uneducated. We were ""greeted"" by a rude and abrupt girl at the check in counter by a girl named Vanessa. She was unhelpful and not what you would expect from a facility that boasts itself as 5 star. Because our room wasn't ready we were given access to the infinity pool and sky park. When we reach the top we were met by another guy. We were confused about where the pool was as this was our first visit. We asked the guy and the response was the most uneducated I have ever received! Not ""pardon"" or ""sorry ma'am"" but a ""WHAT??!!"" With the most condescending look ever. I suggest you send your staff to do a course…",1,
"this of course was a must for singapore! it is well managed hotel even though so many people around. easy access by any transport with all ""must see"" close by. one night was enough for us. interesting to realize how many rich people around when you are in the pool. the pool is of course is something to remember for all your life.",5,
The property is nice but very expensive.  I would not recommend the hotel strictly based on how expensive the food and drinks are.  They take advantage of the guests.  The gym is great and staff is friendly.  It is a casino property. The pool deck is amazing. ,4,
"Stayed 2 nights and had a great time Well located, and the pool is awesome, have to enjoy it at night Gets very busy but is well worth the experience We stayed with 2 kids in the same room which worked fine. It is a big hotel so don't expect personal service, but is worth the experience ",4,
"Paid loads for this hotel because of a conference.  It is spectacular outside but the room interior is quite normal, apart from a big balcony facing the Gardens by the Bay. It depends on what you are looking for.  The rather impressive atrium has the wow factor but is quite chaotic and unpleasant space stuffed with thousands of group tourists, showing-off riches and conference attendees. You would wonder why you pay so much to this train station alike place.  Inside the room you will see rather standard 4 star hotel environment: tasteless veneers, very cheap plastic water cattle, impractical coffee table, no handy towel hanger, cheap toiletry, etc. etc.  Hotel staff are quite helpful, but again, not as professional as expected for this price..  It really surprised me as a hotel…",3,
"My grown daughter and I took the MRT from the airport and walked right off the train into the well marked corridor that led us through the shops and into the 1st Tower of the hotel.  We were awed at first sight by the architecture and decor. The staff was attentive and we had a room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. On our first night, there was a light show in the Gardens and we could open our balcony door and watch. It was amazing.The next day we could walk right from the hotel to the Gardens. The infinity pool was everything we expected.  It took us a while to realize the third section (so to speak) of the infinity pool is for adults only and we enjoyed ourselves much more with a somewhat quieter, less crowded setting.  The music played promotes a party feel which was not…",5,
"We checked into the Marina Bay Sands and were really looking forward to the experience.   I was travelling with the family and had booked a family room with a king bed and 2 shared singles for the kids.   The drama started right after we checked in. None of the 4 keys we were given opened the door. Fortunately the porter arrived with our bags to let us in. 2 staff from the hotel verified that our keys didn't work and that they would send someone with replacements. After waiting 20 minutes no one arrived, we wanted to leave the room and head to the pool. So I had to go to reception to sort out the keys myself.   Fast forward later that evening when we returned to the room from dinner there was vomit all over the elevator floor that was left behind by a reveller. No one had…",1,
"If you plan to go on a holiday trip to Singapore, just do not go to the Marina Bay Sands! Totally overpriced, totally overcrowded and a poor Management!! We are just staying here with our 2 kids and today we just wanted to sleep in the night.... No chance!! The hotel organized a party and our bed in the 54th floor is still shaking because of the noise!! If you pay more than a thousand dollars for the night you expect at least to be warned of that, so you get a chance to look for another hotel. And most probably one with a pool which is cleaner!  We will never ever return to this place, there are much better hotels in Singapore!",1,
"For sure if you go to Singapore as vacation you should stay at least one night at this hotel (or all the time if you have $$$), to enjoy the hotel facilities and infinite pool. Great staff, great service, great pool, but everything have it's price.",5,
"We stayed here 5 years ago and loved it. This time we were beyond disappointed.  Both times we stayed Club Level in the Orchid Suite. We are a family of 3 who enjoy luxury but appreciate value for money.  The rooms are big and generous but that is about where it ends. It has aged considerably, smells of smoke in a non smoking room and the club is a huge step backwards.   5 years ago we enjoyed fabulous food and drink at club level right next to the pool on level 57 without crowds.  Now club level is downgraded to level 55 in something that resembles a 2nd tier airport lounge, enclosed, tired and crowded. The hotel is now clearly a casino out to make money of the thousands traveling in from Mainland China without regard to any other traveler. The Marina Bay Sands has become the…",1,
"Apparently, this rating system from terrible to excellent does not really fit to describe a place like Marina Bay Sands. This is one of a kind and should be ranked on its own matrix I guess.  We initially stayed at Pan Pacific hotel and then moved to Marina Bay Sands mostly for the reason to experience the famous rooftop infinity pool. So the personal impressions are such: reception is like a busy railway station, zero glamour or fleur d'embiance; room is normal, room view is fantastic; the pool is like one of those many others at big family resorts, i.e. shallow, crowded, served with crisps and beers, - the difference is that this one is on the 57th floor! And it is super cool by the mere fact of its existence!",4,
For us Singapore visit wouldn't have been completed without having a swim in Infinity pool. Will I do it again? Not sure... but it must be done once. Having a cocktail while sitting by the pool and watching our kids go crazy swimming in Infinity pool was a priceless moment.  It's better value of money to stay at Club Room as you get lot of freebies including cocktail hour.,5,
"I have stayed 5 times at the Marina Bay Sands and I still love it. It is busy, extrovert and noisy and you must like that, but the views are second to none and the city view from the infinity pool is totally spectacular!",5,
"Stayed for one night, as it's quite expensive. Booked in advance to find the cheapest day of the week - mostly to experience the rooftop never ending pool! So worth it!   We had taken an over-night train from Malaysia, so this was heaven when we arrived! As we arrived early, the room wasn't ready when we arrived, but that was no problem - we were given access to the pool until the room was ready, which was what we were there for anyways!   Clean, cool and quiet room, perfect to recover from traveling, before going new places the following days exploring Singapore. Much recommended to do one night, even if you're on a budget.",5,
"From the moment we walked into the lobby to check in we were treated with top class service. From everyone at the MBS hotel, the service and hospitality was wonderful. I know the cynics will say when you are paying top dollar you should always get that type of service but that isn't always true. I couldn't question the top class service that we were treated to.   We deliberately stayed the two nights so we could have a full day at the pool, it truly didn't disappoint. What a wonderful view and how lucky are we to be treated to such luxuries. Many thanks to Daniel for going out of his way on the pool deck to ensure we were looked after. He went over and above of what any hotel guest could expect.   On our last day as we had a late night flight, we were offered complimentary use…",5,
"Well, the Marina Bay Sands and it's infinity pool are the flagships of Singapore. Experience once. When you are staying at the hotel, you can enjoy the (in)famous pool - little bit circus, but it's nice to experience once. The view & experience is nice. We had a club room, so we could also enjoy the breakfast & afternoon tea at the Skygarden, nice.  But the only time we faced service was once check in and out. In between, nobody cared were we ware & who we are - too big to handle and add the personal touch.",4,
"Me and My boyfriend visited for the weekend for our anniversary and his birthday. Upon arrival you are in awe of the property. It's so beautiful and grande inside. Check in line was a bit long even for early check in. The staff was sweet enough to upgrade us to a suite on the 53rd floor. I was SO happy they did because the views were to die for!! You walk in and the curtains automatically open to the panormaic infamous marina bay views. Everything was clean, the bathroom was huge and king bed was comfortable. We went to the pool on the 57th floor and holy!! This is why people really go to the Marina Bay sands which is still fairy new (5 years old). The staff upstairs are really amazing too- waiters/waitresses who run in the heat delivering drinks and hot food. We had a few…",5,
singapore always has awesome place. I love photography and this place good enough to taking picture ;) The people and the staff really welcoming. They know how to treat another with smile and gesture. Little bit hot around here.,5,
"Due to all the hype around the hotel and infinity pool I just had to experience it. And what an experience it was.   From the moment you arrive in front if the hotel and the moment when you exit the hotel you can put your brain to rest and let the hotel staff take care of everything. Awsome service, amazing views and the pool!!!  Tip of advice:  - ask for early check-in to avoid all the new guests with the standard check in.  - Avoid going to the infinity pool from 4 to 7pm as it is fully packed with people.  - If you plan to go to one of the restaurants in the hotel area book ahead of time as usually they are sold out for 1 day in advance.  Last but not least, try to keep track of expenses, money flies when you're in the hotel area, but still worth every penny. ",5,
"The hotel is really big. The money you spend , i guess it worthed.  If you want to eat, go to the shoppes. Mall next to it. And try to find foodcourt, much cheaper than hotel resto. The swimming pool awesome. My kids really happy and exciting. The staff very helpfull, they kept smiling and explaining to us what we asked  Thanx so much. One...thing... the check out time, really fast. We wish we can check out around 2pm o'clock. ",4,
"i am a member here at this hotel. I check in myself for a night staycation every quarter. a good place with many eatries from low range to expensive fine dining. the pool is super packed with selfies tourists, but it is still a nice place to chill with the right vibe.",5,
"if you have time and you want to spend in quality mood. then stay there. nice place, expensive but worth it. food was good too. friendly staff. sea view was fantastic. bedroom was perfect. i would like to go again.",5,
"What can I say? Unforgettable stay. The hotel (as the whole city) is designed to wow. But not to wow in a Dubai way (some people may not like Dubai way) but in the way that can give you goose bumps.  From the moment you step into the lobby, everything is interesting. The engineering behind this hotel is mesmerizing. I nearly injured my neck looking around as we queued for the check-in. If you like that kind of thing, check the construction documentary on youtube - makes you appreciate this project even more. Note how each tower is essentially two towers leaning against each other. Fascinating.  We got a bay view Deluxe room on the 39th floor. Super spacious, modern, comfortable and well equipped with everything you could possibly think of.  Infinity rooftop pool is not…",5,
"We stayed for two nights, mainly to experience the infinity pool and to be within walking distance of Gardens by the Bay.  Being in the pool was amazing, but when you are from Australia, you are used to pools where you can actually swim, rather than just wade past other guests taking selfies.  Even at dawn, when the pool opened, it was jam-packed full of people.  We are really pleased we experienced the hotel (which is beautiful) and now we have ticked the pool off our bucket list.  It's an incredible place; the views are spectacular, but the size of the hotel makes it an experience akin to Christmas shopping - people everywhere and miles to walk to get anything you need.",4,
"We couldn't resist blowing out our travel budget for at least just one night to stay at this amazing, opulent, marvel of a hotel.  Upon entering, you'll be taken-a-back by the spacious and beautiful lobby that soars upward.  There are tons of people milling about taking pictures and admiring this beautiful marvel of a hotel. Restaurants and a lounge occupy the lobby among shops.  The staff at the Marina Bay Sands is very friendly and accommodating - I don't think there is a language that the staff doesn't speak.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, modern, plenty of details and amenities, all offering amazing views of the city and or the ocean.  Of course, the most amazing part of the Marina Bay Sands is the infinity pool which spans the three towers some 57 stories up and offers…",5,
"We walked into the hotel going ""wow"". Just the architecture of the hotel itself was mesmerizing both from the outside and inside -- we stood there in awe for a few seconds raising our heads inside the lobby just admiring the structure. It was a brilliant hotel at many aspects and I have no complaints - the rooms were clean and bright, beds were spotless, bathroom spacious, even the sink was memorably nice. But the hotel was a little too massive for my taste - every time you arrive the lobby you come upon a flock of 200 people in your face. It was like being in a huge crowded shopping mall in Hong Kong. There were crowds everywhere - at the breakfast restaurant, at the infinity pool (which was, undeniably, breathtaking but then again it was too crowded you could hardly move…",4,
"When visiting Singapore, one may book a single night at the MBS, in order to enjoy the infinity pool. Everything else is substandard (extremely crowded, noisy, long queues for checkin, breakfast, information, waiting for a taxi in the evening, etc.) For the rest of your stay go to the Shangrila or the Ritz ... you will get proper Asian service and confort at a better price ... and NEVER for a business trip",2,
"Book a weekend staycation at MBS Premier room with balcony facing Gardens by the Bay. Valet parking was perfect & the guest overnight parking charges were reasonable for that MBS area. Was ushered to the VIP check-in area & process was done within 10-15mins. The lobby area was packed with tourist, guests & people, understandable because this is a huge hotel. Given a mid level room at tower 1, accessible only tapping the room card in the lift control panel for security. Room size is good, room is well maintained & clean. Balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay & distance seaview. Bathroom is quite big with the bath area, toilet bowl & sink all separated . Bed & pillow is too soft for our liking... we prefer firmer ones. Swimming pool on level 57 was crowded but this seems to…",3,
"The Marina Bay Sands is a Singapore  landmark. The architecture and the infinity pool on the 57th floor are spectacular. However, is this the best hotel in Singapore: probably not.  The Marina Bay Sands has taken the philosophy of the Venetian in Vegas and has transposed it in Singapore: themed restaurants (some of which are pretty good), shopping areas, lots of guests and plenty of possibilities to spend money...  Some of the pricing is a tad excessive, then again this is Singapore and the view from the open area restaurants, pool, bar & club are superb.",4,
"Large scale and super impressive. Hotel ,shopping options, casino and restaurants all top notch and can cater for big numbers of people without feeling too crowded  I enjoyed the gym at the hotel and the pool view is amazing Seafood at the hotel buffet was perfect - large range of hot and cold options",4,
"When we have checked in 4 hours late, we were taken by surprise and over whelmed, when we were offered an upgraded premium room & late check-out facility as a goodwill gesture.  Great views, one of the wonders of civil engineering, excellent facilities, prompt & quick service, very friendly staff and all in all a wonderful & pleasant experience. Love to visit again.",5,
To be honest this hotel is not worth the money.  We arrived very late as our flight was delayed. We had pre-booked a family room via our travel agent in Aus. When we got to our room there were 2 king single beds- for four of us!!!!I had to call the reception twice to get 2 rollaways sent. I think they seriously thought 4 people would fit there in the single beds!!  I thought I had booked a room with 2 queen beds. Warning - they DON'T have rooms with 2 queen beds!!! At 2 am it was only when I lost my cool that they sent the 2nd rollaway. Initially they thought 2 kids would share a rollaway???? On what planet? So we calmed ourselves with a $15 beer from the mini bar and all slept in our single beds..... The breakfast buffet was very good and of exceptional quality. The pool is…,4,
its humangus hotel totally commercial property with awesome pool at the terrace .  we stayed in room #1866 . the view from room window was just awesome . we can see the super tree evening light show right from our room . the view is complete garden by the bay from our room . pool was very nice but since we visited in june it was raining heavily and water in the pool was pretty cold .,5,
"The pool is just stunning. The view from the room is fascinating and probably one of the best in the city. The hotel is very big and doesn't feel crowded. The room is beautiful, perfect bathroom with all amenities. Definitely will come back to this hotel.",4,
"Marina Bay sands is an iconic building in Singapore with nice view from all the rooms,  you can get better rooms for the same price in other hotels but swimming in the infinity pools is a must in Singapore",4,
"We had an amazing time staying here! It was our honeymoon and they very kindly upgraded us to one of the suites - these rooms are incredible with a large separate reception area, beautiful bathroom and a sweeping balcony with views over the city. The staff were super friendly and made us feel very special :)  The infinity pool is a key feature of this hotel and certainly doesn't disappoint - amazing views over the city (get your cameras ready)! The service by the pool was of a high standard and the food portions excellent! I also made use of the gym facilities which were good (and with great views over the city).  When considering the size of this hotel (2000 plus rooms), I imagine it isn't for everyone (quite hectic in the main foyer), but nonetheless, I would strongly…",5,
"We stayed on the 39th floor, tower 3 with the city view and it was just worth the price we paid. The room was big, spacious and so was the bathroom. The in room dining menu was well priced. The staff was incredible!  We went to the infinity pool at around 6.30 pm, though crowded ( we weren't photobombed at all; there is room for everyone) we easily found 2 loungers right by the pool. The skywalk area on tower 3 (free for guests, paid otherwise) provided a wide view which was spectacular.",5,
"* The Service - it doesn't get any better. We were upgraded to a club room (from 39 sqm to 86 sqm) on our arrival just because we answered ""yes"" when asked ""Is this your first time in Singapore?"". Two hours later we come back to the room and there's a complimentary bottle of Australian shiraz cabernet on the table. * The Room - really nice, but not the wow factor. I've seen better rooms and paid less (the wow factor is the bathroom though, almost as big as the room, Cavalli products and stuff)  * The Pool - on my bucket list since its construction in 2010. Breathtaking at night. Crowded. Enemy number 1 of the free space left on my sd card.",4,
"This hotel is one of the iconic building in Singapore (3 ultra modern high rise building). I stayed in 50th floor of the hotel, so the night view of Singapore from the hotel was really awesome. If you are staying in the hotel, you must go to the infinity pool which is on the top (57th floor). Infinity pool is just amazing. Its worth trying your luck in the casino too which is in the hotel premise.",5,
"Hotel is amazing, we arrived a little after 1pm, and they allowed us to check in straight away, so a massive bonus not having to queue for ages as others have mentioned. We were allocated a room in Tower 3, on the 49th floor overlooking the Gardens by the bay, and the bonus of having a balcony was great to!   Room was spotless, and modern to, we had a lovely big bed and walk in shower.   The infinity pool was the only reason we came here, and oh wow was it worth it! Checking in that little bit earlier was worth it also as we beat a lot of the crowd, who checked in later. It got really busy around 4, and you would have struggled for a lounger after then. The pool is open until 11, so after dinner we went back up to enjoy Singapore at night laid out in front of us.  We had…",5,
"I couldn't wait to try out the pool on the top of the hotel and I wasn't unhappy.  The views were spectacular and although the photos I had seen made the pool look bigger, it was lacking nothing, I loved it.   The room was as you would expect for a 5 star, fantastic and I cannot find anything negative to say.  Food was first class and the staff to match it. Can't wait to go back.",5,
"A short visit to Marina Bay on out way to Bali was a great experience. We have been to Singa seven years ago when it was under construction and curious about the resort. Check-in was fast and early, we arrived around 11 am -advice: take the taxi from airport- afordable and quite fast. The room was very nice, 39th floor, booked through Marina Bay website, every 5* needed. The pool was fine, not too crowdy and the service and food very good. The Marina Bay reward card must to be done before check-out, in order to gain somme spaindable points. Nice shopping mall, good restaurants around. Very much liked the Gardens by the Bay and evening infinity pool swimming. Take an upper room, the wiew over the bay is wonderful :-)",4,
"We recently spent 5 nights (family of 5) at the Marina Bay and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and service.  I'm always worried about these big hotels and the fact you are just a number but they manage to out service you in every aspect.  The rooms are great, the choice of restaurents is awesome and the pool is something you must do.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to go back.",5,
"Stayed for two night when we passed through Singapore.  Good things first, amazing infinity pool (one of the main reasons we wanted to give it a go at staying here) - is can get freezing in the evenings! Rooms are modern with good views, breakfast selection is plentiful and decent in quality.  Being a large hotel, service is just OK - with this many guests and rooms hard to be consistent and personable, wait at check in can be long.   Sometimes overwhelmingly busy with so many people and tourist passing through, so you can never feel that relaxed. Location is OK, if you want convenience and personal touch service probably look elsewhere. We also stayed two days at Raffles which definitely felt more comfortable.",3,
"This hotel is just AMAZING, you have to stay here at least one night while in Singapore.  Yes, it is very pricey but the view of that infinity pool pays for it.   Overall the hotel is like any other hotel but their view is just AMAZING, the staff is very friendly and cooperative.   And that pool, man that pool although as everything is Asia it is very crowded you dint really feel like this because is very big, something i like is the divide the pool in 2 sections, one for people under 18 and one for over 18 which is very nice( although i love kids it is not really nice to have them jumping around you in the pool while you are trying to relax ).  To avoid crowd go at around 10 - to 3 because this is the check out (11 am) and check in (3pm) time so a lot of people would not be…",5,
"Stayed one night in a deluxe club room and we were not disappointed.  The staff member who checked us in was absolutely great!  She made check in quick and seamless.  We arrived a little early (before the normal check in time) but she was able to check us in upon arrival so we could the enjoy the hotels awesome amenities!  We stayed in Tower 2 overlooking the Gardens by the Bay from the 46th Floor.  Although this is not the coveted city view, we really enjoyed the Garden View.  At night the Garden lights up and in the morning you can see all the ships coming into the Marina.  The rooms are huge and staying in a Club room offered a few amenities that we believe would be the reason we come back to this hotel in the future.  Breakfast, Afternoon Tea and Cocktails are available…",5,
"Booked our 3 nights stay in this hotel, one reason is to experience their famous infinity pool. But we were disappointed because the pool was too crowded and not that clean anymore. Service was okay, and we're satisfied with their free breakfast. Rates are expensive though.",3,
"We had a 2 night stop over in Jan 2015 on our honeymoon. This place is incredible! The rooms were very modern & spacious. We had a Deluxe Bay View room which was great. The breakfast was yummy with a great variety. The infinity pool is the highlight. The most amazing view! Highly recommend staying here just so you can use the pool, there is no where else like it. ",5,
"I did not stay at the hotel on this occasion but did visit its bar and pool on the top floor.   All I can say is ""Amazing"". Incredible view of almost all of Singapore. Really worth going to.  I will be back in Singapore next week and, this time, will be staying at the hotel.",4,
"I visited this city back on April 2014, the most impressive city I have seen, clean, people respectful and life level out of this world. This hotel is a must to visit, the city view at the top of Marina is wonderful, consider to have with you some dollar to buy a beer.",5,
"We stayed here on our honeymoon in June 2016 and were pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade to a Grand Club Suite. All the staff were very helpful and professional during our check-in and check-out process.  The room itself was incredible and total luxury, with plenty of space and lots of lovely details, including an excellent coffee machine. We were on the 4th floor had a lovely view of Gardens by the Bay so could watch the light show in the evening.   However, being so low down, the noise from the expressway right outside was awful, we were a bit jetlagged after flying and just couldn't sleep for the noise. We had a look at the sliding doors and think they weren't quite shut properly, but they were bolted down so we couldn't do anything. This put a bit of a downer on what was…",4,
"We stayed in one of the club rooms and would recommend it.  The accommodation included breakfast and happy hour in the restaurant on the Skypark floor.  The views are fantastic, especially over the gardens and the cruise terminal.  The rooms are fantastic and the check in, check out is really efficient.",5,
"I booked the hotel for my family trip last week Raya holiday, and I found that we are disappointed that the hotel service is not up the standard that we usually travel too. Firstly, when we reach the hotel, the queue was long, and I saw guest are squatting beside the wall waiting for their parents to get hold of their room key. I wonder why can't they just replace one of the retail shops with waiting lounge just in front of the receptionist counter and serve their guest in a more prudent way since they are paying a premium price, to begin with. Without it, the whole environment seems like a tourist market area.   The most troublesome that we had was the room's toilet which they don't provide the handheld shower, where it's almost impossible for a 2-year-old child to take a…",2,
"So this place isn't cheap but the experience of swimming in their infinity pool 57 floors high was so worth it.  We had a family suite and although we arrived before official check-in time, the lady at reception kindly gave us temporary access to the pool whilst we waited for our room.  Watching the sunset and then the city lights come on, all from the luxury of the pool was just sensational.  You can also go to the other side of the pool deck to see Marina Bay Gardens light up at night. Marina Bay Sands is extremely busy so if you want peace and tranquillity, this probably isn't for you. But if you want to swim in one of the world's top 10 infinity pools with luxury all around you, then this hotel is for you.  Walk through to top end shops, enjoy the ""Wonder Full"" light and…",5,
"This is a lovely luxury hotel.  Great access to the MRT and has all the modern convenience that you would expect.  Our room was very large and comfortable and easily fitted the four of us.  We loved our stay but wouldn't probably stay here with small children, teenagers are fine.  Lovely restaurants inside, wasn't overly fussed one the Shoppes but overall this is a beautiful hotel.",5,
"Singapore is a must for any family who want to explore, a very safe & very clean country. The hotel is absolutely amazing, we stayed in a suite & were truly spoilt!  The club level access was wonderful for choice of foods & the staff were very attentive.  The pool is stunning & enjoyed incredible views over Singapore. Eating out is very expensive, shopping is incredible!   Sentosa resorts world is a must for families, we enjoyed universal, the beaches & many parks available there. ",5,
"If you like the idea of being on a large luxury cruise ship but would prefer not to brave the high seas then this is the perfect place for you!  For everyone else, it is an experience but definitely not something I would want to do for more than two nights as it is, as another reviewer commented 'exhausting'!  Guests have to be okay with so many people everywhere, all of the time (both hotel guests and tourists).  Rooms are very quiet and comfortable and staff are smiley for the most part and as attentive as you can ever be given the volume of guests. The pool area is breathtaking but snapping a shot without milling throngs of people getting in the way proved almost impossible.  Tip:  Don't think you'll beat the masses by getting up at dawn, we tried it and it was Las Vegas…",4,
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights, the room was great and we were on the 48th floor with a city view which was amazing. We ordered room service once which was also pretty good but it took around 1.30 minutes. We visited the pool a few times which was splendid but a little crowded. We also visited the viewing platform which had amazing views. The restaurants at the hotel were nice but a little pretentious and overpriced for small portions. On check out I paid for the room, what I hadn't realised is that that they also held the money for the room that was deposited on check in for 2 weeks after you check out. The deposit was the cost of the room, so I got a call from my bank because it looked like the same transaction was attempting to go through twice. The Marina…",3,
"My family and I stayed here for 2 nights in July 2016. We were on the 42nd floor overlooking the gardens, which was an amazing view. The rooms are lovely and the infinity pool is from out of this world... wow!!!",5,
"Rooms was fine, service was great. The roof top pool was a different experience, great to see the views, however, the pool felt like a bit of a human soup with so many other tourists in it too.    We dined at Ce La Vie roof-top restaurant with our two children. The bill was $500 and was not worth half that! Food was only acerage. Very overpriced.  Our son did get sick when we arrived at the hotel from Thailand, and the staff were very helpful with arranging a doctor.  It was an nice experience, however we would not stay there again.  Once was enough.",4,
Stayed here for a week and enjoyed every minute of being at the hotel. Incredible service and food and staff.  Lost a star for pricing because your average person won't be able to afford staying here to enjoy how amazing it is and I think they should find a way to offer a special.  Received a room with a balcony and had a view of the electronic trees with a concert playing there several nights.  Infinity pool was nice to see though I didn't go in it.  Hotel is rather large but easy to get around.  Would definitely stay here again.,4,
"overtime we are in singapore, we stay at the marina bay sands hotel. this hotel has everything from really good food to clubs and theatres. walking distance to city hall as well. service is top notch with express check in. the rooms are huge with nice finishing and a nice toilet.",5,
"I love the picture perfect advertisement of the Sands.  That's why I had my big familiy gathering there last year.   You have three restaurants to choose from just for breakfast.  Everything is Grand but beware.   It is really tiring to walk those long corridors to the lift, especially if you have aging relatives.   The pool is nothing like the ads.  By 8am it is packed like a chinese railroad station.   The same at night.   People would jump in with T shirts on just to take photos.   I questioned the quality of the pool water.   The best restaurant for breakfast is upstairs next to the pool, a smaller venue, not the grand cafe in the lobby where three hundred people go.    The rooms are huge and so are everything else.  It reminds me of the hotels in Las Vegas where you have to…",4,
"My partner and I booked 3 nights as we were visiting Singapore for the first time and really wanted to experience the best of Singapore and enjoy the last days of our 6 month Asia trip. Overall impression? Great design and interesting place, worth staying at least once to say you've been there, but wouldn't come back for a repeat stay and here's why:   We wanted to book a nice room with a double bed and breakfast and pay for everything in advance so we could just focus on sightseeing and being out and about. Tried booking through the website directly but it was very confusing with many options available and not much information on what's actually included in the package (found out later that it's because you pay for every single turn you make there and the final bill is rather…",3,
"A friend was visiting so I used it as an opportunity to treat us to a night's stay at MBS (it wouldn't be as much fun by myself). At check in we were asked if it was a special occasion and I said it was an early birthday treat, so he gave us a late check out (12:30 instead of 11) and later a delicious chocolate cake was delivered with a note wishing me a happy early birthday. So it's worth having a reason to celebrate there! The pool was, as expected, very busy after check in. We were in tower 3 which was conveniently the end of the adult only section (which the lifeguards rigidly policed). It was even quite busy at about 7:30am when we went up hoping to get a good spot for the morning (we did manage it, but there was a lot of people with selfie-sticks already in the pool).  The…",5,
"This place isn't cheap but you get what you pay for!   The room is huge and has everything and more for what you need.   And the pool! Like most, this was the reason we stayed and were equally impressed with the infinity pool and views of the city - highlight of our Singapore trip by a mile.  At the pool we ordered burgers and cocktails and have to say thought the prices were good considering the luxury location.   All in all I would say if you can afford you MUST stay here.    ",5,
"The room had a good view but wasn't anything special. Couldn't use the fridge to keep drinks cool($10 charge), couldn't use the toilet without needing to get someone up to unblock it, couldn't turn the temperature in the shower down(was far too hot), has no control over opening and closing the curtains, no chairs on balcony. Amazing views from the skypark but far too over crowded! All in all far too expensive for what you get given!",3,
"Though Marina Bay Sands may seem like an iconic hotel in Singapore, it is not particularly great. We had trouble with the staff there and the value of the hotel is simply terrible.  It took more than half an hour for the line to the check-in, and out party was told that we had rooms on different towers because they could not find us rooms. There are so many people in the hotel lobby, some visitors, so it seems more like a busy airport than a quality hotel.  Rooms were quite large and it had a big glass screen for you to look outside, however, they have some block of concrete with plants that straight up blocks your view.  I did not find the staff members particularly friendly nor responsible. When I was heading up to my room, there were two staffers talking in the hallway, and…",2,
Great place to stay. Shall surely go back once again during the Formula 1 Grand Prix. The infinity pool is something to look out for. But its a bit too crowded. Apart from that its a great place to stay.,4,
"My partner chose to stay at Marina Bay Sands for the experience. It was an okay stay, but not overly memorable for such an 'iconic' hotel.  Pros: The room was clean. The staff were friendly and helpful with making attraction bookings. Housekeeping always made an effort with the presentation of the room each day, which was appreciated. The shower was large and spacious. The view of Garden's by the Bay was nice. Having a large shopping complex and access to the subway underneath the hotel was handy.  Cons: The price: this hotel is overpriced for the quality. Stayed at better 4 star hotels in Singapore, so not sure why this one received 5?! It's quite dated. The elevator system is confusing and annoying. If you're staying below the 22nd floor (like we were) you need to switch…",4,
"Definately a must-do when in Singapore. The MBS is huge - however, this is not a bad thing as the hotel is very well organized and all administrative processes are highly efficient. After our arrival our luggage was taken care of immediately and as the check-in counter was quite busy we were transfered to the VIP check-in. After around 5 minutes we could go to our room. We stayed in a premier room with city view, which has a much nicer bathroom than the deluxe room and is also larger. On the 57th Floor you can find the popular infinity pool which we could not fully enjoy, as it get's very crowdy through the whole day (worse during afternoon and evening times). However, the amazing view compensates for that issue - I guess it's one of the world's greatest sights.   Check-out was…",5,
"Its hard to give the property a 5 star rating when it is so huge.  It just lacks some soul.  Do it once but choose another place next time round.  Infinity pool is the highlight.  Food was average, given the list of international chefs",4,
"I could only afford two nights but the resort and experience was fantastic. Check in was busy but moved quickly. The room was clean and spacious with spectacular views. The highlight was certainly the skypark. The pool and the service was amazing and the adults only pool well policed, making for a very relaxing time. The breakfast was expensive but a huge selection for all tastes. The only issue was the shower in the room. The water pressure was quite poor and was more reminiscent of a more budget hotel. Only a tiny glitch on a very memorable experience!",5,
"Stayed 4 to 7 July. Booked through hotel website.  Right thumb was bitten the evening we checked in, while on the sofa-pullout bed. 3 days later it's still swollen and now stiff, the skin rough. Guest Service would only say the room is cleaned after each guest checked out and pest control was done regularly. Which likely means once a year, or every 6 months if the guests are lucky. Obviously I'm not the lucky one. Zero service recovery.  Hotel has no in-house clinic. Which is extremely short-sighted of the management not to have a medical team on standby. A doctor's service costs $350 to $200 depending on the time of day or night.   Fruit tray appeared in the evening after, not when, we checked in. An obvious disconnect between Front Office, Housekeeping and Food service. A…",3,
My experience at Marina Bay Sands was absolutely incredible. The decor and atmosphere is unbeatable. Easily one of the best hotels I've been to. Great hospitality and quality room with an amazing view. The infinity pool was incredible as well. I can't wait to go back next year with my family.,5,
"So Marina Bay Sands is Iconic.   We had a room on a high floor, city views and tower 3 (we heard that was the best tower).  Rooms are very spacious and clean - loved the bathroom.  Nice big double sinks and the shower was incredible.   The pool speaks for itself, we've all seen pictures - it's even more incredible in person.  One thing I love is there is an adult only section on the basically 3 sections of pools.  The lifeguards were all over it too.  No one with children could sit in the adult only section.   The gym is amazing.  Great equipment - great views.  Went everyday and ""lost myself"" in the gym which is unusual for hotel gyms.   There are an endless number of great restaurants.  It's actually impressive how many great restaurants there are.  You will eat very well…",4,
"Mega hotel with most beautiful swiming pool in the world, all kinds of restaurants . giant shopping mall with luxury brands and of course casino and all in one place - recommended for those who visits Singapore",5,
Stayed in a room facing the park and was pleasantly surprised that it had a balcony. Facilities were top notch and I spent a lot of time gawking at the effort that went into building the place as there is so much detail to see. The roof top pool has amazing views but especially great at night as I found it to be surreal to be able to swim there in the evening and admire the sunset and city skyline. Bring your selfie stick as you will be needing it!  The staff were attentive and responsive. Checkin was smooth and a booking mistake was easily sorted out. I will definitely come again.,5,
"The first big disappointment was the very long waiting time to check in - 45 min - due to the mass of people. I dont understand why such a big  a hotel cannot handle many people checking in at the same time. Furthermore everybody who checked in spent quite a long time at the desk - seems to be complicated. The next disappointment was the room itself - I booked a room for 3 adults, and it was actually a room with 2 large bed, not king or queen size. And when I asked for another room I've been told that they still cleaning it - note that check in is 3pm and I asked at 3.45pm. How comes in this large hotel they still cleaning it or do not have any other rooms for 3 person. Check out is by the way 11am - all in all much shorter stay than in other hotels. Furthermore everything in…",2,
"The name ""Marina Bay Sands"" stands an impression of grande luxury hotel and stay but all were just frame of mind and not in real. While getting the checkin to the hotel was just a pain in *** (hope you got) Waited and struggled to get to checkin counter and got a checkin after waiting in a queue for 1h10min to be precise which was just pathetic experience  Upon checkin the room status was fantastic with welcoming with auto operating curtain feels you about the luxurious stay! The bathroom and bed linen were fantastically made up with a locker safe, fridge (mini bar), pair of bath robe and bla bla gosh forgot about the bible to pray during your stay for better service! (The staff is generally generous and helpful but service uptime was too poor, cleaning of bed linen requested…",4,
"wow, where do I start, Ok, we booked a Grand Club room, 42 floors up, City view, 4 nights at aprox £1,500.00 Not cheap, but it comes with everything, even your own Butler (if you want this). V.I.P. booking in.  (no waiting around) Also breakfast, which caters for all tastes, & eggs freshly cooked any which way you like. If you want breakfast in bed, thats no problem. You have access to Club 55, which is situated in the second tower, beverages anytime, afternoon tea with cakes ect, evening orderves ect. All included. You could manage quite easily with all this ,without spending money on eating out at all.

"Booked a room facing the city, the size of the room was good, with a very spacious bathroom and separate bathtub.  Everything about the room was reasonable good, the space, the ceiling height, the light, the bathroom, etc.  The swimming pool on the sky park is good, but water is often very cold, its more of a for viewing purpose and its often so crowded, its impossible for you to swim without kicking somebody or get kicked.  Been here a few times but its still a big disappointment that they do not have a proper lobby with sofa and spacious areas to rest and enjoy a drink. Service of the staffs are often slow, its the biggest hotel in Singapore so yea many rooms and guests, but its not an excuse for slower and poor service standards.",4,
Last review I wrote for MBS was  not particularly favourable. So it's only fair I update on my most recent stay.  Whatever has happened between last year and now has only been a good thing.    Our check in officer whose name I didn't get was absolutely fabulous. She accomodated our request for an adjoining room with friends who were travelling with us. She also offered us a check out of one hour later than usual.  Our room was immaculately made up everyday and we came back to an Elephant towel one afternoon which was a pleasant surprise.  The pool staff were fantastic. Their service was brilliant- they constantly made sure we were right with food and drinks and old towels were removed quickly. The lifeguards were also very efficient at removing children from the adults pool. …,5,
I m staying in this hotel from 3rd july to 5 th july   What i wanna say that if you wanna visit singapore and having a good budget than to stay in Marina Bay Sands only   1 stop all solution / Club / Pool / Casino / Shopping / many more   Best of Best place   Infinity pool at 57 floor with panoramic city view ,5,
"We booked into an Orchid Suite. The room is enormous & luxurious. Service the best. We have eaten in several of the  restaurants for breakfast & dinner & they are all great for both quality & service. I can't find anything to complain about, which is unusual for me!! Well done to all of the staff, from room service to management. Thanks for a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back.  ",5,
"Honestly I don't really like the style of this hotel - it's quite luxurious with good view BUT at the same time it is too traditional to me. I don't think young travelers will like this style as well. And the whole hotel is packed with mainlanders which made the whole atmosphere quite stressful. Front Desk staff is nice, friendly and helpful though. My room is very spacious with stunning city view. But the room is so big that I started questioning myself how come the bathroom does not have bath tub but only a shower place. The shower is disappointingly weak which I would never expect this happening in a luxury hotel in Singapore. Breakfast is awesome thou with friendly staff and various choices, Enjoyed the pool twince - once at night and once in the other morning - really quite…",3,
"Spending here a night just took my breath away.  Amazing bedrooms, with a huge amount of space that gives you a sensation of being in a palace.  All the hotel environment is really clean and modern with a lot of different places where you can enjoy and have an amazing stay.  Nearby everything you need in 2 minutes walk.  Not forgetting to mention the Skypark with the unbelievable infinity pool, jacuzzi, restaurant.. etc.  Totally recommend spending here a weekend, you will really enjoy.",5,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands at the last day of our Singapore trip for our son's spring break. We enjoyed every bit of our stay. View from SkyPark was extraordinary, it is the highest buliding in the area!  We enjoyed the brunch buffet, it had all kinds of cuisines. Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Italian it was all good.. We went back to the room happy.  The infinity pool was ok.. A bit too crowded. What can you do, everybody wants to experience swimming 57 floors above!  Overall Marina Bay Sands is a good experience. ",4,
About the pool no more words to say. Just breathtaking!  a perfect hotel which fits perfectly into the very clinical and plastic environment. Everything is well organized and superb equipped. On the other side it's perfection allows no space for individualism. It seems to be made for selfie taking robots. ,4,
Without any doubt this hotel is the Best choice to stay in singapore. This is Just because  you can admire the Best views of the city inside their infinity pool. The rooms are clean and real comfy and the service is excellent. I would not choose any other hotel if i come back.,5,
Stayed here for 2 days & all I can say is WOW! Stayed in a Premier garden view room & it was spacious & comfortable. We were lucky to be able to check in early & headed straight to the infinity pool on the 57th floor. WOW WOW WOW I don't know how else to describe the pool & the view/experience. You must do this - yes it's expensive but it's amazing & worth it. The staff were all friendly & very special mention to all the pool staff who organised a special birthday drink for me with a signed card from all the pool staff when they found out I was on a birthday holiday. I also got a very delicious bday cake in the room. We dined at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen & also Spago by Wolfgang Puck. The food & service was great but both meals were super expensive which was to be…,5,
"Marina sands bay is a landmark in Singapore with the rooftop pool overviewing the city. This hotel has everything, several restaurants, close to several touristic spots and next to an amazing shopping mall. It's a must to visit the hotel when visiting Singapore. However this is not an hotel that's giving you that personal touch what you expect from a 5 star landmark hotel it is good but I missed the hospitality and warm welcome feeling",4,
"Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an integrated resort totaling 20 hectares of land which includes the hotel, shopping, a casino, and much, much more, located along the shore of Singapore’s  Marina Bay.  The developers, Las Vegas Sands, states that this is world's most expensive standalone casino property totaling about $8 billion Singapore dollars!  When it was completed, it was the world's largest atrium casino with 500 tables and 1,600 slot machines.

This hotel is not five star in the true sense, but still a pleasant representation of hospitality.  We were walked to our room (which they really do need to do the first time, as this place is huge).  The lobby area has different areas to check in, and various boutique stores, along with the hotel gift shop.  There are escalators to lead to the mall connected to the hotel.  Upscale stores with a food court at the end of the mall.  For quick items, there is a Seven Eleven in the first corner, exiting from the hotel to the Mall.

Rooms are average, lobby, reception nd breakfast area is always so crowded that u will feel that u r in a Metro station or in a airport... Shopping arcade is impressive but its impressive every where in singapore, Overall its not worth the cost... nd absolutely not if u want to relax or want some privacy... ",3,

"From the sky deck to the infinity pool to the great rooms and awesome service, this hotel was well worth it. Everyone was very nice and helpful, we got drinks and food served to us by the pool, and any questions we had they pretty much make you feel like the most important customer. There is so much to do at the hotel and around the hotel we never left the area, and had an amazing time. Can't wait to be back ",5,
"Beyond any doubt, This is the best hotel i have stayed in the Asian region so far!   To start with the staff is extremely soft spoken, helpful and courteous. Even the bell boy was so welcoming and told us everything about the hotel and in 2 mins summarized the detailed information about the hotel.  The center of the attraction (i should rather say TOP of the attraction) is the infinity pool. It is just beyond human imagination as to how a marvel like this can even exist! I was hardly in my room, rather was chilling at the pool all the time! Do not miss the lavish Jacuzzi behind the infinity. This explains my title!   Lastly the exotic food completes the completeness of this property! I will definitely be visiting the property again for sure!",5,
The quality of the hotel is superb. The facilities are ample and I can bet you have no way to visit each and everyone of them. Location is very convenient and accessible by MRT that is located exactly at the hotel. The view of the pool on the 57th floor is to kill for. Fantastic pool. Casino is packed with people mainly china mainland visitors. That said the hotel even though in my opinion is 6 stars but at times the standards can be affected by poorly behaved visitors. They can be very loud and inconsiderate. My experience was hearing their loud chatting noise next to my room until 3am. Security was called but it continued afterwards. I guess the hotel management had to balance between the comfort of their guest and business derived from these inconsiderate behavior. So next…,5,
"Stunning - words can't explain how fabulous this hotel was! We were upgraded to a club room with spectacular view, after arriving after a night flight at 8 am - we were give our room. Everything was perfect. The staff in the club lounge were amazing, they brought a cake out for my husband and we hadn't even told them it was his birthday. Perfect in every way, there was nothing missing - all needs were met. Amazing views over the Marina. Completely faultless and will be sure to return next time we are in Singapore. Best hotel I've ever stayed in! ",5,
Massive looking building with amazing views over Singapore. Fast lift from ground floor to level 56 very fast. Huge mega name brand shops close by. Shopholics heaven if you are cashed up. Worth SGD 23 per adult for the view. Plus for only SGD 60 you can buy a souvenir picture with leather frame for posterity 😂.,5,
"You get what you pay for, a fancy pool full of arrogant selfie hunting guests! Very overcrowded hotel however it's fully expected with the amount of rooms and it's unique feature.It's hard not to recommend it as it is stunning and worth a short trip. The food and drink portions and good and tasty however you're only going for the pool as there are much nicer places to eat and drink. It's a upper class kids playground really, with people running riot and the standards slipping as the day goes on. We were lucky enough to get a free upgrade and I can only thank the staff for that. We paid a deposit of the price of the room, which I expected the the balance to be taken out of on checkout. However my card got charged twice! Quite surprising of a hotel of this stature, sent an email…",3,

The location is great, rooms are nice with fantastic views, and the casino/shopping mall on the lower floors are INCREDIBLE! The infinity pool is definitely the main attraction though ... Best rooftop pool I've been to and great for pictures ",5,
When you star at a hotel of this class you expect everything to be about perfect. and this is not to sats that the marina bay is a bad hotel but there is nothing extraordinary about the place. its a big hotel with a lot of rooms but it has a lot going against it. Its badly located most of the work commute needs a change of subway lines. There is a wide variety of restaurants but nothing to call home about. the room service is plain bad. the hotel is efficient checkin is smooth.. rooms are large and spacious and very clean.. loved the balcony and garden in the balcony.  But at the end of the day for the price I expected more....,3,
"I stayed in this hotel last June 5-7, 2016. First impression:   the lobby was so full of loud and rowdy Korean and Chinese tourists that made me wonder whether I was a welcome addition to their burgeoning guest list.   The size of the hotel is its own weakness.  The hotel staff attends to so many guests that room service is so poor.  I asked for a toilet paper and it took hours before it was delivered.  My room was huge but there was nothing spectacular about it.  The bed was a bit hard but the pillows were ok.  You cannot use the fridge inside your room because of the warning that rearranging any of the items inside it will automatically result in room charges.  Such a very obtrusive policy. Food is very expensive but I liked the iced tea in Sky 57.  The infinity pool is so…",3,
"Yes it's all about the pool. Once you  see it its a definite ""wow"" moment, BUT good luck getting a lounge to enjoy the  view. The room was modern and what we expected, overall way to busy, lacks personal service. Once is enough for us. ",4,
"I enjoyed my 2 nights pleasant stay at MBS simply because of the experience of Skypool and the wonderful view of Garden by the Bay. Smooth checked-in at club member counter when I arrived. I've opted for a garden view of  Premier room as I can enjoy watching Garden by the Bay's light show every night from my balcony.  The room is spacious and their room service was pretty good. I have to give my compliment to one of their staff Shi Ming as he has done a great job! Skypool view was amazing and you can non stop taking pictures however it was too crowded and I chose to go there around 7pm to avoid the crowd. My night time activity was to go to their Casino to try my little luck :-) Well, I'm still pretty in love with my recent visit to MBS and I had a beautiful memory with my loved…",5,
Soo worth the price. Got to check in early and room upgraded to a bath. Fabulous staff; all were pleasant and went out of the way to help. The pool is amazing and a major perk of being a guest. The view from the sky park is lovely. Dined at rise buffet; so much to choose from and all cooked perfectly. Would 100% recommend. ,5,
"No worry if you have decided to stay there, you can be sure you will get a great view and a few pictures. But nothing else.  No emotion, no exclusive feeling, or unique experience.  In fact ... This place is better when you look at it from outside. Or simply go to the top and watch the city, you will get 80% of the benefit of being at MBS. Staying there doesn't add value to its great architecture and design.  The pool is more a big bath with too much people staying there (access is exclusively for customers with a room)! So they stay, watch the city, stay again, take a selfie, and another one, etc. Service at the various bars doesn't help neither. Amazing how the people working here are desengaged. So finally Just go to MBS for a short time and a few pictures, and after... enjoy…",3,
"Ambivalent about the experience. The Premium room was spacious and nicely appointed. The rooftop pool however was a disappointment, reminiscent of a community pool in a middle-class neighborhood. The crowds, the kids running around, the resultant chaos took a lot away from the experience and the enjoyment of the view. Probably a victim of its own success, the pool did not appear inviting enough to warrant a second visit.  he entrance to the pool area with the small store and the stand, along with the smells of fried oil coming from the adjacent bar restaurant, had a decidedly low-class appeal. But come to think of it, it prepared you for the mad rush to find a lounger by the pool and the disappointment of having failed. There are better and classier rooftop pools in Singapore. …",2,
Something remarkable about Marina Bay Sands is the level of service the staff provide given the large number of guests. It's really quite exceptional. Dining or drinking cocktails in restaurants on the Skypark is impressive with incredible views and cooling breezes. Lunch at Sky on 57 will go down as one of the most memorable meals I've had. Super fresh and incredibly well prepared and balanced seafood that was world class. The horizon pool is kind of out of control. We found it uncomfortably crowded and more than a little unhygienic.   I think you need to be prepared to spend a lot to really enjoy the experience. We were in a club room which meant we didn't have to fight the hoards for breakfast in the mornings and were provided with a high level of personal service.,4,

"Marina bay  is a LasVegas style hotel. Despite the fact of being big they are able to provide a good service  Staying at the concierge level is a garanty of privacy.  The swimming pool is the place. The view is extraodinary. You must try it . Around the pool you have a good restaurant and nearby , the spa. The mall and the hotel are in the same building. Rooms are big.",5,
"Our son shouted us a holiday at Marina Bay Sands . Excellent room with fantastic views of gardens one side and city the other.  Elevator ride up to the pool area is quite  an experience. As is the pool. Food is excellent ,plus friendliness of staff .Everyone was so helpful and I fully recommend their Sunday buffet lunch . Food of all nationalities , and if their was anything else you wanted they would oblige by getting it elsewhere..Will definitely be going back next time in Singapore",5,
"Booked an Orchid Suite to accommodate 3 generations for this celebration. Room was spacious, comfortable & most of it, a musical view of Garden by the Bay. Easily accessible to town areas by all means of transportation.",4,
"First of all, this isn't a 5 star hotel. The service is no better than a mediocre three star hotel, and the room was no better than a four star quality. The only things five star about it is the grand scale of the whole operation: the mall, the casino, the museum, the laser show, and of course the pool. As individual parts however, I think only the pool is truly a 5 star experience.  Some advice: If you're staying in Singapore, I DO recommend staying here. The location is perfect for seeing the supertree grove, the laser light show at MBS, the cloud forest, etc. The main attraction is of course the infinity pool, and it is worth it. However, I wouldn't spend more than a night at this hotel. It simply isn't worth it. Spend a night and a morning at the pool then transfer to a…",4,
"The greatest thing about MBS is the staff. They are very accommodating, especially bellhop (they have a more professional title that I can't remember). He basically took care of our welcome and check out. He even arranged a van for us to the airport - there were 6 of us and 18 pieces of luggage.  The rooms were fantastic, our party had 2 rooms, one with the garden view and the other on the city view. They were both fantastic and had their own merits. The garden view room had a huge balcony and you could enjoy the sunrise and sunset from there. The city view room had great views of the city and the light show, so you could enjoy the show in the comfort of your room.  We had the most fantastic lunch buffet at Rise. There were too many dishes to rave about but here are our…",5,
"Astounding architecture, impressive lobby, world class restaurants and probably the best buffet selection ever. So far so good! Mediocre bathroom which was nice but not great. Mediocre bedroom which was nice, but again, not great. For being voted as one of the best hotels in the world, we were somewhat disappointed with the room. Not because there was anything wrong with it, but it just wasn't as fancy as the rest of the place. The exterior is flashy, modern and super cool. The rooms- old fashioned, and something you'd expect of the Hilton. Terrible carpets, bad colour scheme, poor room interior design. ",4,
"The Marina Bay Sands is an international hotel with five star accommodations and world class customer service.  I stayed for five nights and enjoyed every second of my time.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had with black out curtains and was the perfect temperature.  The breakfast buffet is the best I've encountered anywhere in the world.  Just across the street from the convention center and close to the transit system you can't be the location. Be sure and spend time at the roof top hotel and take lots of photos.  You will feel as if you are in paradise. Pricey, but worth it.",5,
"Swimming in the Marina Bay Sands has been on my bucket list for a fair few years now and since my partner and I were spending 2 weeks in Malaysia we thought we would make a quick stop over for the experience and what an experience it is! We could only afford one night and arrived at 11:30am since we had an early flight from KL and was given access to our room even though check in wasn’t until 3pm.  When the butler opened the door we were astounded by the view – we had been given a garden view on the 16th floor and it was absolutely stunning. The room itself was massive, clean, and had everything you could need. You could literally turn up with nothing but a change of pants and you’d be sorted – and even then you could make a quick stop to the mall below ;) We only had 2 days and…",5,

"We arrived in the evening of the first night. What greeted us was a lovely room with two attached rooms for shower and toilet. It had a long bath and the towels were adequate for three persons.  It had a view fronting the sea and the super trees from the Gardens by the Bay in the distance. The Singapore Flyer was distinctive and gave a more sublime glow to the night sky.  In the evening the laser show was  dismal compared with the streaming rays from the hotel. If we could have the time to watch the rays from Merlion Park, it would have made my evening more enchanting.",4,
"Hotel is great, awesome pool with beautiful scenic view all across the hotel.  Would suggest to take room on Tower 3 and preferably rooms above 35th floor and number between 20 to 25, they all provide beautiful landscape view of SIngapore  Food options for Indian food are very limited but in Asian food and other continental food is really good.  Staff is courteous and provides excellent service and are more than eager to help.  Skypark pool and casino are must go and shouldn't be missed at any point.  Try and stay there at least for couple of nights at this hotel to have an experience of life",5,
"The view is amazing and the elevator ride is quite an experience for first timers. However, the line for the breakfast - with a an average food offer not to say poor - makes you wonder if the price you pay for a view makes sense. All the rest, location etc it's very nice. The room we were in was big and we didn't fancy the deco but that's just personal taste. ",4,
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights in January 2016. It was my 2nd time in Singapore and I especially picked this hotel because I wanted to see the reclaimed area of the new marina and the infinity pool overlooking the city that I saw in pictures. I enjoyed Singapore the 2nd time around and found it more interesting than the first time I was here mainly because of the addition of the marina.  There were plenty of things to see & do around the hotel so I cannot imagine a better location in Singapore.  Last time, I stayed in one of the fine hotels on Orchard Road.

"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in a quick trip to Singapore because trying out their infinity pool had been on my bucket list for years, as I'm sure it has been for many people.  The pool was definitely worth the stay. We didn't spend as much time there as we wanted due to bad weather and other factors but the rooftop itself is well designed and very relaxing if you find a space to yourself. We went for a swim early and it was very busy. The pool is divided into three sections with one section reserved for adults only. This was largely ignored by most parents but the lifeguards did a fantastic job ushering the kids and their families to the other pools.  The hotel room we stayed in was beautiful and very comfortable. The garden view was peaceful and lovely when it…",4,
"The pool is the big draw for the MBS. The entire MBS complex is similar to those in Las Vegas, including bus after bus filled with tour groups. We stayed in a Premier Room on the 35th floor with views overlooking the bay which was lovely. The rooms themselves were large and nice, but not anything extraordinary. Service was good, though would be difficult to be more personalized in such a gigantic complex. Stay once for the pool, otherwise stay at a real 5 star hotel in Singapore. ",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is a great place where you can enjoy petfect sky during the day, it will be such more beautiful at night. Enjoy the Singapore city lights. And It will be perfect if you come together with your love ones. :) I was there alone, but I'll be there again next time with someone I love :)",5,
Easily accessible location with friendly greetings once we arrived at hotel lobby! Efficient check in process despite from heavy traffic at the reception.   Nice view from room balcony and amazing experience at infinity pool! Nice bar staff service when taking drinks and food order at the pool with crowded. We were very happy with the experience despite there was a sudden rain!  Will definitely come back when we visit the city next time! It's worth for experience:),4,
"Thought I would treat my lovely wife to a few days at the Sands after reading all the reviews.  At $420 per night for a standard room without breakfast included it is at the more pricy end of the scale even on Singapore standards.  Great room but that is where it stops.  The hotel is so big that it has no soul about it, staff see you as a room number only.  The lobby is manic with guests crowding every available space.  Don't even think about eating here, breakfast is $35 for a bowel of corn flakes (no joke) $55 for a very average cooked breakfast.  Don't even think about drinking here.  $18 for a cup of coffee and a cup of tea.  $16 for a local beer.  I must say that the hotel is not worth the hype in my opinion.  Pool was very crowded and noisy no matter what time of day, too…",3,
"We had an executive suite that was spacious and obviously had an amazing view of both the city and the gardens.  The staff is organized, prompt, and helpful.  It was more worthwhile to have our dinners brought directly to our room for the privacy and quiet AND the great view than to sit upstairs in one of the restaurants.  The pool is interesting and has an epic view, but it's still just a pool.  Depending on what kind of bankroll you have in your pocket, you're better off saving your money and staying somewhere else that's more affordable or somewhere with much more character and then just visiting the towers for dinner and drinks to get the experience of it all than actually staying there.",3,
If you can manage you should at least stay here for a day. Huge and spacious rooms. Amazing view from the rooms. One thing that separates this from the rest of the hotels os the infinity pool. You can just see the whole Singapore sitting in the pool. The breakfast is also amazing. You get a varietu of options.,5,
"Swimming in the rooftop infinity pool was in my bucket list and worth a one night stay in the hotel. But I probably wouldn't stay here for more than one night but instead move to a lesser priced 5 star hotel in the city because what the hotel offers is no different than others (sans the pool). I would recommend upgrading your room to a Club Room for the free breakfast, afternoon tea and early cocktails. It is worth it (if you are staying just one night). But the hotel bathroom products are their own and are not luxurious but more like Holiday Inn quality. The shampoo leaves your hair feeling coarse and smells cheap (like something you would expect at a 3 star hotel like Best Western)  so I would highly recommend folks bringing their own products (esp if one plans to swim).…",4,
"I know I don't need to explain this. I know many people are taking photos of yourself at the rooftop swimming pool. I know the view from the pool is like you are swimming in the sky.  I enjoyed it.  Not cheap, it's worth it.  I would do it again and again.",5,
"Marina Bay Sands is a good hotel. It's not great though. Check-in was very slow, as there were many people. While there are many lifts, it took me a while to get to the 31st floor. Waiting for the lifts is also a really big issue. Sometimes I waited for more than a minute.   The room itself was very big and spacious. The bathroom was also very good. However, the highlight was the view overlooking the city. It was amazing.  The pool is nice but overrated and busy most of the time.  Overall Marina Bay Sands is good. It's very expensive, and you're mostly paying for the brand. I'm sure there are cheaper hotels that are better.",4,
"The hotel:  We stayed in the MBS for 4nights during our honeymoon and we loved everything about this hotel and the beautiful city/country that is Singapore.   The room was brilliant, only on the 8th floor but we overlooked the gardens by the bay which are beautiful. Everything was clean, everything is modern and yes this hotel is BUSY and BIG we loved exploring every part of it and we loved the hustle and bustle of Singapore. We were impressed with the staff also, every single member of staff from cleaners, to waiters, to reception even to the lifeguards were all super friendly and helpful. The best part of this hotel though obviously is the Infinity pool. I've never enjoyed a view so much in my life and I've been up the Burj Khalifa, the Eiffel Tower and the Las Vegas…",5,
"it's absulately perfect hotel. i know it's expensive but even for a night you must stay there. great experience. pool bar foods and drinks reasonable prices. stay at the 57th floor, incredible pool as much as you can :)",5,
"MBS is a quite uneventful hotel when it comes to rooms and food. However, the pool area is out of this world. Definitely worth spending a day in the hotel to gain access to it. There are many opportunities catering for people with various interests in walking or short taxi ride distance, such as the aquarium, universal studio, and Sentosa beaches.  But make no mistake - the hotel is owned by Sands, so the main purpose of most visiting there is to visit the casino.",4,
Going here to see the view is amazing.  From what you can see the Hotel would be fabulous for a holiday.  The view is magnificent and if you are only in Singapore for a short time then this and a drink at Raffles should be on your list.,5,
"Massive modern hotel which is operated more like a business than a hotel. If you are looking for something smaill, quaint and quiet this is definitely not the place for you. However, if you are looking for efficiencny where things work and you are treated as a professional this is the most amazing place. Linking to a large shopping mall, the metro and undoubtbly the most beautiful pool deck I have ever seen.",5,
"A fantastic hotel with some fantastic staff. Very expensive but worth every penny. Make sure you check out the swimming pool and try the cheeseburgers. The only average part is the bar at the top. Felt like I was in a scene from the matrix. Attracts your wealthiest people and not really a good scene. Also, 40 bucks for a beer is a bit overkill. ",5,
"There's no doubt you can get better and more personalised service at smaller 5* establishments, but if you take into account this place has 100's of rooms is very good. The pool is worth the cost alone. That's why you go there. Perfect for a couple days in a City view room. I'd split your time between a couple hotels for better value if in town for longer. Also pay for city room, you don't want to pay $400 per night not to get a good view ",5,
"The conference was in the adjoining conference centre so it was the logical place to stay (previously we stayed in another hotel and walking or taking cabs was a pain) and I am glad I had the experience. The rooms and service was really excellent even though this is a HUGE hotel - three towers. I avoided the casino but did have a wonderful drink on the roof top bar overlooking Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia! The view from the pool is wonderful but there were so many people in the pool taking selfies of the view I decided to forego the swim. The hotel adjoins the shopping malls which is huge and has lots of shops, restaurants and convenience stores. It is very expensive there, so better value can be found elsewhere. The hotel itself was really great.",5,
Stayed one night at this hotel and in total booked 4 city view rooms for business associates. The check in process was smooth and staff friendly. One even escorted us to our rooms and took time to explain the facilities.  The rooms were very spacious and most importantly clean. The views over the city are impressive to say the least and the hotel is adjoined to a shopping mall. Undoubtedly one of the finest hotels I have stayed and overall best experience.  The breakfast was excellent too.  The only slight issue was that it was so difficult to make the booking without using a credit card . I wanted to book and pay for the rooms 2 weeks in advance and this proved to be quite difficult with staff insistent that a credit card was needed (even though all the room charges were to be…,5,
"stayed for a night as it was the closest hotel to my business meeting. price as expected was exhorbant. I requested for early check in , and upon arrival i was given access to the gym to freshen up there!! not expected from a 5 star property.  There was no evening service of the room which i expected to refil my water bottles etc. Bathroom amenities were ordinary. breakfast for $50 and the spread was not worth the price again.  Having said that, the infinity pool had amazing views, but dont get fooled by the pictures. anytime you go there are 50 people in the pool , all taking pictures.",3,
i love all the details of this hotel. Built very class. The staff are polite and helpful. I find the swimming pool very relaxing. Nice view from the top. Shopping malls can found down. Hope to be back soon.,5,
We stayed in this amazing hotel while visiting Singapore and were not disappointed. The view from the 57 floor is amazing and not to be missed is the night show at Gardens by the Bay below. The world famous infinity pool is on the 57 th floor and it is an amazing view of Singapore while relaxing in the cool water. Staff is very helpful and courteous. The suites are huge and all have fantastic views of the harbour or gardens. It is worth the experience to treat yourself to a night here. ,5,
"I have been going regularly to this hotel for years. I of course like it for the great view from the top and from the rooms, but I also used to like it for the exclusive feel it was giving through impeccable service. I noted during my previous stay that it was getting quite crowded. I noted during my last stay last week that this is not improving, and that it is starting to affect the way staff is handling people. I would suggest to management to look into this: a great hotel is about the way it serves clients, and quite frankly I did not feel treated great this time. Good, but not great. And that is a big difference...",4,
"Had booked a 2 nights stay at the top modern Marina Bay Sands, and had splurged a bit and opted for a Club Room since this was my first visit to Singapore.  Arrived a bit early (12:00) for check-in (starts at 14:00) and was at first a bit taken aback by the scale of the hotel towers and the large check-in/check-out area. There were quite a queue of people checking out, but I soon found the dedicated Club/Suite check-in. I was pleasantly surprised when I was allowed to check-in, but since the room was not ready, they offered to mail or call me as soon as it was ready. My luggage was taken care of and I went for a stroll to explore the hotel and the shoppes. An hour later, I got a call that my room was ready and I just needed to get my key activated at the check-in. Again I was…",5,
"What a view! Too pricy but it's worthy!! Service in the lobby was amazing! Very friendly staffs, assissts you and respond to every concerns.. What i loved the most was the detailed designs, structures and it is really close to perfection. If you want to get bloated with good sights, i suggest you guys to come & experience the beauty I experienced. ",5,
"I stayed at this hotel as part of a conference. The hotel is far too big (more than 2.500 rooms) and is always very busy. The infinity pool offers amazing views, but is almost overcrowded. On the positive side, there is a MTR station and a shopping center inside the hotel and Gardens by the Bay is just across the street.",3,
Great hotel and awessome experience! Is overcrowded at times especially at check in but service is great. Views from infinity pool are amazing. Easy to get to from trains and buses and easy access to gardens by the bay. Very expensive..would have liked to stay longer but unfortunately couldnt afford it. Would recommend staying here :),5,
"The stay at this hotel is an impressive and great experience for everybody. It is an luxury and ""High class"" hotel. The service is very fast and the peoples are very friendly. They are very ambitious for making a good stay. The infinity pool is great and a must see on the Skypark",5,
"Staying at Marina Bay was superb! I cannot express much how I feel about the place. It's got everything you will ever need whether you are on business trip, on a tour or maybe just having a staycation with family, This is my first time staying there and I am not disappointed one bit at all.",5,
"Excellent/amazing hotel: good location, unbelievable view, best service and the most beautiful rooftop pool with unforgettable view. A must see/visit. A great gift for yourself and for those you love (or hate; they will love you after visiting it).",5,
"I stayed two nights in this hotel and it was fabulous. Can't get any closer to the botanical gardens and the pool was even better than in the photos you see online. Also had a few drinks at the bar downstairs which had a live band. And, the breakfast was ok. I've had better breakfasts at cheaper hotels. The red bus tour picks up right next to the hotel, too. So you can't beat the location.",5,
"We travel a lot we have been in several hotels rated over 5 or 6 stars .. and during our first visit to Singapore in 2015 I booked 1 night at the Marina Bay Sands... according to all the reviews and good comments ..We arrived the  ""check in"" was fast without problems and efficient.. ..We opened the room and we found hair and rest of food in  the room ...the frames of the air conditioner full of humidity mushrooms something that can cause asma and other respiratory problems..I called the Management and request a change or an upgrade..even if we were already in a room with view over the Singapore's skyline... The reply was fast but really aggressiv the lady on board during the night shift was not so constantly with her work...really rude and she thought with a free bottle of wine…",3,
"The views were amazing, but unfortunately was ruined by the service because it was roaring with people and room service to incredibly long. Waiting was long and was quite expensive even for three people. Because there is nothing much to do here if you visit Singapore a lot - I suggest staying for 2-3 days.",3,
"Staying in Tower 3, great water views.  Wonderful pool on 57th floor.  Perfect location for the steamy weather as can access shops, food outlets, entertainment, train etc without going out in heat.  An enormous place and so central for visiting all the gardens.",5,
"We were very lucky to get a room upgrade so we had a big room with a a nice view,  a big barhroom with a separate bathtub, shower room and toilet, and 2 wash basins. The staff were friendly and helpful. The view was excellent from the observation deck and infinity pool. The only thing we didn't like here was that you have to pay extra just open the ref so your drinking water isn't cold.",5,
"Excellent service, very spacious and clean room, staff were accommodating and friendly. Our two-nights stay was really memorable, when we mentioned that it was our honeymoon, they made a surprise special arrangement for flowers and chocolates when we came back to the room. Just one suggestion though, it would have been perfect if there is a bidet next to the toilet.",5,
"This was my second time staying in the hotel, the first time was in 2013 for leisure, this time I went there for a conference and stayed for 5 nights. The hotel provides great facilities such as a decent gym (avoid the morning rush as it's often crowded and you won't be able to find a treadmill) and a pool with great view overlooking the skyline of Marina Bay, but if you ever think of having a good swim in the pool, you can pretty much forget about it as it is often filled with people, and during peak hours like 2-6pm on weekends, you can hardly get a sun deck chair to put your stuffs.  The restaurants located mostly at level 57 are quite somethings. I have tried the Ce-La-Vi, Sky 57 and Spago (both casual and formal dining), Ce-La-Vi left the most memorable experience among all…",3,
"It's not my first stay here.  I first stayed during the soft opening period years ago (at a very bargain rate), then came here a couple of years ago with our young daughter, who then enjoyed the pool tremendously, though she was banned from the jacuzzi at the time.  She turned 10 recently and as a birthday treat, we came back as a family for one night.  The hotel is still of 5 stars standard, the room is spacious and well appointed but any interaction with the staff is very impersonal.  The reception uses clever tricks to offer an ""upgrade"" (30 SGD++) when you check in early if you have booked on line through a booking platform such as Agoda, booking.com or TripAdvisor.  The view is great but won't keep you more than a day.  The swimming pool is overcrowded (though very strictly…",3,
"This is a huge property, and sparkling clean.  The rooms were very nice, and the pool deck is amazing.  It is absolutely packed with people, though.  Waits for the elevator, squeezing into the pool, lines, lines, lines.  Good to experience one time, but would likely stay somewhere else next time.",4,
"Huge room with great view, comfy bed, pool table, living area, pantry, mini bar, dining table, walk in closet, luxury bathroom, guest toilet.  Had a great experience and will definitely be back. Service staff was world class, front desk was helpful. Dining around MBS is superb. The sea urchin, as always, Fantastic. Keep warm when you go for a swim at the Infinite Pool, and please spend more than half a day up there.  Personally I love the garden view.",5,
Very very good place the hospitality is something out of expectations and view was like wow I had a stay for one day only looking at my budget but I felt the one day was not enough for me my room was on 27 floor tower 3 and garden bye the bay was my facing .sky park and swimming pool I can say 8 wonder of the word ...,5,
"As noted in other reviews this hotel has an amazing rooftop pool that only guests can use. However, the rooms and other services (especially food & drinks) are very expensive - even by Singapore standards. You are definitely paying for the name / brand. I would recommend only staying 1 night in a club room (better value with breakfast & complimentary drinks / food from 5 - 7 pm). ",4,
"We have been in this hotel during our honeymoon, and we are really happy of our choice. The hotel is simply...amazing, with the curtains opening automatically when you enter into the room, the Infinity pool on the 57th floor that finishes to the edge of the building making you see all the city by that height, while doing a warm bath. All personnel is very kind, polite and friendly. It's also possible to eat nearby the swimming pool, freely or seating in the restaurant (more expensive, but cool). To the ground there are also the Metro station, a huge shops gallery, the Casinò and the communication bridge with the Gardens by the Bay, where there are the ''super-trees'' with which they do a show of lights and sounds every evening.  A spectacular and unforgettable place where to…",5,
"This is one of the best property we stayed and enjoyed. We were on floor 47th and the room size was just excellent. Room service was a call away.  Issues:- Being vegetarian we faced little problem with the choice in breakfast, though staff was always helpful and tried there best, but they should give more choice for Vegetarians.  Rest all superb  Would love to visit again. ",4,
"Just stayed two nights at Bay Sands Tower 3 for the Deluxe City View Room , the three towers building itself is already very attractive to all visitors to Singapore, plus connecting to a huge luxurious shopping mall where shows more modern/elegant than Macau. The hotel service is efficiency to fulfill my needs. But this 2000 rooms hotel always be full of hotel guests & non guest tourists. I would call here likes an ""International Airport"" crowded, busy & noisily, however still worth to try staying once.  ",4,
Hotel structure is the main attration its was truly awesome.i m stay for one day in this hotel.infinity pool at top of marina bay sands is such a amazing blow everyones mind.great hotel staff.rooms are preety good.all the things in room in a new condition.morning breakfast is good.if u are visit singapore than u should visit marina bay sands one time.totally worth the price.have a nice journey ahead..thanks,5,
"Hotel was very crowded, especially the swimming pool. During afternoon.you cannot swim at swimming pool.  But at night, it's less crowded. Even though it was difficult to get a seat near by seimmijg pool, pool bar staff was very professional and freindly.",4,
"This is the second time I stayed in Marina Bay Sands. Considering this is a 5 Star hotel, it doesn't feel like it at all. June is an off-peak period for holidays but there are crowds everywhere especially in the lobby and most of all inside infinity pool (which is understandable of having 2000 guest rooms). This hotel is all about the brand itself, nothing special anymore. The only main attraction of this hotel is the proximity to Gardens by The Bay and the Infinity Pool which was too crowded as it was also hard to find a chair to chill beside the pool for my partner and I in which we had to ask if people were using it or not so we had to wait few minutes (used towels left behind everywhere, so basically nowhere to sit down). It got a bit frustrating. BUFFET WAS WAY OVERPRICED.…",3,
"This was ideal for a stay-put, two night stopover over during a long trip from Europe to New Zealand.  We could use the SkyPark (57th floor) pool, and visit the magnificent Gardens By The Bay.  Take time to visit the conservatories and perhaps the SuperTrees walkway or bar. Consider the buffet breakfast in the intimate company of about 500 people....Or, go to the coffee shop for simpler fare. As you please.  The hotel is certainly impressive, check out the Wikipedia entry for the MBS.   It is very expensive ( don't forget you have to add 17% service charge and local taxes to everything).  But, its an experience you are signing on for.",4,
"I am starting to loose confidence with the entire organisation of this hotel...the vehicle management entrance at TOWER 1 is getting from bad to worse!! Its just so baffling...be it drop off, taxis, even your limo...they are all over the place!!",3,
"this was thebest ever experience i've ever had in my whole life so far. The place is way more deserving than 5stars! it was my first ever out of the country trip with my fiance. and yeah, it was amazing! especially the infinity pool! quite expensive but worth the price. 😍",5,
"The ambiance is great... the experience is worth it. The infinity pool is amazing. The room was nice , clean , well appointed but not worth the price. You pay for the view. The first time the room service came through they organized all our belongings.  Amazing. The sodas in the mini bar were $8 a piece. We went to the attached mall to a convenience store and paid $5 for four. So much to do in this hotel though... I'm conflicted if I'll stay again .. if you can afford it at least stay a day or two for the memories. ",4,
"👆🏻NOT recommended if you plan to stay there for more than one night. The facilities are so old! Check out time too early (yes 11:00am believe in your eyes and the room card)! In the morning at 6:00am I even heard a woman screaming in the corridor crying ""help!!"" loudly so I rang the reception asking them to send someone to check. BUT!!!! No one came. Feeling very unsecured. ",4,
"We stayed here for one night of our six nights tour in Singapore and felt it was too little a time to experience and explore this luxury hotel...  The main attraction of the hotel is its swimming pool, which is on the 57th floor... The pool gives an awesome view of the city.... Rooms were good with a beautiful view of the Gardens by the Bay... The beds in the room were however smaller in size... Breakfast buffet was very lavish and the staff too was very courteous... The price is little over the top but it is an experience in itself",5,
"We booked a deluxe garden view room to celebrate the wife's birthday and had made several requests prior to checking in.  One of our request was for early check in and when we arrived, we were pleased to find out that not only was the room ready, we were also given a complimentary upgrade to a Grand Club Room!  The Room was amazing, with both garden and city views.  Within 10 minutes of us getting into the room, foam pillows were delivered as requested without us have to follow up.   The Hotel was also very nice and organized a complimentary birthday cake for the wife and the cake was very good!  Yes it is a big and busy hotel, but the staff's attention to details and requests  were amazing.  Check in was a breeze and the staff were efficient and very polite.  They even took the…",5,
"Awesome place to drink. Outstanding views. Pricey but Singapore is very expensive; this is on the high end of that. There's always a Casino underneath if you need more cash! Defo worth a visit for a few drinks if nothing else. Didn't eat there so can't comment on that. Dress code is smart. Trousers/shoes recommended to ensure you don't get turned away.   Only reason not 5 stars is because I did have to send a drink back twice because the mixer (coke) was completely flat, but I wouldn't let that put me off returning. Switched to cocktails which were great so will start on them next time!",4,
"Had to bite the bullet when deciding to stay here...so glad I did! The pool, though crowded, is amazing and really provides a great view of the city plus amazing photo opportunities. The shops downstairs, as well as the hotel's proximity to Gardens by the Bay, also made for a great stay. Probably would not come back here due to cost, but this is a great opportunity.",5,
"I'd give it a 1000 stars if I could.   My family and I didn't have much expectations coming here, but it truly blew our minds. The whole country was spotless, the people were very nice, and it was full of beautiful greenery unlike we've ever seen. The whole time we were here, we were in a state of awe. We only stayed here for 4 days but we wish we could've stayed longer.   If you end up coming here, you will not regret it. ",5,
"In a nutshell Marina Bay Sands is luxurious. You definitely get what you pay for. I can't believe this hotel doesn't have higher ratings on trip advisor. Yes, it is busy with lots of people, but the hotel is well staffed. The staff are pleasant, friendly, multilingual and deliver excellent service. The hotel is absolutely incredible. The rooms are amazing, the facilities are too notch, and the infinity pool itself is worth paying for a night's stay. The view of the city from Marina Bay Sands is breathtaking.",5,
Nice place to stay. Staying in tower 3 level 51. Room is clean and we choosed city view. Infinite pool is nice one. Big shopping mall is there. But brabded expensive goods. Local people need to pay 100 S$ for 24 hr to enter casino. Two theatres and celebrity chef restaurants are there to treat our taste buds. Need to wait long queue to get taxi in weekend days. Big car parking is available. ,4,
"I wasn't having sky high expectation but the moment I walked into the lobby with an elderly, 1 baby and 1 kid, there wasn't any seating area while we're waiting for hubby to check in. And this is a 5 stars hotel... Tourists were seen squatting or sitting at the side while waiting for their rooms/tour bus.   Room is spacious and that's about it.   The mini fridge in the room cannot be use as it's packed with snacks and drinks. Once you remove, you'll be charge. So there's no place to store the breast milk for the baby. They can provide another mini fridge but it's chargeable.   I called the hotel front desk/operator to ask where can I store my breast milk and they said they can have someone come to our room to collect it. Can choose to put in freezer or chiller.  Generally, they…",2,
"This is a great endorsement for Singapore, a hotel that is truly creative and captures everything hotel guests could want or imagine.   Check in was easy, and without complication. The elevators take only moments to get you to your desired floor. Our room on level 43 provided an excellent view of the city and was incredibly spacious. Loads of room to lay out belongings, and relax. The bed was a king with well appointed linen. a great nights sleep especially with the room temperature control. The bathroom had ample space with a nice shower that provided good pressure.   The other features of the hotel make it easy to suit your needs. The rooftop pool is an excellent experience and provides memorable images of Singapore be it day or night. Poolside service for food and drink is…",5,
"Me and Hubby stayed here for a week and we loved the place. Since its our first time in Singapore, Marina Bay Sand threat us very well. We enjoyed the food, room service at its finest. Amusing luxury cars for rent down stair but we didn't get a chance to try it as we have so little time to spend in the city.    The pool is very crowded since they open it to the public. People who dont stay there somehow can use the pool.",4,
"The hotel is very crowded, but still very nice and service is good, despite the crowds. The pool is superb - you will never forget the view. The only downside was that in the room that was advertised as the room for three adults, the sofa was too small for an adult or even for a teenager - actually, that room is ok for 2 people instead of 3. The size of the room was ok, but 3rd bed is the problem. ",5,
"whether your headed for a business trip or for some fun with good friends. this hotel has it all... from conference rooms, casino, shopping, wine and dine to a rooftop infinity pool. the experience is always fulfilling to your every need.",5,
"Ok so the pool here is good, that is about it. The rooms were nice but service sucked. You well and truly feel you know there are another 2500 odd rooms in the hotel. The breakfast (rise) on the ground floor wasn't the best as it felt like you were eating in a tourist attraction.",3,
Wow what a hotel!! From the moment I stepped into the hotel lobby all the staff were so friendly and helpful! They upgraded me to bigger room free of charge and extended my check out as My flight was only at 11pm. The room was amazing and the pool - wow!!  This is a must visit when going to Singapore!!!,5,
"We had a wonderful staycation here with my 3 young kids aged 7,6 and 4. Beautiful and spacious rooms, and spectacular views in both the room and the skypool.  Every bit worth the experience!  If possible, do have a buffet meal at Rise Restaurant in the lobby. Fantastic quality spread-although not cheap, you do get what you pay for. = ) The only negative note was when my father in law checked us in, he was refused a 3rd kids pass for the sky pool.  I had to have a strong word with the manager and asked if the hotel was child unfriendly for the 3rd kids pass to be given. Even then, the manager gave a dour face. Something the otherwise excellent hotel should look into. ",4,
"this is my return trip back to MBS. given the price, I am not sure why still so many people are so crazy about staying there. The room is very spacious but with ordinary decoration and quality. You cannot find anything wrong with this hotel but still there is no special things about it except that the hotel is packed everywhere. the infinity pool, the lobby, the restaurants, almost everywhere. if you pursue something like exclusivity, not this hotel for sure.",4,
Spectacular hotel in the heart of the city. Luxurious with an infinity pool and amazing buffet breakfast spread. Great service. Only flaw would be it can get pretty crowded. Nonetheless will be back here again.,5,
"We have just returned home from a 3 night stay in the Marina Bay Sands Singapore. As soon as you pull up outside the hotel you are aware of how large it is (especially as we had come from a small boutique hotel in Bali), with 2500 rooms the hotel could be overwhelming for some guests. We stayed in a Orchid Suite with City view in Tower 1, which provide us with dedicated check-in services and club lounge access, this meant we were able to check in without joining the large queue for standard rooms. The hotel is divided into 3 towers, which are all connected either by ground floor or 57th floor, from ground floor you have access to shopping malls and the Marina, the 57th floor is the roof top infinity pool and restaurants/bar.  The Orchid suite was AMASING, this consisted of a…",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is my best experience in hotels worldwide! We got upgrade to club room and it was great with fabulous view. Infinity pool is good, but it's mostly for photos, cause there are a lot of guests and it will be hard to swim, but it's easy to find sunbed and you can swim at the evening.   We will fly back to Singapore and will choose only Marina Bay Sands! There are just one reason, why other hotel in Singapore can be better - view on Marina Bay Sands:)",5,
"We stayed in one of the top floors of MBS facing the sea and it was one of the BEST hotels we have ever stayed!   The beautiful seaview, the classy clean spacious room as well as the best linen and mattress we have ever slept on.   Just pay for it, i guarantee you it will be the best nights sleep you have ever had.   ",5,
"We arrived and left at off peak hours and there was no queue for the check-in/out but still these procedures managed to take an awful lot of time. I really think they should look over their processes because it was almost ridiculous how much the poor guy at the front desk was tapping in to the computer and yet there was nothing unclear or missing from our reservation of two rooms.  The rooms are spacious, modern and well kept. The cleaning was meticulously performed, with the staff going those small extra lengths that makes characterizes a top rated hotel. The infinity pool area is really awesome and although the hotel was fully booked when we were there, you could always fit in nicely by the pool without it feeling at all disturbingly crowded. The in-room dining service worked…",4,
"Arriving the hotel on the day of my partner's bday... got a free upgrade to city view at muchhh higher floor!!! :D  we were so happy :) And they say becoz it's a special day they are going to do some special in the room and ask us to keep the room open (as in not having the ""do not disturb button"" on while we go out)  Kept us exciting for the wholeeeee day! :)    Came back after a longgggg day in Sentosa and found there is nothing in the room :(i mean...we won't expect anything if the check-in staff didnt say anything at the very beginning...but.....this is kind of going up and then downnnnnnn)  Anyway!  Here are the plus & minus :) (+++) rooftop pool is amazing (especially when u got the seat where you can jump right into the pool!!! :D) (+++) spacious room and the view to the…",4,
"Had a girls' staycation the other time and we were impressed.  Free wifi and access to Sky Park. We love the swimming pool and the view but it was simply too cold! And the jacuzzi had too many people as well.  Impressive service, however concierge service was a tad too slow. Waited too long for check in.",5,
"Excellent hotel service. A lot of tourist attractions accessible from MBS - ArtsScience Museum, Double Helix Bridge, Gardens by the Bay, etc. Marina Bay Sands Skypark at the 57th flr is also a must visit as it offers spectacular views of the city. Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are pricey but the architectural design of the hotel is a must see. ",5,
I prefer the garden/sea view over the city view and it is something that I will miss upon waking up or upon entering the hotel room. Good wi-fi access. Check-in and check-out process very efficient and fast. Rise buffet is good! Pool area gets crowded. The infinity pool is too deep for most kids. The toddler pool is too shallow for most kids. Room service is excellent although expensive (5sgd for one cup of steamed rice!). The only disappointment for my father and husband is that they didn't have a sports channel that televised the NBA finals.  They only have golf and soccer channels which showed replayed tournaments.,4,
"The cons- We decided to go with the Grand Club room since it offered additional benefits such as breakfast, afternoon tea & canapés included but they turned out to be quite underwhelming to say the least. Breakfast was so-so, offering a combination of an American breakfast (sausages, beans, hash browns, bacon etc) & a few dim sum choices. However, afternoon tea was quite disappointing- we arrived at 3 (served 2-4) & there were only some sweet treats left along with very weak coffee. We didn't bother to venture out for Canapés. The pros- our room & view were spectacular, spacious & quite clean with a lovely tub & products for a soak provided, which I quite enjoyed. The staff are also very friendly & quite helpful  (especially Karla from the bar service area by the Sky deck). I'd…",4,
"We stayed here only one night because the pool was on my bucket list. I'm so glad we only stayed the one night as location was not great. If you choose not to eat at the hotel restaurants (and the options with kids aren't great) there is nowhere other than the food court which is still a decent walk away. We ended up ordering room service for breakfast. The room itself was quite spacious (I'd read on here that they were small) so that was a pleasant surprise and we had great views, however the whole experience was pedestrian. With so many people checking in and out, it was a very cattle class feeling and we were just a number. We stayed at the Fairmont prior to this and couldn't fault it.",3,
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights , the perfect amount of time to visit Singapore . The hotel is huge , the pool is amazing , you can only gain access to the pool with your room key. The bed was very comfortable , the room was quite & the bathroom was well appointed with a makeup mirror .The hotel is in a great location at Marina Bay , there is a shopping center with cafes & restaurants attached to the hotel , overall great stay",4,
four star hotel with five star views. I was keen to try the infinity pool and spectacular it is. Less spectacular is the number of people with there being almost no room. Changing rooms are in dinghy part of the building.  Nice as a one-off but will return to my usual haunts after this. Just too busy and tour-groupy for me.,4,
"Well, right from the get go walking in to the Marina Bay Sands Lobby, Beautiful! The staff were so friendly and everything was so clean! It is a little strict there with the rules but that's probably how they keep up there 10/10 standards. We also went to one of their roof top fine dining restaurants, again, 10/10!  I would recommend everyone going to Singapore for a holiday to stay here. So worth it. It's just incredible. ",5,
"Everything about Marina Bay Sands was outstanding - from the check in experience, to the staff, to the room. We stayed in a Club Room (very spacious and finished beautifully), which allowed us to use the Club 55 amenities - although slightly pricier, it was 100% worth it, for the benefits we experienced, including fabulous views at breakfast, and amazing 'cocktails and nibbles' from 5-7pm.   The pool and 'Sky Park' area was fabulous - swimming in the infinity pool overlooking the city was a once in a lifetime experience. Although it was busy, it never felt too crowded and there was plenty of staff to assist with towels, drinks and anything else you may need.   A special mention must go to all of the staff in the hotel - everyone we encountered was polite and friendly, and the…",5,
"We enjoyed our stay in the premier city view room with 2 small kids. On arrival at the hotel in their limo we were greeted by their hostess and escorted directly to our room which already had an extra roll-away bed and special kids amenities.   In addition to the roof-top infinity pool, the best part of staying at MBS is the easy access to excellent restaurants such as Bread Street Kitchen, DB Bistro and its food court. I’d prefer to stay here whenever I am in Singapore.",5,
We arrived at about 7.00am from an overnight flight thinking there would be little chance of getting access to our room till the afternoon.  We were thrilled to be taken directly to our room and did the check in there with the butler. Like many others we came to experience the pool and it was extraordinary and worth the visit.  It is incredibly busy during the day however early in the morning you can enjoy it without the crowds. We had a club room on the 48th floor with great views back over the city.  The rooms are huge but the decor feels a little dated.  The club lounge had fantastic views and the food was superb. ,4,
"Really had a great experience staying the hotel.The check-in process was really fast and the front desk agent Mr Suren was really helpful as he manage to get us a early check in. The bellboy Mr Madurai offered luggage assistance for us and he also provide us the information on the rooms and gym operation hours. We had great time enjoying the infinity pool and friendly staffs in Marina Bays Sands that we meet espeacially Mr Suriakumar from the bell desk at Tower 1.We ask him alot of questions on the local foods and shopping places ,he answered us without any anger and provide us the correct information which bring bring us to the places n time.He was even doing extra miles by getting us.  Staffs like Mr Suren,Mr Madurai and Mr Suriakumar really makes our stay wonderful and our…",4,
"For the money you spend, you don't get a ""wow"" lobby welcome and the rooms are ok.... But what makes up for it is definitely the 57th floor, the buffet ( made sense to pay separately and not include it in the booking ) and the amazing view from the rooms, be it lakeside or garden by the bay views. Would I come back? Sure, when my 2 year old becomes 15 and can remember this view.",4,
Amazing hotel pool service outstanding me and my son were sick some food poison in Thailand so when me check in hotel we felt not well so everyone knows this and try help us with doctors etc every few hours someone contact us ask about feeling Manager on duty organise for us extended stay for few hrs because we didn't use any facilities at hotel just we stays at room was sad but the hotel take care about us very well you feel welcome there everywhere my husband just try food and he said was amazing !!!very recommended ,5,
"My fiancé and I were visiting friends in Singapore but couldn't pass up the opportunity to tick swimming in the infinity pool at the MBS off our bucket lists.   Check in was a breeze, no queue so we were greeted straight away by a very welcoming lady.  We were accompanied up to our room was a lovely lady called Faye who passed on lots of useful information about the hotel it's and surrounding areas.  We booked a club room to take advantage of drinks & canapés from 5-7pm.  Unfortunately, due to a thunderstorm our flight had to circle a while so we didn't end up arriving at the hotel until 6pm which meant we missed the first hour in the Club 55 lounge. The time we spent in the lounge was excellent & there was a fantastic selection of canapés and drinks to choose from whilst…",5,
"My husband and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon. The hotel itself is stunning! Definitely worth visiting even if you aren't staying there. We were upgraded to a city view club room which was really spacious and had an amazing views of the city. We arrived at the hotel at 10am and even though check in isn't usually until 3pm, our room was ready for us to check in early which was fantastic after a 12 hour flight!  The hotel is amazing, with a shopping centre, casino, gardens, clubs, bars and tonnes of restaurants all within the resort. We'd highly recommend the C'est La Vie restaurant - we had the most delicious meal there!! The breakfast was also the nicest breakfast I have ever had at a hotel!   The iconic infinity pool is a must…",4,
"A bucket list must. Friendly and attentive staff, visit the pool at lunch time as it gets very busy in the evenings. Great view of the city, great time staying here! Easy to access MRT and you can get to other tourist attractions. About 25 minutes to the airport and around $25-30 approx for a taxi ",5,
"Wow, wow, wow what a place to stay. This hotel is first class all the way and really worth the quite hefty price tag.  If you stay at the hotel you have automatic access to the Skypark infinity pool which has to be one of the  best swimming pools in the world. To be swimming in an infinity pool 57 floors above the city is quite breathtaking, especially at night when the whole city is lit up before you..I couldn't imagine how many selfies have been taken in this pool. The pool is open to hotel guests only and you gain access by swiping your room card. This same system is used for the elevators in the hotel, you can only travel in them if you swipe your room card first. Our room was well appointed in number two tower on the 34th floor. The room had two queen size beds (extremely…",5,
Staying for two nights in Singapore we chose the Marina Bay Sands Hotel as a treat. We chose the cheapest room which was still expensive. We looked at the pool and had photos taken like everyone else staying at the hotel. It really didn't see a pool to sit and relax in. Location was good near all the shops and having it's own railway station is good.,4,
"We are Aussie  So who went to Singapore for no other reason than to swim in this amazing pool and that part did not disappoint , best pool ever seen and great wait staff on the roof most especially Brennan who was 7 star in everything. There were however disappointments can only book via Internet and had many questions. Booked with friends and requested same floor both got 28th floor different towers which was a real pain with our 12 year olds Also no room in fridge for even own milk which I had to pay $4.00 for so I could have coffee and they wanted me to rent another fridge at $10  Room next door had party on last night over 10 people in room loud music had to make 3 calls to front desk K at 11.30pm then 12.15pm then 1.30 am before hotel really stopped it not good enough. Pool…",4,
"We decided to land in Singapore to break our trip to Indonesia so we spent one night in this dream-hotel...we arrived very early in the morning and I had a flu so the concierge tried her best to give us a room asap; we could wait in the skypark where I could lay down and drink an orange juice (the waiter even brought me a cup of hot water to help me with the cold) - the landscape was amazing. They gave us a room in less than 2 hrs and I spent the whole day in bed while my husband went to the pool again and to the pharmacy...we could find everything we needed, the room was also fully equipped (and the view was stunning) plus the staff was so helpful...this is one of the most comfortable placed I have ever been to.",5,
"The hotel's driveway is very confusing.. Taxi's/private cars/shuttle sign is not being followed, we ended alighting in the middle of the driveway, with no one to help us right away w/ our luggages..  I know its very busy, but the fact that it was busy, and I think that happens everyday, atleast there should have been an added personnel to assist arriving guests or atleast monitor arriving guests esp. those w/ small children  But despite these minor glitches, Overall, our stay was great, we had a very nice big relaxing room and the staff are very accommodating..   I've been here before, so I know it was really a great hotel, thus, I keep on coming back.. I just hope they would improve their hotel driveway..",5,
"Terrible hotel...it seems an airport! Full of people! It's not an hotel, it's a tourist attraction. More than 20 minutes for a check in.  The wake up call waked us up at 5 am three times when we didn't ask for that service. There's no security at the entrance, somebody could put a bomb easily. Swimming pool is awesome but too crowdy. Better just for one night, it's not a five star hotel...",1,
"We stayed in this fantastic hotel on our recent trip to Asia. We had a Club Room which is on the corner (if you like) and are a fair bit larger than normal. It was a lovely room with a stunning view over Marina Bay and the city. The complementary Wi-Fi was outstanding. This is by no means a cheap hotel with food and drinks being very expensive. We had the use of the Club 55 (in tower 2) which served breakfast till 11am, the afternoon tea from 2-4pm, the afternoon drinks and nibbles from 5-7pm. This was all included in the room tariff and had excellent quality food and drinks available during these times. The nearby Gardens by the Bay are fantastic and should be on everyone's viewing list. Each night there is a lights show near the Supertree's which is very good. Definitely pay…",4,
"Stayed at MBS for a few nights, over at the Tower 3 with a nice garden & harbour view. The hotel's facility is great, offers amazing dining and shopping options.   But then we went up to the swimming pool around the evening for a dip & drinks, it was so crowded! To be honest, the pool was really disgusting as it was so murky and the towels have stain on it. Bugs were everywhere, I know this is a hotel for tourists but you just can't enjoy it at all.    Ups: - The reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  - Very convenient as shops & restaurants are accessible without walking outside.  - Full of choices for entertainment and dining. - the gym was clean & nice.  Downs: - The air con in my room was very noisy. - It was so packed that everytime when you get into the lift,…",3,
"For the price we paid, the service was not up to par. First impressions are important and at first when we arrived I felt as if I was at an airport. There was a long line to checkin and no one who helped with luggage. Upon finally checking in I had to ASK for someone to take our luggage up to the room. We were then told our room number with no guidance as to where to go. Walking around aimlessly, we found someone thankfully who graciously brought us right to our room and explained everything about the hotel to us. ( for those who don't know, the hotel is massive with three separate towers) Prior to us finding someone ourself, we would have been clueless about how anything worked and where anything was. When I pay $500 for a night, I am paying for the service yet I recieved…",3,
It is quite a walk from the foyer to the rooms/suites. Well appointed rooms & we were on one of the highest floors. View was quite spectacular. Pool area was exceptional & unique. Service especially at the pool side & coffee shop was quite outstanding. Breakfast buffet  was very enjoyable. Fresh produce including fresh juices not canned or bottled. Guest relations or the Lobby Manager was efficient. It was a pleasure staying.,4,
"Wow. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we felt that every cent we paid for the 1 night was worth it. Every single staff member is so friendly and helpful, I don't think I've seen it on this level in any other hotel. Upon check in we got a free upgrade from a deluxe to a premier room which was nice. As soon as I walked into the room my jaw basically hit the floor.... That view!! And we had a balcony which I didn't expect. The view of the Gardens by the Bay was unreal, especially to watch the light show at night. The room was massive with a huge bathroom as well. The bed was comfy compared to all the other hard beds I have slept on throughout Asia. The only negative I have were there was a table but no chairs on the balcony so you couldn't sit out there to enjoy…",5,
"We had the best time staying here, worth every penny! The view from the room over the city was breathtaking, the room was lovely and modern and spacious. Best part for me was the pool and the service we received, cocktails and food by the pool was lovely could have stayed up there all day every day!! ",5,
Best place to stay in Singapore. Super awesome hotel with artistically made swimming pool on the top. the view from there is spectacular. Rooms are so spacious and comfortable. Must visit place. Singapore without stay in Marina Bay is like not visiting Singapore.,5,
"This is by far the most perfect hotel in Asia! The rooms are huge and so is the bathroom! You have a great view of the shoppes, the gardens, and the whole Singapore while in your room or up on the view deck or at the infinity pool. It's the pool really that I love!",5,
"Our two night stay at the Marina Bay Sands was a good experience - very expensive and I'm not sure we would do it again, but certainly the staff and amenities were first class.  We booked a ""club"" room which entitled us to breakfast and cocktails in the afternoon with amazing canapes.  The pool was outstanding, although a little cold - i think they may keep it that way as it was very hot outside!  Three spas to choose from and an amazing shopping centre on the hotel's doorstep - so no need to leave the hotel.  I recommend the Cloud Forest and Garden by the Bay as a good tourist stop - the cloud forest was outstanding.",4,
"I had dinner here and we went to the night club. Absolutely amazing place and a must visit when you are in Singapore. We did not stay in the hotel but we got up to the roof with our dinner reservation and the night club was interesting too. The view is truly stunning, not to be missed.",5,
The infinity pool is the most amazing place on Earth!  The hotel rooms are fine- they lack character and I've stayed in better. But the hotel makes up for the rooms. The shopping centre is out of this world for designer and food. The casino is the largest in Singapore and the pool.........unbelievable!,5,
"Room had a beautiful view of Singapore City. Very high tech room. Curtains were controlled by remote which were by the bedside. Large and spacious bathroom. Separate standing shower area. Amenities provided. Coffee/Tea DIY in the room provided. Very clean towels. Generous with providing adequate towels too. Large king size bed with a couch in the room. Good security. You can't go up to the rooms unless you tap your keycard in the lift but lobby always crowded. They are very strict about check out time so at noon time, the lobby is like a market place.",4,
"The service of the staff was outstanding - the pool staff go out of their way to make you happy - On realizing we were there for my husband's birthday, the staff sent us a couple of free drinks. However the pool itself is quite dirty - I wasn't sure how often they clean it and it's always super busy! The room was spacious and well done up.",4,
"With a towering view of Singapore’s Marina Bay, the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel sits 57 stories up and is famous for one exceptional reason: it boasts the world’s longest rooftop infinity pool.  This of course is the main reason guests come to visit. From the moment the pool opens at 6am, all the way to closing at 11pm, the pool is a cultural melting pot filled with people holding selfie sticks to gather proof of their globally-recognized bucket list item fulfillment.  Food by the pool and the rooftop lounge & restaurant will cost you about $20 for a beer and $25 for a burger and fries, though that’s not unusual for Singapore where $100 USD is what it’ll cost you for dinner and a drink at any trendy restaurant in the city anyway, so relatively speaking, the price is right. …",4,
"Perfect hotel rooms and amenities, but prefer smaller boutique hotels for that individual, personalized service. The staff at Marina do try to give you this, but it's virtually impossible with that many rooms and people.   The lobby of the Hotel is like mall, constantly busy with crowds. ",3,
"Nice hotel.  Very large.  Connected to many amenities and options for both adults and children.  Room was clean.  Good service.  Nice pool and Sky Park.  Only problem was when I checked out I was informed the computers were down and I was not able to be provided my final bill.  I was told it would be emailed to me, but two days later I had still not received it and I had to email the hotel and ask for the final bill.",4,
"Just checked out after a nights stay celebrating my moms 60th birthday. The stay was a mixed bag with everything being exceptional except the rooms itself. We stayed in the deluxe rooms 4405 and 4406 which we interconnected as we were 5 of us. The reception staff were kind enough to upgrade  our room to a city view one. Very nice touch as the views were awesome from the 44th floor. Must  add that they gave us an early check in and also provided us with a nice cake for my mother. Thanks! Coming to the rooms one of them smelled horrible (I suspect someone brought some durian in the room.) Upon speaking to the service helpline someone came with a UV atomiser and room freshener. Didnt really get rid of the smell totally but we managed. My question is, isnt there housekeeping…",2,
"Stayed 4 nights (2rooms) with family. Kids loved the pool and spas. Skypark was great. Views to die for both day and night. Great buffet breakfast with expansive range of food. (Expensive tho at $57 adults). We found food court at ice skating rink just as good at $11 a head. Rooms were excellent however buy lots of snacks as room service very expensive. Room could do with a microwave.  Fridge was full to brim with drinks and chocolate. Once again too expensive.  We found taxis were cheaper, quicker and easier to use than MRT.  MBS is in very good location for all attractions.  If you are there on Friday or Saturday night there is a light show on at 8pm. If a foreigner and going to casino across the road make sure you take your passport for ID.  Gardens across the road are well…",5,
"We stayed here for a little 'treat' on our way to Thailand.  We were treaded with an update to a suite, which was amazing.  High floor, great view and the biggest bathroom I've ever seen! We of course went swimming in the Skypark (I think we were the only ones 'swimming' everyone else was taking photos!).  Lovely food at all the places we ate at.  But, this was a treat for us, a little expensive for our usual travel budget! One thing to be aware of, watch out for all the travellers with their selfie-sticks! :-) All in all, a great place to stay, especially when you pop up to the Chocolate & Cheese Buffet in the evenings on level 55 :-)",5,
"Treated myself to one night at this hotel, literally to get access to the pool!  What a wonderful experience. They say check in starts at 3 but I got there for 2.30 and my room was ready. I was fortunate to be up on the 46th floor (57 in total)with a city view. After a very easy, friendly check in I got to the room. As soon as you put your Keycard in the door the curtains open automatically and you're greeted with the most amazing view. Incredible!  The room was enormous, simply huge! An amazing King size bed, followed by a terrific lounge area with a sofa, chairs, table and desk over looking the city.  Everything you need was in the room, wonderful cosmetics, tv, safe, hairdryer, and iron - well you name it it was in there. The bathroom was a great size too.  Clearly the pool…",5,
"I visited on the 6/6 dining solo as a holiday treat to my self. I have a chafing background with some pastry experience so I was curious at the experience. I was not disappointed at all. The staff were attentive, professional and friendlywithout being annoying. Amazing views. Offered to take photos for me. The food was well worth every cent, quality chocolate and a wide range of tortes, pastries, gateau, mousses and warm desserts. Chefs were attentively topping up and tidying desserts. The wine flight was a good match for the food, the Chilean white wine went particularly well with the passionfruit desserts on offer. The spread of cheese was huge with a assortment of breads, crackers and condiments. The team there has done amazing and should be proud. Could not find a review…",5,
"The hotel is expensive, but worth a stay at least once.  The hotel is large (around 2,500 rooms), and it is a casino hotel, though we never set foot in the casino. The service was consistently very good. Every staff member that we encountered was polite, friendly, and came across as sincere in their desire to help and make sure our visit was pleasant. Everyone spoke English well. The pool is a big drawing card and the views are fabulous.  Club 55 has very good breakfast choices, good afternoon snacks and drinks, and the view is equally fantastic. There is a lot to do within close walking distance to the hotel and there are metro and bus stops at the hotel.  As one would expect, food is very expensive at the hotel and it can get busy.  If you do stay here, be sure to specify your…",5,
"We need to take elevator to reach rooftop pool, and we can see wonderful view once elevator opens. During the day time there are so many people, mainly family, but after 8PM, there are less people than day time.  I took breakfast at grand floor, but this also so many people. Sometimes almost all dishes are empty and you can take only fruit and vegetarian food.  There are also so many people in Casino area, so it will take little bit long time until you can enter the area due to security check, but you can enjoy the area once you finish the security check.  I think you can enjoy all day in this hotel though there are so many people.",5,
"went to sky tower had best view of singapore, overlooking at garden by the bay. infinity pool, high rise buildings, marina barage, with a sip of soft drinks...best place to relax, have a conversation with friend. going on top is free if you go to bar!",5,
"It was quick stop over to experience most famous entertainment place in Singapore.  Infinity swimming pool was fantastic except so many ppl were there.   Upon arrival accidentally I stopped by tower one. Probably cause of many group departure, staffs seems very stressed up. After that we moved to tower three then service was much much better.   It's really huge property and overall experience was great. Only one thing I felt very sad was staffs are chatting non operation topic even guests are waiting for assistance. It was a bit make me disappointed. Not everybody just a few section ...bell desk... Please improve about it. What a waste in such a wonderful property ppl are coming to visit from all over the world u know.",4,
I always love swimming pools especially at marina bay sands infinity pools... You can see the city skyscrapers.... The hot tub especially after along shoppings.... But its a bit windy in the evening... Make sure stay in the hot tub while enjoying the view ,4,
"The price is steep, but it's worth a stay at least for a day to get the best reception ever. The Check-in lines might seem heavy but in no time will you be put in the best hotel in Singapore. Even though the checkin time is 3PM, they could accommodate us at noon itself and with a free uprgade , can you beat that. We were put in the 50th floor and the view is nothing but spectacular.  The pool is crowded a it but out of world. I suggest to go in the mornings  when there is not much crowd, if you want unobstructed picturesque. They have a walkway exclusive to the Gardens by the Bay. Such a wide variety of food choices from Master Chefs to under 10$ street food all in one place makes very versatile in food options.  Of course , then there is the Casino if you are into some board…",5,
"Yes, you come for the pool The service is great, easily accessible to everything, and with endless options for food, shopping, and entertainment. SkyPark is a marvel in itself. The Chocolate Buffet is delectable. The Hotel even sent us champagne to help us celebrate our birthdays. The rooms aren't particularly fascinating, but the bathroom is lovely and you'll be on the roof anyway :)",5,
"This hotel has a great location. Staying at a landmark is amazing. The infiniti pool is a sight to see. The hotel has a large mall with a good food court and great tea shop. Last, it's connected to the metro system which is fully automatic!",5,
"Pros - Stayed here for 5 days as the conference  was in Marina Bay Sands. One thing that strikes me about the Hotel is that it doesnt actually give you a the feeling of a hotel all together. For the price that you are paying perhaps you would want a more personalized care . . .but then again Marina Bay Sands is an extension of the mall . . .or better said the mall is an extension of Marina Bay Sands Hotel . . The Infinity Pool makes it worth it :) There are 3 Towers 1,2 and 3 . We were staying in the third tower . . Its common to see folks in bathrobe in the lift going to the Infinity pool . . . but then it think it deserves a seperate review of its own :) . Wonderful city view from the room . . . and the service was good too just that felt like a mall :)",4,
"Highlight was infinity pool as all commented. Room is decent although amenities can improve. Service is excellent from reception till the rooftop pool, really care about the guest. A must try even for only the infinity pool when in Singapore",4,
"View of Singapore skyline was the highlight for me . Room was decent enough , just lacking a bit of the wow factor. the shoppes and restaurants at the casino make up for it though. A must is a photo from the infinity pool ...",4,
"After 3 weeks of backpacking through asia we decided to treat ourselves to one night in this unbelievable hotel.  Although we didn't check in till around 12:45am because of late flights, the staff were still super friendly and got us a better room than originally booked.  They also gave us a later check out for the next day in order to allow us more time at the hotel!  Our room was large with an amazing view of the gardens.  As you would expect from a five star hotel the bathroom was great and fully stocked as was the mini bar!  The bed was also so so comfortable.  We did the buffet breakfast in the morning at Rise.  It had a large selection of food and we would recommend getting there around 9:30 because it closes at 11 sharp!  The infinity pool and the view from it does not…",5,
Wow this place is HUGE amazing the Pool was stunning and surprisingly not crowded this is one for the bucket list a must do the room itself was small and you can't put anything in the fridge as you will be charged as it is weighted but you can hire one but the view was beautiful. You could actually spend days here and still not get around everything the shoppes are what you would expect expensive and luxurious the casino was a decent size just make sure you take your passport with you. A must do is Gardens by the bay AMAZING a must do at night 😃 enjoy and take it all in this place is the unbelievable!,5,
"This is a big hotel in a lovely area of singapore. It is busy with lots of people around everywhere.  If you like piece and quiet this may not be the place for you. However I enjoyed the buzz of people. Check in was seamless no queue when we checked in, it was around 9pm. We got upgraded to a club room, we were on our honeymoon so thought this is a nice touch. Room was lovely and spacious, everything we needed for our 2 night stay. All staff were extremly friend;y and professional, considering how big this hotel is, I didn't feel like a number.  Breakfast once again busy however a good variety and staff were not showing their stress. Pool is why everyone stays here, I could stay up there forever. It is truly amazing and memorable!  Wifi excellent We had a late flight so had a…",5,
"It was a lovely experience at MBS though it was just a short 2D1N staycation. Even though there was a queue for check in, it was a smooth wait as the staff at the counters and lobby were very efficient in clearing the queue.. We managed to get our room by the standard check in time at 3pm and was given a room on a really high floor and city view..   The room was extremely spacious and beautiful. Needless to say the highlight was the infinity pool.. Which we really enjoyed.. Don't forget to dip into the jacuzzi for a relaxing session!   I'm thankful for all the nice staffs that we met along the way in the hotel, they were all very nice, smiley, friendly and promptly acknowledges the presence of guests.   We ordered room service at night as we thought it'll be a better way to be…",5,
"The room & its view were fine, as were the facilities.  The rooftop gives a great view and the restaurant is a pleasant experience.  The only drawback of staying at this hotel are the crowds at the ground floor.",3,
Nice hotel with great location and great infinity pool (thousands of selfies) but you pay for the privilage of these experiences- rooms were ok but for the price we expected something more. Nothing special was provided for our honeymoon unlike other hotels we stayed at during our travels. Service in the executive club was excellent although if you are going up for cocktail hour its worth getting there early or you could miss out as it gets crowded.,4,
"We didn't stay at the hotel, but went for a walk through the foyer and the shops.  Not as impressive as I thought it would be, but I didn't see the actual accommodation.  Based on first impressions from the outside, it is amazing.  If the foyer and entrance were the promotional photos I would not think twice about staying somewhere else.  ",3,
"I visit Singapore monthly, from Brisbane, and always stay at the Ritz Carlton.  However, for the first time, last week I chose to stay at the MBS.  Where do I begin?  The rooms are small and average, with no splendor that the exterior of the building represents.  The hotel is so immense, with so many people staying, the staff are all run off their feet, and as such aren't as welcoming as one would expect in Singapore.  Because so many people are in residence, the queue's to check in and check out are unbearable.  At my time of check in, I had been waiting for 30 minutes before I was serviced.  At check out, only because I extended my stay till 6pm (at the cost of half a days room rate - which the Ritz Carlton generally do for free) did my check out take less than 15 minutes. …",1,
We went to maldives for honeymoon and it was magical. We made plans to stay in singapore for additional 3 nights before going home and we were so excited to stay at Marina Bay Sands for it really looks marvelous on photos. We were extra excited to see the iconic infinity pool. But everything was a disappointment from the moment we arrived.   We stayed in a suite and it was ok. Nothing great. But the view was nice. The most frustrating part for us is Club 55 which was suppose to be exclusive for guests staying in club rooms ans suites. It was too crowded with a long line of people  waiting for a table. It was the same scenario the next day for breakfast. The only positive thing i can say about this place are the kind filipino staff who were very apologetic and accommodating. This…,1,
Nice room with complete ame6nities. Too noisy on weekends and the suite room is very very spacious.  good for big group family gathering. The view from room is nice if you ask for the garden view. toilet areas are spacious with dry n wet area. well compartmentalised. very pricey stay but just got to experience it.,4,
"A normal 5-star hotel with one of the best views in Singapore and an iconic & classic infinity pool.  Value for money only if you spend a lot of time on the top, in the pool or sunbathing. Breakfast spread is huge and covers a lot of cuisines. Prefer high floor rooms for better view.",4,
"This is one of the best places in Singapore to stay for business or leisure with almost every amenity you can think of including Pubs, Restaurants, Shopping, Casinos, Convention centre etc. Well connected with Metro however the experience during recent trade show was a bit disappointing. Incase you are arriving before 12 Noon, make sure to check if they can let you check-in early or else it can be a long wait before the room is assigned. With three towers, it's a bit confusing to find your room in first place in absence of proper signage and there is not much help available from any staff guiding in case you are lost. Excellent city view from rooms at higher floors. Swimming Pool and Night club on roof top (Spago) on 57th Floor is a must visit while you are there. Overall…",4,
"The room we had was amazing, I recommend to ask for a room with a city view on a high floor. Pool area and views amazing worth the money. I was disappointed with the Concierge though, you pay all that money and they didn't seem to know much at all.   I asked for a suggestion of a nice breakfast place for my birthday, he had no idea. I dont feel like thats a hard question. I kept saying i want somewhere nice not in a shopping centre he had a look on his computer and recommended a beach club on Sentosa Island he looked up if it was open and said it was. So we travelled all the way there and they dont do breakfast week days, i feel that a concierge of a luxury hotel as such should know things like this, i had a really disappointing morning.",5,
"C'la vie restaurant: a wonderful view, but with the worst service experience in Singapore, the staff makes you feel not welcome bringing the bill every 5 minutes. Do not go there!  The hotel is ok, but the service is poor! The pool is incredible!!!!!! ",3,
"We stayed here end of last year in a club room because when you're in Singapore... why not! Reading some of the previous comments before leaving made us second guess our choice. The whole environment of the building is quite intense as it is a tourist destination there is always so much people around. With that in mind we expected it to be painful to check in. However, once we got there someone greeted us, took our bags and showed us to the check in counter, we didn't even wait in line for long. Our room was ready by 2pm and our room was amazing! It was spacious, clean and we had a wonderful view of the gardens.  The infinity pool is postcard perfect and the great part is there is a section for kids and a section for adults only, which is a bonus.  We had breakfast, canapés and…",5,
"The hotel is a bit pricey compared to its counterparts but I can tell you that it is really worth every penny. Days before our stay, they sent me a reminder. The day before, they sent me a message asking me for my preferred bed to make checking in faster. Upon check-in, their staff were all very cordial and friendly especially Ms Cheryl. They were able to accommodate my requests and they were very effiecient. The housekeeping guys were also commendable, they showed respect and expertise in what they do. Our room was simple but very well-maintained. The size and lay-out were perfect. The infinity pool was clean and of course the view up there was fantastic. My niece cannot get enough of the pool.  The location of the hotel is very strategic, accessible to all sorts of…",5,
"Go with the city view, its one you shouldnt miss if you're lucky you'll get a room on one of the higher floors, service is great and that swimming pool is to die for albeit a little crowded at times but thats pretty normal given the views you can take in from up there. A bit pricey and the foodcourt at the shoppes wasnt great didnt find much, but dintaifung n toastbox are good options if you're looking for eating options nearby. Shopping at the shoppes is another pricey experience, you'll have to hit downtown for fast fashion items as most of the brands are high end luxury ones. Only downside to my stay is the rooms are starting to look dated, the door handle to the bathroom has started to rust, other than that it was a very pleasant stay, ill b back.",4,
"Attracted by the landmark view of this hotel we booked this for 2 nights for an event and combination of an exhibition at the Marina Bay Centre. When entering (Tower 1) the huge lobby is overwhelming spacious. Check-inn went fast, but I never understand why a receptionist has to enter so much data (manually) when they already have the complete booking digital.   We had one on the less expensive rooms overlooking the park. Even though it was quite expensive and a breakfast cost and extra S$50,= Yes it is a great breakfast, but still overpriced. You can do better, can't you?   The hotel attraction is the rooftop pool which compensates a lot. Swimming in an Olympic size pool overlooking Singapore gives you a great feeling. Therefore extraordinary.   Within a few years the hotel is…",4,
"The bad: We booked MBS with high expectations and paid around 800SGD for a suite in level 3. To check in, you have to wait in a queue and it was like waiting for the mrt in the morning. Counter staff were rude and I am wandering if they were given proper training at all. If the hotel is expecting large number of people , they should be ready to handle them. Came across some security people at the lobby and they were extremly rude and didn't even know how to talk. Some way or the other we checked in to the room and waned to open the mini fridge to store a cake we had brought in to celebrate my friends bday. Then only we got to know you have to deposit 200SGD at the check in counter if you need to open the fridge door. This is the first time we come across a scenarios like this in…",1,
We stayed 3 nights end of May 2016 we loved it we had a club room and its worth the extra to have a city view - although the view of the gardens is nothing to complain about either. The service is exceptional from the minute we were helped out of our taxi to being ushered in to a lounge area to have a sit down check in with refreshments. The rooms were immaculate and spacious with everything you'd need. The pool was every bit as spectacular as pictures and the internet portray it to be. We were pinching ourselves with the breathtaking views. The pool service was excellent - very easy to spend the day drinking cocktails - the pina colada was yum and served in a coconut hooray!!   The nightly laser show is free and worth watching and do go see the gardens and get night shots too.…,5,
"Great hotel with unforgettable views over the Gardens by the bay. One of the hotel exits leads directly to the Gardens. The room was spacious, clean and quite. Very large and comfortable bed.  The swimming pool on the 57th floor is awesome. The entrance to the pool is available for hotel guests only. In the evening and in the morning the pool was a bit crowdy. The best time to go to the swimming pool (to swim/relax/take pictures) is between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Make sure you use a sun protection cream (our shoulders got burned while we were enjoying the pool). Me and my husband had a wedding anniversary (notified the hotel beforehand) and were pleasantly surprised when in the evening the hotel management sent us a piece of cake on this occasion.    The check-in and check-out were…",5,
"That infinity pool. One of the big drawcards of the hotel, and yes it is as amazing as advertised. The room in itself is not that special and for me the bed and pillow was not that comfortable but the great view at the balcony makes up for it. highly recommended ",5,
The best place to sit back and enjoy the Singapore skyline after spending an entire day at the hotel conference center. This truly is the flagship of Singapore. Prices are a bit expensive but with views like this it is worth it. ,4,
"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore is a fabulous 5 star hotel with amazing restaurants within it and within the attached shopping centre. The rooms are modern, spacious, clean with great views of the City or the Sea. The service from the staff is very good. However it's the overall service levels that let it down. Due to its sheer size and scale there are thousands of people walking through and using the hotel/restaurant facilities. And there lies the problem - never have I had to queue so much in any hotel over the last 8 years for the concierge, to check out or to have breakfast. Staying in a 5 star hotel I don't expect to queue to get seated for breakfast for over 10 minutes every morning of my 5 night stay. That's why I feel the hotel has a conflicted personality - 5…",3,
"Nice venue, great ambience and shops etc. very big to walk around. I was surprised about the room size - they are very big. Did not expect that. Big plus!  Very close and walki g distance to the supertrees which looks amazing in the night. Perfect location to go around.  ",4,
"First time to stay in one of the suites of Marina Bay Sands and I must say, its all about the view! It's breathtaking! Our suite room 5199 has its own gym, sauna, massage room, kitchen, dining room and karaoke room! It was such a happy experience for my teenagers specially to my youngest who celebrated his birthday. The skypark pool has 3 divisions, the 2nd one as a lap pool from 6am-8am. It's a little crowded in the afternoon. The buffet breakfast at the Rise restaurant is ok..",4,
"Visited with friends on the last night of our trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Our room was upgraded and in spectacular fashion.  Instead of the two club  rooms we'd booked we were escorted to a 2 bedroom suite with floor to ceiling windows which offered a magnificent view both day and night of the city, a baby grand piano, media room and more.  The club room (Club55) offers afternoon tea and also 2 hours of canapes and drinks in the evening, the standard of the food was excellent.  Every staff member we encountered was genuinely warm, friendly and helpful.",5,
"This hotel is the architectural equivalent of pure excitement. We spent two nights at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore during our first visit to this very captivating asian city. Of course the reasons were the infinity rooftop pool and the location of the hotel. On arrival the check in assistant used his magic to organize a room on the 35th floor with views of the Gardens by the bay and the huge ships near the shore waiting to get loaded or unloaded. Stunning views, indeed. The entire experience breathes luxury, but of course the highlight is the time you spend on the rooftop, especially in the pool, floating towards the edge and into the Singapore skyline. This pleasure is reserved for hotel guests so you feel even more spoiled. Of course this has its price, but it is with it,…",5,
It awesome one but check in process is time consuming so it take to time and breakfast is good for indian also  And swing pool is good and lift is good  And all staff is good  but wifi is good and all room is good view is best and when you go at this hotel go before time bcoz in chek in process is not a fast so go and enjoy ,4,
"What I Loved: 1.  The room was really big 2.  Beautiful view of the bay area 3.  Lots of plugs for all the gadgets 4.  Soft Bed and Pillows 5.  Everything looked new 6.  THE AMAZING POOL!!!   Granted there were a lot of people until closing time.  But if you wake up really early like at 6am and head to the pool, I guarantee that you will be able to take shots without people around to photobomb you. 7.  Food tastes really good 8.  Mall is super near and very convenient to go down and grab something to eat or to shop or to hang out in the outdoor bars.  A must if you have the chance to splurge!",5,
"We stayed here as a treat on our last night in Singapore and are so glad we did! The service is second to none, and the views are just incredible.  The hotel lobby is very busy however it was easy to locate the check in desk. There was a queue for check in but this moved quickly as there were several staff working the desk. Staff allowed us to check in an hour and a half before our designated time, which meant more time at the pool!  Our room on the 44th floor was incredible, more like a suite really, and the bathroom was huge! We had a view right out over the bay which was amazing.  Staff knew we were on our honeymoon so had decorated the bed and put rose petals in the bath. They also brought us some chocolates which was very nice of them!  Then to the infinity pool - just wow!…",5,
We are 3 friends and were enjoying the pool today. After some diving with open eyes we all 3 had serious pain in our eyes.  Now after 6 hours we still have pain and blurry sight.   Seems the adjustment of chlorine and ph value is very wrong today. How can a Hotel like this have health risking water in the pool. We took probes of the water now. Let's see when the eye problems will be gone.,1,
"The hotel is over hyped and is a waste of money if you choose to stay. However, the only positive thing is that the Terrace Bar gives great view of the city. A nice evening spent over a few drinks helps you to unwind. A bit expensive but you dont mind paying considering the location n the view :)",4,
"Absolutely everything thought of, with no corners cut! Outstanding service by Daniel at the sky park, like he genuinely cared how our stay was, and cared about us! This place is a must go. Ps thanks for the upgrade to the suite,  will definitely be back!!",5,
"This is a massive, mega hotel and complex.  Pristine - like everything in Singapore - this is not the place to stay if you like boutique hotels or small hidden gems.  That said, we loved our experience.  We stayed in a suite that was corporate - no real character or warmth (not even a painting on the wall), but we loved it.  Two bathrooms, shower that could fit about ten people, two sings in the master bath and a wonderful stand alone tub with a phenomenal view.  The best part by far was the view.  Floor to ceiling windows in the main room, bedroom, and bathroom, with views of the city and ocean that were some of the best I have ever seen in the world.  Breakfast on the 55th floor for Suite guests was wonderful (and free!).  Great selection of food, personal service (they…",5,
"During a recent trip to Singapore, we stayed in a different hotel for the first part of our trip, but then decided to stay in Marina Bay Sands for our last night – and boy are we glad that we did! The hotel is probably the most iconic building in the whole of Singapore – designed on the appearance of a deck of cards and looks magnificent – especially at night!  The hotel is at the heart of Marina Bay and cannot be missed. It is on the Marina, surrounded by a huge 3 story shopping centre, and large Casino underneath!   The hotel lobby is absolutely huge with various cafes and restaurants, but thankfully just the single check-in desk! Three is also a separate desk just for check-outs. Check-in was a breeze and we were given a room with a view of the Marina – which was absolutely…",5,
"I recently stayed for 3 nights at the MBS. The hotel was ok, my room average. BUT i had the best experience on the infinity pool. An amazing pool staff named ""Dax Taparan"" made my remarkable! Dax was SUPER professional and caring, tailoring and any of my needs, with a big smile and dedication. The pool was packed but still I felt like the centre of attention. Because of Dax I will be back to this Hotel.  Thank you Dax",5,
"We haven't been to Singapore for over 20 years.  I did my usual research and found a bunch of hotels that would be amazing but I kept going back to the Marina Bay Sands just because it is a one off and an iconic landmark in Singapore which didn't exist when we were last there.  We had a super cheap week in Thailand first but bit the bullet and booked an Orchid Suite for 3 nights with club privileges and an airport limo pickup to finish off.  We were met  by our hostess as the car pulled up and the door opened. Wow.  Not cheap but on world luxury hotel standards it did not disappoint, in fact it was a first for us.  We were personally escorted to our beautiful spacious suite by our hostess and her colleague.  We enjoyed an exclusive check-in in our suite with cool towels and…",4,
"We stayed there for 3 Nights last 2013 on Premier Room with City view Nr. 2654. See Foto. Room flooring was carpeted and clean. Bad is also spacious. For my Opinion, outside its the architecture that makes different from the other and inside its just a normal huge hotel with Casino sorrounded from small to luxurious Shops and Food Courts.  The infinity Pool in 55th Floor is absolutely the Highlight. Thats why i will probably book again but just for a Night or 2. Swissotel Stamford is rather higher.   ",4,
I had great expectations for this stay. Recently I stayed at The Star Sydney and was wowed! For the same level I was expecting to be blown away by this hotel. I was overwhelmed at how overrated this hotel is...  * The hotel - the hotel its self is amazing. It is large so be prepared for a walk. The service staff at front desk were fabulous. Everywhere else left a lot to the imagination. Trying to get over the road to the Gardens by the bay is an effort and you go in a lift so hot you think its how your life is going to end. The wifi is good but the minute you check out is disconnected and the free wifi is unusable. They do not offer late check outs for later flights but you can go up to the gym and have a shower if you get a pass.  * The room - the room is lacking in modern…,3,
"Stayed here for 3 days with my family. The location is great! Close to the Metro underground, near the Marina Bay Gardens and park. Food is excellent with a lot of restaurants and shops.  The view at the top floor is amazing. My kids had fun in the pool at the top deck! Would definitely stay here again.",5,
"Stayed here for 2 nights in March and loved it! The views from the bedroom and the infinity pool are beautiful and it is conveniently located near the stunning shopping centre with easy access to the station. Even if you don't stay the night, I would recommend getting a day pass and checking out the views from the top. Also, I loved the spa facilities and the hot pool. ",5,
This hotel is must visit and if possible and a must stay if you can. We stayed in the club rooms of the hotel on the 45th floor with city view. It was just mindblowing. Had a separate check ins for club room and suites. So it was quite and smooth. we check in 3 hours early and hotel was really sweet to not make us wait. This gesture will surely make me come back again. Its a destinations in itself.,5,
"what a hotel...three tower ,, infinity pool...bar, clubs,,,restaurants..everything was beyond expectation...we are with group here.. had great time in infinity pool..late night swimming... than casino... no time fro sleep...roods are very big & with awesome view...",5,
"This was an amazing and unforgettable hotel stay.  The hotel is beautiful and in a great location not far from the airport.  The views are spectacular, especially from their famous rooftop infinity edge pool.  Didn't eat at the hotel because it was rather pricey and there are fantastic restaurants, including the world's best street food, walking distance from the hotel.  The shops were fantastic and it had an awesome food court that mimicked the famous hawker centres.  We stayed in an Orchid suite which included breakfast and afternoon drinks on the 57th floor.  The room was spacious, well appointed, and had an amazing view.  We will definitely be returning to Singapore and I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.",5,
"Nothing to complain about with this hotel, the service was efficient, the rooms were nice and a good size, the only downside is that it is a very big hotel and feels more like a busy train station than a 5-star hotel. The lobby is constantly heaving with people, there is quite often a queue for the lifts, you don't recognise any of the staff as they change so often, etc. So if you are looking for a nice place, with a good location, and nice rooms, this is great; if you are looking for a more special hotel experience this is not it.",4,
"Marina Bay Sands is iconic because of its outstanding architecture and infinity pool, including the wonderful gardens on one side of the hotel and the amazing shopping mall linked to the hotel. This is what attracted me to the hotel in the first place. However, service problems were evident from the reality of my arrival at check-in. The check-in queue was overwhelming. It felt like checking in for a flight. It took long. Reason given by the hotel was that it was a public holiday. Surely, management should be prepared for the numbers of guests in good time to allocate sufficient staff to deal with this busy period?  My room was not ready at 3pm and consequently it was only ready almost 2 hours later. The hotel management gave me a remarkable upgrade to a lavish suite as a…",3,
"The service was amazing and the hotel itself is in a really good location, very central. My room was upgraded and I really enjoyed my birthday celebration here as they provided a free slice of cake. Be careful of the mist as it it hard to get a good view of the city from the infinity pool.",4,
"Been here in my bday , they give me city view room which is the compliment ...also later on send me choco bday cake..thanks to Sena, one of the receptionist... Our room is awesome.. Baby crib had big enough size so that my baby can play inside Location near some attractions such as garden by the bay and clarke quaey  Definetely will come back here Please give more offer compliment if we want to stay here longer  ",5,

"We checked in the day after my husbands birthday and having seen our passports, we were upgraded to a suite on the 52nd floor overlooking Gardens by the Bay and the water. It was AMAZING! My husband even had a complimentary birthday cake delivered which was really nice!  The room was enough on its own, then experiencing the views from the pool! It's definitely a once in a lifetime experience that I'm glad we splurged for our 1 night stay in Singapore.  The shops and museum were great to explore during the day while we awaited our late night flight, we were able to store our bags at Marina Bay for the day with no extra charge.  It definitely lived up to its reputation of being a class of its own hotel! ",5,
"We were totally blown away again, my husband and I have stayed here three times before and every time is more amazing than ever. This visit was to celebrate our friends anniversary. Thank you to all the staff who were so attentive and made us feel so welcome. A very big special thank you to Wangelin Sum for making our stay amazing, personal, and very memorable, we all felt like royalty and I am so glad we had the chance to meet you. We will return and I will continue to recommend everyone I know to stay at this incredible hotel. Thank you again Wangelin and all the staff at MBS. ",5,
"We stayed at MBS for one (last) night of our winter holiday. The place is huge and it really feels like a train station with long queus at the reception desks. Lots of people come and go at every hour - many come just for one night (to be able to enjoy the magnificent pool). The room is big and cosy and the terrace is spectacular, if I had a chaise-longue I would have probably slept there. The view over the Gardens and the bay needs to be seen to be believed. And there's the pool...the staff is very friendly, the view AMAZING if you get over the noise of the excitement everyone is experiencing. Some kids manage to get into the adult area and spoil your mojo, but the staff is very attentive and will send them away. The drinks are very expensive, but you are probably used to it if…",4,
"Stayed at this amazing hotel for 4 nights before going to Bali. Amazing restaurants and shops, very helpful stuff. The breakfast & afternoon snack at club 55 was out of this world. Awesome View from the infinity pool. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Highly recommended.",5,
"Well...where do I start! From the moment we walked in we could see we were going to enjoy all this luxury.  This was a special treat due to illness so It couldn't have been better.  Check in was friendly & efficient, although our room wasn't ready as it was only 1.30pm.  They gave us temporary keys so we could still check out the whole hotel, & told us to come back in one hour.  After this time it seemed we were slightly upgraded as our club room 4771 on (47th floor) was larger & more luxurious than we could have imagined & much better than most of the pictures on the site.  The room  looked straight out at the city area with the water below so we were able to watch the nightly laser show from our massive windows.  The bed was so king size & comfy, plenty of pillows & lovely…",5,

Probably amongst the best hotels with a mammoth rooftop pool. The view of the city whilst swimming is awesome. The rooms and the service is exclusive. The only negative is the hotel reception lobby which is always so crowded it feels like a railway platform.,5,
"Stayed at suite 54th floor. Luxurious and huge room with access to skybar and infinity pool. After a hot day afternoon, requested for more bottled water through room service but was asked to pay extra $4S for ea bottle after 2 supplied free. OOps! Never heard of that I said. No apologies after that but was handed 2-4 bottles each day. Bathroom, toilet were not cleaned properly with long hair on floor. called room service again and they spent some time cleaning. All the staff were exceptionally polite and helpful providing excellent service and the hotel -- beautiful and huge. Huge shopping and good food court down stair.

"My new wife and I started our honeymoon at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, booking in to a standard room with a city view. After a 16 hour flight from the UK we arrived in Singapore and began our transfer to this incredible hotel. After initially being amazed by the architecture and sheer size of this behemoth we arrived at reception and immediately had our checked bags taken from us by a very polite porter. Check in followed, where the lovely receptionist noticed both our new wedding rings and 'just married' baggage tags. She, without hesitation, jumped straight on the phone and upgraded us to the most outstanding hotel room I've ever been in; a 3 room Orchid Suite on the 53rd floor over looking the city which included free champagne, breakfast, afternoon tea and canapés.

of course it was amazing and expenisve but we had to come here at least for one night before residing in koh phangan for 4 month. the view and the pool is breath-taking wile everybody is super friendly and all super clean and all super super super.......but love my tree house over all.,5,
"Stayed 2 nights on a business trip. The hotel was new, modern, clean, with luxury fixtures. Got upgrade to a very large room with stunning Bay view and city skyline on high floor. (Note that standard room would be a pretty normal in size). Overall it's a great iconic newer hotel in Singapore, good place for comfort, luxury, & view.   Some drawback: Due to size, it feels somewhat impersonal. Room decor was a bit cold. No complementary fruit basket or the like.  Rooftop pool, supposed to be exclusive for guests, was overly crowded to be anywhere near exclusive. The gigantic mall with casino connected to hotel was mainly full of expensive brandnames, not fun to walk. Not even starbucks or casual coffee shops there.   ",4,
"This is my second stay in the MBS hotel. I am coming to Singapore very frequently, but the hotel is most of the tome fully booked or just unbelievable expensive.  For business trips it is a hotel you should have experienced once in your life. Unfortunately most of the things that make this hotel so special, if you are working during daytime. The infinity pool is the highlight. Breakfast is not included in the room rate. The BF buffet is 50S$. Due to its location you very much depend on taxi and/or public transportation. I usually go to Orchard Road for dinner and this is about 10-15 minutes away by taxi (15S$). I would suggest to stay there on the way to your final destination for a max of 2 days.

"If you are a luxury traveller or you are someone who believes in then this hotel is definitely an experience in itself  Why should you be here?  To swim on top of the world. Yes, to experience the stunning infinity pool and ofcourse to stay at one of the most spectacular hotel in Singapore. It’s known to be one of the most iconic attraction of the Lion City. However, the opportunity to swim at the infinity pool is only open to hotel guests but then there’s a way to do it. Read on to find more.  What is it about the stay?  Let me explain in simple words. If Venetian is to Macau, then Marina Bay is to Singapore.  There are several reasons why this property is worth a stay atleast two nights:  To experience the grandeur. It’s 57 storey megastructure consist of 3 towers, connected…",5,
Excellent property for Luxury travelers. You name the service and they have it. Purely 7 star accommodation with all facilities included. Great view of the city from the hotel and they have the world best casino too.,5,
"Cannot recommend this hotel enough, we stayed for one night during a stop over to Bali and wish we had stayed longer. The swimming pool is a must see as it overlooks the city but is even more stunning in the evening when its dark. We enjoyed the cocktails and bar food around the pool and had absolutely no complaints about our stay. The casino and shopping mall attached to the hotel were great to look around although we had little time to explore properly. The room was very comfortable and we loved the décor. Nothing felt cheap. Our friends had a room much higher up than ours, they had an amazing view from up there but if you don't like heights, I would stay in a room closer to the ground! Faultless stay at Marina.",5,
"I travelled with my family and this hotel got a spacious room but unfortunately this hotel was pretty far from city centre. The view and the infinity pool were also great but not worth the price. I also travelled here a couple years ago at holiday season and the service was not so great. This hotel also connected to a mall and it was great if you like to shop for an exclusive brand. They have a cool water show, best spot to watch new year's eve fireworks, and it's also close to art-science museum and gardens by the bay. ",3,
"Very much a casino hotel, huge with no personal service or attention.  We had a huge suite on one of the highest floors overlooking the city, great views, but the room felt under furnished and cheap.    The property has some excellent restaurants, Spago was a favourite.  The sky pool is nice but gets far too busy between 4-8.  It's like a zoo with bodies fighting to take selfies with their sticks.  Well worth a short visit, but go with lowered expectations.",3,
"This is a much overhyped hotel. I always thought the architecture was ugly but that it would be better from the inside looking out. Not so. the hotel lobby is vast, impersonal and a public throughway. The rooms are nice enough, and big enough, but cold and impersonal. The pool looks great from above, but under the water is a murky soup of bits of old tissue and other unidentifiable bits - it is absolutely filthy. The staff are well trained and pleasant but not a patch on most. We have stayed at 'classic' hotels including the Fullarton and Raffles in Singapore and MBS is nothing like them, despite being close in price. We couldn't even get complementary milk for a cup of tea! Overall I gained the impression that we are not the customer profile and demographic they seek.",3,
"The Marina Bay Sands, is a BUSY hotel. There are tons of people walking through the lobby in the mall, and at the pool. Overall, felt like the actual hotel room was fine and had a nice view of the gardens by the bay, which was the best part about it. For some reason the porch didn't have any porch furniture on it which I thought was a little weird, and would have liked so we could sit out on the porch and enjoy the nice view. The room itself was nice but kind of of small, we were traveling with our two small kids, so had a crib and rollaway bed in the room as well, which didn't leave a lot of space for movement. (We had a king bed room as they told us they didn't do rooms with two double beds which tends to be more standard in the places we've traveled.) The pool views are…",4,
"We only had one night at this amazing hotel but we certainly tried to make the most of it!  We had a drink at the roof top bar, swam in the roof top infinity pool with drinks poolside and enjoyed the magnificent view of the city from our spacious, luxurious room on the 34th floor!  The soaker tub in the bathroom was such a delightful way to relax.  We will ensure that we have more time to enjoy on our next visit.  The staff were all very helpful and welcoming.  So glad we booked!",5,
City view rooms are awesome .... service good .. rooms spacious ... infinity pool ...the main attraction of marina bay is good but nothing grt about it except the fact that its on 57th floor... lobby is shabby... no place to sit as its always full.... but lobby apart everything else was very nice ... ,5,
"Yes, it is a pricey place to stay, but, we thoroughly enjoyed the infinity pool on the roof as well as we had a wonderful dinner at Ce La Vi also on the roof.  Fantastic views and great service, although it took a bit of time to get our champagne while lounging in the pool.  The pool area is super busy, but, there are people coming and going all the time so a bit of patience will land you a couple of loungers.  Our room was spacious on the 37th floor with a view to the harbour.  This was amazing since you couldn't see the anchored ships from the land level.  There must have been 100's of them out there.  The sunrise was worth getting up for.  The photos I took just don't do it justice.  The hotel service was fine, but, the line ups to check in and check out take way too long.  I…",5,
"My husband and I spent one night in this really grand hotel on our honeymoon. Because the honeymoon the hotel uppgraded our club room to suite for free. The suite was perfect and we were so amazed! The staff was really professional and super polite . The gym was good, easy to do basic workout. Breakfast was so good. It had everything in it that we could possibly want. The price is high but it is really worth it!",5,
"The hotel was comfortable and well appointed.  The Infinity Pool was a nice infinity pool.  I'm glad to say I have stayed here, but I doubt I will book again.  I've been in a number of better five stars hotels and quite a few four star hotels I enjoyed more.  Given what they charge for a room, you expect to have your socks blown off.  The hotel was good, but my socks stayed on my feet.",3,
"Simple rehash of things you've already read about via other reviews:  - Only people staying at the hotel can use the infinity pool. - Go to the infinity pool at 6am when it opens; during the day it's a zoo. - Room service food is not too bad; I preferred it to the very expensive restaurants. - There is a food court at the end of the shopping plaza where you can buy really cheap meals; it's chaotic with tons of people but pretty good food. - Casino is free to enter for foreigners, just bring your passport. - Gardens by the Bay - $8 for the Skywalk, $28 for both domes (the Cloud dome is very cold, nice respite to the hot and humid temps outside). - Subway is downstairs and convenient. - I somehow got charged an 'internet' fee; in the process of figuring out what it is since the…",4,
"We only stayed here one night and I must say it was worth the visit.  We were greeted by Antonio who was amazing. he was so helpful and we were lucky to receive an upgrade. He could not be more helpful and informative - very impressive. We did pay the extra money for the Club rooms - and it was worth every penny. The view from our room was fantastic - over looking the city and the bay. rooms where spacious and very clean and comfortable. We visited the club room for afternoon tea, and of course some drinks later that evening. The view was great and staff were very friendly. The hotel has a great location and the views are quite spectacular. The Pool - what can i say - there are 3 located on the roof top and what I liked was there was a kid free pool which I must say was very…",5,

"We've been based in Singapore for 11 years, and renting property in one of the world's most expensive property markets makes us wary of any staycation. We have two kids (5 and 1 year old), so besides the $, it's the cost of disruption.   We thought long and hard booking a staycation at MBS for Robert's 40th. Very glad we did, it's worth the experience. We booked the Club Room (city view); as residents, our game plan was to maximise the hotel (room and pool), and the Club Room gives access to Club 55 (afternoon tea and evening cocktails, in addition to breakfast)  1. Check-in/check-out process - 3 out of 5 stars. To start with, check-in time is 3pm, and check-out is 11am. That's less than 24 hours! I know most hotels have these times, but what put me off was (1) not being given a…",4,
"Having previously admired this amazing hotel from many sites around Singapore, we booked two nights as a stopover enroute home after our 6 week holiday in the UK to relax and experience first hand the hotel. From the moment of arrival by taxi, staff attended to our luggage, staff at check in were nothing less than exceptional in their level of service. We arrived on the 41st floor and on opening the room the curtains automatically opended unveiling the spectacular floor to ceiling view of the City and Marina Bay. The room was spacious with plenty of seating, a huge bathroom, plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. But of course it did not stop there, I recall gasping at the view from the Skypool of course taking the plunge to infinity. We enjoyed dinner at the Ce La Vie restaurant,…",5,
"I have been living in Spore for close to a decade. And since my bf was in town. We decided to have a staycation in MBS. The reception upgraded us to a suites with city view (we booked premier room with garden view). The service all the way was  much more than expected. The room service attended like immediately. The express tele service was so polite. Being enjoying the pool and night club, since I am a member, we had dinner at RISE. They helped me surprise my bf for his birthday and he loved it so much. MBS cared for the customers until they check out. Wonderful experience. Their service really outstands the others.",5,
"This is by far the most iconic hotel in Singapore, and maybe one of the most iconics in the world. It is hard to search other hotel options in Singapore because you always feel influenced and tempted (if the budget allows) to stay there due to the magical views and to the pool. Of course, as first timers visiting the city, me and my wife, on behalf of of our delight, (""once in Singapore, we had to stay there'!) didnt choose any different than that. Therefore, we accepted to take the pricey club room option, getting a nice and ample habitation located just at the upper floors in tower 2 (the central tower) with gardens by the bay/ocean views and full access to the vip executive lounge, which included 3 meals per day (breakfast, afternoon tea and a pre dinner snack set (with…",4,
Great central location for walking around. The Concierge was very helpful with advice on tourist attractions and other places. SkyPark Observation Deck is always a delight as it was my 3rd time stay there :),5,
"We were on a short stopover and trained into the CBD from Changi.  Had to change trains 4 times, but, its still a good service and Singapore does signs pretty well.  Arrived and did the sight seeing, amazing parks and attractions. Went to the hotel lobby for lunch and it is the most amazing lobby I have ever seen from 6 stories up.  Very busy, but very large and great food and drink. Perfect for the weary traveler. To say it is popular is an understatement.  We are going to go back and stay, and spend a day on the amazing roof.  A hotel not to be missed, and next time we go to Asia, we are stopping over on the way there and back, and staying here..",5,
"This is the best hotel in the city, very well located and with one the best infinity pool of the world. The staff is very helpful and you also have more than4 restaurants, 3 bars at the top and goes straight to the casino",5,
"After having spent a whole week in downtown Singapore we decided to get some luxury for the last night. Marina Bay Sands was the obvious choice - mostly also because of the allegedly great view from the pool.   We have not been disappointed. The rooms (we booked 3) all were above our expectations - great view on both the city and the gardens with all the amenities you would be looking for in a hotel of this category.  I would definitely recommend staying at this place for one night - for the sake of visiting the pool and sipping a singapore sling on the rooftop bar alone.   I would however rather save my money and spend it elsewhere in case I needed an accommodation for more than one night. Don't get me wrong, the staff is very friendly and kind in general, but since the hotel…",4,
"Stayed for 1 night at Marina Bay Sands in order to experience the Skypool. This place didn't disappoint. This is an incredibly luxurious hotel, upon arrival I was originally offered a room on the 3rd floor, but pressed for a higher level and was provided with a 35th floor room. I'm so glad that I asked for a higher floor as one ofthe highlights was entering your room and having the curtains open to show a wonderful view of the city. The Skypool is everything you can imagine. It is expansive, and the view is spectacular. Although I only stayed for 1 night, I was able to take advantage of the pool area twice. The Shoppes at MBS are mainly luxury brands but there are some more affordable brands on show as well. The food court is much more expensive than similar food courts in…",5,
"It was just one night stay (too bad though) I may miss lots of better part of this hotel.  We were very lucky to get upgrade to the club floor. City view from high floor was amazing. I heard it was full house but our room was nicely ready before check-in time. We had in room check-in & out. Thank you Mr. Ramesh. It's always great pleasure to have in room check-in especially with sophisticated manner assistance.   When you stay MSB, must try the infinity pool. it's open early morning to night. my recommendation is the early morning or night. Looking over the whole city of Singapore from sky high with morning fresh air is something special you can't get so often. In the night, definitely beautiful!!  I would also recommend staying at the club floor. the view from lounge was also…",5,

Gerry and Phillip were absolutely wonderful.  The service and hospitality were outstanding ! Both gentlemen went out of their way that our dinner- chef's 9 course meal was superb! The presentation and the knowledge of the food with the pairing was most enjoyable! A memory my husband and I will never forget! Thank You Gerry and Phillip - Job well done! We felt like family ! We will be back!!,5,
"The hotel is very big, consists of 3 towers. In term of service, it is average, no personalization whatsoever, I guess because it's a very busy and packed hotel. Room style and decor is also just ok. I would only come back for the infinity pool.",4,

"We booked The Club Room upgrade and it was worth it!. The complimentary afternoon tea and canapés was more food then we could handle and the view from Club 55 was mesmerising. Our room was huge - looked over the city. The staff at Club 55 are world class, they remembered our name after the first day! We stayed here for 2 nights as a treat but I think it has ruined me, simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in - EVER.",5,
"We stayed here for my birthday and we were very pleased with the service we received during our stay. Spago made my birthday breakfast so special and so did the staff at the pool. The rooms are nice, very large with a good bathtub and shower. The city views are spectacular. We were on the 41st floor. The pool is everything you could hope for....it's crowded but worth it. Try to be there around 6:00 for the start of sunset which is around 6:45 pm. A great time for photos! The only negative was the MASSIVE amount of crowds in the hotel. Not a romantic location but great for families or when traveling as a group. It's one of those must stay hotels....at least once for the pool view and city view from the rooms.",4,
"This Hotel is exactly what we expected. A true 5 star experience!!! Helpful staff where ever you turn, within the hotel lobby/ concierge area, mind you this area expands across the bottom of three towers! Rooms are spotless and Very well maintained and cleaned while you are out. The adjoining Shopping centre with all of the luxury brands at your feet! The MRT is perfectly positioned for efficient travel across Singapore. The infinity Pool is a Must! Worth every cent",5,
"The Marina Bay Sands is where you want to stay if you never want to leave the hotel.  Great clubs, restaurants, the amazing rooftop infinity pool, large rooms and suites, and amazing views from almost any room.  I've stayed a few times now and it's awesome.  The only downside are both the guest tourists and the random people that walk through the hotel sightseeing.  It can seem overly busy at times.  But you can avoid most of this if you know the hotel well enough.",4,
"For my last night in Singapore, I checked into MBS to make the most of the infinity pool right at the top of the hotel and to end my holiday on a sweet note. I was not disappointed when I was guided through to my room and walked out onto the balcony with views of the Gardens By The Bay. The room and the bathroom is incredibly spacious and the décor is very luxurious. The bed was ultra comfy and it was one of the best nights sleep I've ever had.  MBS has an endless amounts of top restaurants, fantastic shops and beautiful sceneries and entertainment all around. The scale of MBS is shocking. The sky deck is nothing to write home about once you've visited the infinity pool. While the pool is very busy, it is absolutely huge that you don't ever feel crowded. Only hotel guests are…",5,

"Stayed in hotel in April 2016 in Tower 2   I had read and heard so much about this hotel,  hence during my recent business visit to Singapore opted to stay there.  The hotel is too big hence a lots of people for check in and check out at the reception all the time  My check in was fast which was done by Mr Nelson.  The room booked for me was not available , hence I was upgraded to higher category room without any charge .  The room was big and the toilet also big with good quality of toiletries .  It takes long time while coming up and down by the elevator due to the size of the hotel and the floors .  The breakfast is served on the ground floor with good quality  and variety of food .  The infinity pool is amazing with very nice view of the city. I used the pool in morning as…",4,
Excellent hotel and service. Room was a little noisy due to internal door not being sealed and neighbours were loud.  not hotel's fault but need to request a room that does not have a connecting door.  Pool area was excellent and much needed.,5,

"Before I begin, I would like to explain that this is a very beautifully designed hotel and a clear landmark for tourism in Singapore.   Upon arrival we found ourselves at the Tower 3 check-in which was fast and efficient. When asked to be placed on a higher level, we were opted to pay an additional fee which we obliged since it felt like this was a once in a lifetime stay.  When we reached the room it was handicap accessible and missing some of the amenities that a standard room would have (Bathtub). After several hours going back and forth with the front desk we were upgraded to a Premiere Room, which had I known was going to be a major improvement from a Deluxe I would have booked it prior to arrival.  Keep in mind that the pool only accepts guests who are staying at the…",4,
"We had a very good view of Gardens By The Bay from the room, just that it gets little annoying when the air conditioning shuts off automatically when the balcony door is not closed (even if its closed and not shut tight, the air conditioning fails). The room is pretty spacious and comfortable enough, but nothing absolutely outstanding.   The Infinity Pool and Sky Deck are definitely the greatest draws of MBS - we swam in the evening and morning, and really there's nowhere else you get such great views of the skyline. It does get very crowded with lots of tourists, but still possible to get a great picture. Definitely recommend chilling by the sunbeds, just people watching and having a drink and some fries.   An alternative to staying at MBS will be to have a drink at Ce La Vie,…",5,

"I consider Marina Bay Sands as the OTT (over the top) of hotels. Staying there afforded me three (3) advantages. One is the ready access to the pool at the top as well as the restaurants and bars - that was actually the prime reason why we stayed there. The pool and the view were just fantastic. 360 degrees. I went to the pool (of course I swam) during the day and at night so I could compare. Another advantage of staying in MBS is the fact that guests can get discounts from shops and stores in the shopping complex. Discount is not much though, just around 10%, but it matters somehow. Third advantage of staying in MBS is that it's a good jump off point to explore the marina area on foot. Can access the Gardens by the bay, Helix bridge, Singapore flyer, Esplanade, the Merlion…",5,
"I will acknowledge that for the size of the place and the shear magnitude of people this place needs to handle they do an exemplary job. For those of you looking for a more intimate BnB type of experience this isn't your hotel. If you love hustle and bustle, and urban chatter, you'll love it here. So much cultural variety - please talk to your neighbors at the bar or any restaurant you go to - you'll meet all sorts of interesting people from all over the world.  The roof top is unlike anything I've ever seen. Stunning vistas and of the bay, all of Singapore. Go twice during daylight and night time. It's that beautiful. Go swim in the pool!  The attached mall has everything - great food (must have the xiao long bao at Din Tai Fung, reviewed elsewhere)- and all the watch and…",4,
"A hotel that keeps to a high standard of service level. Given the vast number of rooms, do expect the high number of hotel guests in the hotel grounds, especially the infinity pool.  However, water pressure in the shower room is disappointing.",5,
"One thing about the Marina Bay Sands is that it's huge ~ massive in fact. So be prepared to walk long distances, to the mall, to the shops, or even if you are just venturing from one tower of the hotel to another (there are three). The MRT is just underneath the hotel, but again it is a fair walk there so be prepared if the MRT is your mode of transport. The lobby of the hotel is impressive~especially when you look upwards to the huge and tall skylight roof. I took one of the Orchid Suites so check in was done on a separate floor of the hotel but walking past the lobby , queues were seen at the checkin counters. Check in was efficient enough, as expected of a Sands property, with polite and helpful staff. The room was small for a suite (but then, it was an entry level suite...),…",4,
"I was excited to stay at Marina Bay Sands. At $550 per night, it was the most expensive hotel I have ever personally booked. For this room rate (which I fully appreciate is among the lowest of rates available at this particular hotel), I was expecting a higher degree of customer service. I felt that the staff made us feel like we were criminals for wanting to enjoy our stay. I have a close personal friend who lives in Singapore so I invited her to join myself and my travel companion at the famous infinity pool. This was not allowed under hotel rules (I used to live in Singapore and imagined if my parents had come to visit me and I was not allowed to come spend time with them at their hotel). Additionally, the hotel locks down all facilities after checkout at 11am (aka not able…",1,
A beautiful hotel with perfect ambiance. Service is of a high standard. The rooms are very good but lack a little bit of the Singapore touch. Overal a very good place for even a long term visit. The restaurant is of an high standard with a nice variety of foods and non foods.,5,
"Appreciate the fact that i was given an early check in. The deluxe room had a great view. And the sky park and infinity pool was awesome as promised. Room service was prompt.

Gilligan and his crew (t.v. show) are shipwrecked on an island on what was supposed to be a three-hour tour and end up being there for years. That is what Marina Bay Sands hotel was for us.   Thinking it would be a fun finish to our Bali vacation with our teenage daughter, we booked 2 nights at MBS. The package booking included tickets to CATS, a visit to the Chocolate Buffet and a swim in the iconic pool with a view on top. It was supposed to be a once-in-a -lifetime kind of thing. It was predictably spectacular. The whole experience is incredible. My teen daughter LOVED it!  She loved Singapore- even declaring ""I could live here!""

We stayed at a deluxe room but was given complimentary upgrade for club room facilities as it was my hubby's birthday.  The food at Club 55 was good esp for wine lover who can have free flow of wine and champagne from 5-7pm.  The infinity pool seems more like a selfie pool.  I rarely see people swim and it is always very crowded!  The deluxe city view room is big with fantastic view!  So nice that we slept with curtains undrawn!,5,
"Very good hotel attached to a shopping (high end) center and casino. I was struck by the high quality service from check in to check out. Housekeeping was both efficient and invisible (is there anything worse than to hear incessant knocking of housekeeping walking the halls?). Even better was the 24 hour room service. While there are many celebrity chef restaurants in the attached shopping area (Puck, Ramsay,etc), the room service menu was absolutely wonderful. And I am always extremely jet-lagged and arriving at odd times, so being open around the clock is great. ",5,
"The room and view were amazing, we managed to get into the infinity pool at 6:00am to take a couple of quick snaps. Def a must visit in Singapore if you get the chance. We had dinner at Ce La Vi and Spago for breakfast. The food was amazing I must go again",5,
"I won't deny the fact that the hotel is beautiful and the Skypark is a must. However, I have rarely spent such an uncomfortable stay in a hotel. The lobby is a mall and the receptionists are rude. The pool is beautiful but it is overcrowded and lacks ambiance. The dishes are overpriced. The Wi-Fi is quite weak and we must pay for a stronger one.  The hotel has no charm. I had the impression of staying in a big factory for wealthy people. The only reason I give this hotel 2 stars id for its facilities: the rooms are nice and the pool is impressive. The rest is more than deceiving.",2,
This place is amazing. The rooftop pool was incredible. The Sky Park is awesome. The gym is quality. The food options are solid but somewhat pricey.The location is great with easy access to mass transit. The staff is top notch.,5,
"Stayed here for 3 nights.  Its feels a lot like an airport - the queues at check in are a disgrace given what they charge.  you could be there (will be there) for 45 mins.. Its vast, but its an ICON. Lose the rage from the check in, get to your room, and then go up top.. And ITS ALL WORTH IT. Incredible views, great bars, and an infinity pool that been on countless adverts.. Service is good generally - but the restaurant queue system sucks - they make you wait 15 to 30 mins for b fast - when its half empty.. lots of faults - but - you need to stay here - so, what can I say!  luggage staff are great, taxis are cheap - and its a walk - literally to the gardens - which are worth a stroll. Its also attached to a huge mall - with great food choices and shopping.",4,
What a view from the top..spectacular..We could see the Singapore from top..it gives a different view in the night and in morning.. Would recommend all to take time out and visit this place at both the times..worth spending time for it..Singapore trip would be incomplete without seeing this.,4,
"I booked a room in MBS because it was convenient for me to attend an event at the Sands Ballroom. The location of the hotel was perfect it is smack right at the heart of Singapore. It was convenient to roam around attractions. The hotel is just beside Garden by the Bay and the room that I had was overlooking the Garden which was beautiful. The infinity pool was great and one of a kind. The service from the staff were generally excellent and efficient. Otherwise, I felt that price was a little overprice as I felt the room was big but it didn't have the wow factor. There wasn't any convenient store within the hotel area. It would have been great if the parking is free for hotel guests. Overall, nice place to stay in if it's your first time in Singapore and for the locals to have a…",4,
"This is an Icon hotel for Asia. It is a very big establishment, but they do a very good job of accommodating so many guests. Just keep in mind that it is not an intimate experience with the level of visitors.   I would highly recommend you coordinate you trip with one of the many shows that grace Marina Bay Sands. They have a lot of top tier performances, the greatest of which I experienced was the Rolling Stones a few years back. They have a lot of shows and cater to a wide variety of customers so check for shows and book to ensure you get the full Marina Bay Sands experience.   My king size bed room was nicely furnished and well maintained. Nothing extravagant, and clearly designed to cater to the Sand’s very diverse clientele from across Asia.

"We stayed there for 2 nights and overall it was just okay. On the first impression, we felt the hotel room was impressive but after awhile it was quite overwhelming for us. For the price paid, the hotel room usage was too rigid - mini fridge was fully loaded but we were told once we pick up an item (eg a drink), we will be automatically billed. Hotel card keys were limited to only 2 despite us requesting for an additional card. Wifi was not as efficient as we thought it will be - it keeps signing us out and the trouble to keep prompting to key in the password.   Amenities was okay but for a 5 star hotel, there is no water spray for toilet usage which we felt a little uncomfortable with. Infinity pool was amazing with the spectacular view and the hoteliers always have a smile on.…",4,
"Booked 2 deluxe rooms for a night over a weekend. One for myself n my 2 kids while the other one is for my parents. Wanted to bring my parents here for a visit especially to the famous Skypark since they haven't got a chance to go up there to admire the view.   The day before arriving, the MBS recep actually SMS me to request my confirmation of the bed configurations for the 2 rooms. On the day itself, i actually received a SMS around 12plus noon that my rooms are ready and i can come down to do a quick check in anytime. WOW! Pretty efficient! I was impressed that the hotel really made full use of current technology!   Upon arrival around 2plus in afternoon, I was in for a big pleasant surprise! The friendly recep, Kristel Jade told that my 2 rooms have been given a…",5,
"This was a treat to round off our 18 day Asian holiday. It is a Mega hotel and that takes a bit of adjusting to. We checked in about 6pm with no problems, we were 'upgraded' to city view room on 29th floor which was very large and great view of River and Merlion.Infinity pool is spectacular but very busy at the weekend however most people stand on the edge and take selfies so if you want to actually swim its quite easy. Wi-fi was good and service was very good throughout our stay. Enjoyed breakfast and evening cocktails in the restaurant on the 57th floor by the pool (no idea what its called, 60 eating places in one hotel is insane and I have no idea what any of them where called). An experience that was mostly great fun. It is very expensive and I'm not sure I would pay twice…",4,
"We just had our wedding anniversary staycation and thought we do another one since it is so close to both our birthdays. Decided on Marina Bay Sands as we always drove past it in the city and never stayed there before.  Went ahead and booked for Club Room due to its privileges and access to club55. Our young boy 3 years old joined us and was excited about the infinity pool which has become an iconic part of MBS.  Reached the hotel about 210pm (their official check-in was 3pm), was told that the room was not ready and the counter staff registered and gave us access to have a look at lvl 57 (infinity pool) or lvl 55 clubb55 (for those that have club lounge access).  We went to the club55 and the view was panoramic. You could catch two amazing views from here, one at the city view…",5,
"It is a beautiful and impressive hotel, with great views, amazing service, good restaurants and an outstanding location in Singapore. My verdict, great for a first time in Singapore, for a short stay; my reasons:  1. It is incredibly crowded, we did not even want to go in the pool with so many people.  2. It is very expensive, but so is Singapore in general, however, we would want to try other luxury hotels (there are several).   Overall, it is amazing, and the location and views are impossible to beat, but know that floor number and price are correlated. ",4,
"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of out trip as it was my Girlfriends birthday. The hotel is impressive however as its so large and very very busy it looses its personal feel, you do feel a little like a number to them. The hotel pool is amazing the spa and facilities are fantastic. The room had incredible views of the garden by the bay which was magical when the light show starts. The only downside was the bars/clubs at the top, to enter there was still a large service charge which I thought considering how much I as paying a night entry should be included. Also myself and Girlfriend was unwell on day two, we think it was something we ate at the hotel but cannot 100% confirm, just be careful as we think it may have been linked to the one room service meal we ate as we…",4,
"The hotel has lots of great amenities such as a variety of restaurants, bars, Banyan Tree Spa, fitness centre, casino, amazing infinity pool and is located next a mall and the gardens.  The service is good; however due to the size of the hotel there is no personal touch.",4,
"This is the first negative review that I have posted which is disappointing for such a superior class hotel. We stayed in Tower 3 for 2 nights after taking over 30 mins to check in - the hotel did not have our reservations correct as per our confirmation.  Whilst the receptionist tried to help us, there was a distinct lack of ability to make decisions without escalating.  I felt as though I was staying in an office block rather than a hotel.  The pool location and facilities were magnificent but let down by debris (skin? dirt?) in the water and an over zealous rule that every person entering needed their own hotel key - we took one key per couple and subsequently had to return to our rooms, some way away to retrieve the other keys and gain entry.  Surely the hotel bathrobe was a…",3,
"The hotel is so expensive that it is out of reach even for most locals, hence if you do have the chance to come here, make sure you book through a third party site like booking.com to have a smoother transaction. SERIOUSLY.   I'm a local, and decided to book directly with MBS. Oh gosh. Big mistake. For every little thing I had to email them, which takes awhile for a reply (rather understandable, but still not wanted by me).  When we finally went to the hotel and asked about parking (we are locals, so we drove there), the check in counter directed us to the valet... SERIOUSLY PLEASE? Why!????! After doing thousands of check in a day you don't know about parking???????????  And they told us there's no breakfast. What???!?!!!!!!!  Why??!!!!??!!  They said that my booking didn't…",4,
"The overall stay was perfect and great. The room was big and spacious with a great view of the Garden By The Bay. Which you could watch the special performance daily at 7.45pm and 8.45pm daily from the private balcony. My room was 1383 and the view is still dazzling with the sea view...  The toilet was huge with a bath tube big enough for someone to sleep in it. The tea provided are from TWG and the coffee are from Robert Timms. The bed was very comfortable however the bed portion that is nearer to the window is slightly sink it. Other than that everything was perfect, as we request for a additional bathrobe it was delivery within mins and also the request for a quick room make up was also done in a quickest time.  The infinity pool was amazing too with the view that facing the…",5,
"Decided to stay here as the reviews were really good to fantastic. Go the extra mile and books club room, it offers great value for money overall. It may seem like an expensive option but it's really worth it.  The views from the room over the bay are amazing. Faster check in and out, not that it was really needed as there were never long quests but it helped to be able to literally walk straight up to the desk. The club lounge on the 55th floor offers views of both the the bay and of the ships out on the sea. It's small enough to be exclusive although at peak times there was often a wait to be seated but you were offered champaign or other equivalent while you waited.  The staff in the club lounge were amazing and certainly the biggest asset to the hotel  the hotel is clean to…",5,
"The rooms, the cleanness, the pool, the mall, the staff, the vibe, the views....You just don't want to leave but it is so expensive that unfortunately most people choose it only for a one night experience. But it is so worth it! Bare in mind that at check in it is very crowded and if you want to get in your room and pool as soon as possible, do come early! Staff is very friendly and helpful.  All rooms with garden view have balconies but bare in mind that only the first 5 floors or something have a sitting balcony, the others have just a small place to exit and enjoy the view. Wifi in rooms is exceptional and free! The pool is just breathtaking and the menu is surprisingly affordable! Nothing compares with eating a club sandwich at the infinity pool! :) When we visited it was my…",5,
"Very big hotel with quality rooms. The infinity pool on the deck is impressive as well as the hordes of people doing selfies... Rooms are clean and well equipped, due to the high numer of rooms you feel a little lost ( I personally prefere smaller hotels) The hotel is connected to a huge shopping mall with all the expensive stuff you might need (or not) and a nice food court. The metro is right on the spot ( Circle line) Great place for a congress and city trip. Not in walking disctance to Orchard road but as it is terribly hot and humid you'd prefer to use MRT or taxi anyway...",4,
"I am a frequent business and I have visited Singapore many times over the years. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The customer service is nonexistent, the infrastructure poor, the food bad and the hotel strives to overcharge you for every possible extra. There are many fine hotels in Singapore - go to one of them instead.",1,
the hotel has a marvellous structure with three pillars . It has a very nice and unique swimming pool at the top floor. it seems that it has no edge on the other side. worth staying. having lots of shops and an artificial canal where you can enjoy boating. has a big casino,5,
"Had a great opportunity to visit the hotel for 2 nights and must admit, the hotel by itself was the biggest highlight of or trip to Singapore. If you do not have time for sightseeing and are willing to relax and enjoy the best views , this hotel is perfect for you ! The rooms are spacious and up-to the standards, we had a view to the gardens by the bay and the ocean, it was fantastic ! The only disappointing part of our stay was the fact that after checking out, we could not use any more the pool on the roof, and we still had plenty of time prior to our flight . Nevertheless , if this is your first visit of Singapore, please make sure you book Marina Bay Sands for your stay, you will not regret it.",4,
"The service at the Marina Bay Sands is appalling. While it likes to think it is a high class hotel, it is not. It is Vegas and Disney, without the service. We arrived late and at check in they claimed not to have the rooms we had booked - we booked two rooms, one king size. We were treated as if we had just showed up without a reservation. We were given million excuses - they did not have rooms next to each other, then we have no king size room we are very busy (in the meantime a couple who came after us got a King size room no problem). Miraculously, after we kept insisting an told them we would make sure to share what terrible customer service they had, a king size room appeared. Yes, the roof top pool is amazing, but just go see it and stay at the Fullerton",2,
"A modern hotel, with too many rooms, automatic mini bar, shopping mall with approx. 400 outlets and 60 restaurants. It looks like Las Vegas. It was actually a bit too much for uw. If you want to visit Singapore, we suggest Santosa Island.",4,
"Since its inception (of course with those countless ads that often feature the hotel & infinity pool), I have always wanted to experience all the hypes and features on my own. Thanks to the hotel management, we were able to know how and where we could park our car, as we drove all the way from Malaysia. The only confusion was trying to find out how we could enjoy the hotel rate for overnight parking. Upon checking in, we were surprised by a complimentary cake by the hotel. We were celebrating our anniversary that day and this gesture was very thoughtful and sweet. Having the room facing the seafront & Garden by the Bay was excellent and breathtaking.  Like many first timers, we were excited to enjoy the infinity pool, only to find out that the entire area were crowded with other…",4,
"We decided to go to the bar for a drink. I mean how much can 2 beers cost.? Stand at the edge and look out over the city,and the bay. Forty two dollars, is how much , for a corona and a stella!  They serve food as well.  You can elect to pay and go to the floor below which looked pretty unshaded. .since we did this last time in Singapore  you will not get close to the pool area.  And i think the beer prices must have gone up ,And yes i kept a straight face tipped and said ""keep the change"" Seriously though ,the view is great and you should see the expanse of city growth. We did not try the giant singapre flyer.,but i imagine the view from that would be good too",4,
"Want a nice relaxing drink with a view to kill for while in Singapore, then go to tower 3 at the Marina Bay Sands and look for the elevator to the bar on Level 57.  No entry fee to get access to the bar (as opposed to the $23SG for access to the observation deck 1 floor down), so spend the money on a decent glass of bubbly or a nice cocktail and enjoy the view over Singapore",4,
"Highly luxurious Hotel with good connectivity to rest of Singapore from SMRT which is well maintained train connection across Singapore. They have inbuilt mall which is huge. They also have casino which is very well maintained and entry is free of cost if you are staying there. And don't miss infinity pool, which is one of its kind on top floor of  marina bay sands. Awsum view of Singapore sky rises. It also have connectivity to botanic gardens and for many rooms its facing towards botanic garden.",4,
"main reason to stay here is the infinity pool and if your in a club room the breakfast room is next to that otherwise its on the ground floor and open designed. great staff, rooms fine. get up to the pool , sit and enjoy a cocktail whilst looking down on Singapore's civic district and business districts.",4,
It was a nice experience staying at MBS. - Fantastic Sky Pool at Level57 - Attentive Service - Good Breakfast (varieties of choices) - Nice ambiance of the hotel room - Strategic location whereby nearby to MRT & bus station,5,
"Everything about this hotel is magnificent, the luxurious rooms, the breakfast and of course the unbelievable roof top pool. I would enjoy starting my day with an early morning swim and finish day with an evening drink at the various bars by the pool. The view is spectacluar day and night. The close proximity to the Marina Bay Shoppes was an advantage, a wonderful way to spend the day and an easy walk to the Gardens by the Bay.",5,
"I have traveled to Singapore many times with stays at various hotels, because of my conference was conducted over there so it is convenience for me to stay at the same location.   Later on i have to add Marina Bay Sands to be one of my favorites. From the infinity pool the top the hotel overseeing the city, to the easy connection to the many shops and restaurants at the mall next door, this hotel has to be the jewel of Singapore. This is quite the place!",4,
"We stayed here for a couple of nights over my birthday whilst visiting family in Singapore. The hotel is very good - aside from the obvious very individual appearance of the hotel from the outside, the pool on the roof is fantastic and provides an opportunity to take some great photos on a clear day. Staff are incredibly friendly and service is great. The rooms are furnished to a very high standard, although I have to say (aside from the awesome view) they are pretty standard, 'Hilton style' in appearance. The shops and bars underneath the hotel are very exclusive and certainly worth a visit, and the hotel provides very easy access to marina bay itself which is beautiful. ",4,
