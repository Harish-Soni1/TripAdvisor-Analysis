"Too often, iconic signature hotels prove to be a disappointment - this definitely wasn't the case at MBS. The hotel is stunning and the service was impeccable. We'd booked to have an Orchid suite so had the advantage of quick check in and access to the Club Lounge. On arrival we found we'd been upgraded to a Sands suite which was fantastic. Superb views of Gardens on The Bay and we even had a pool table in our suite. The pool was as spectacular as it looks in photos - and when we visited just before Christmas, it wasn't too busy. We easily got pool side loungers. The service in the club lounge was some of the best we've ever experienced. All in all we couldn't fault MBS and hope to return.",5
"Great hotel to stay in if you are coming to Singapore for a holidays or even a short staycation for Singaporean. The service from the receptionist, porters, security personnel, cleaners basically every staffs who saw you, they will greet you with a smile. It is not easy to make every single staff in the hotel to do this.   The only challenge is that when you want to go for supper, the surrounding area had nothing much to eat as you need to travel quite a distance out and the hotel room price is abit high for some commoners to try it. To me why you paying this rate is because of the fantastic location and greats views you can see in the day and night, by over looking the Garden by the bay, Singapore river, esplanade,boat quay,clarke q etc..",4
Incredible place. Let us check in early and we had an amazing room on the 44th floor. Swimming pool was incredible and whilst busy (and the hotel was full) we always found a sunbed and managed to get drinks relatively easily. Breakfast was noisy but very slick service and lovely food. The sky bar on the 57th floor is great as is Adrift restaurant. The gym is well equipped with two Olympic bars and treadmills facing the city on the 55th floor!   Only bad thing was that we had to leave! ,5
"Being a Singaporean based abroad, it is rare that I ever stay in hotels when I return home.   We were treated to a night at MBS as a gift and we were upgraded to a city view room overlooking the marina bay financial district, the Fullerton hotel, the esplanade and the rest of Singapore's skyline.  The view was incredible.... The infinity pool provided an incredible experience that lived up to the photos I had seen and the stories I have heard from other people's experiences.   Will be back if we can. Won't be anytime soon. But would be an awesome experience for anyone.",5
"Transit in Singapore for 1 night at the orchid suite :  Pros ：  1. Lobby looks great 2. Concierge services is good 3. Bellboy is good 4. Rise restaurant at lobby is good (plenty of choices) 5. Amazing scene at Sky 57 5. Bath pressure is good 6. Windows curtain is good 7. Sleep quality is good 8. Pool table in the room is good 9. Shopping centre next door 10. Attraction next door  Cons:   1. Living area in suite room is too simple as like a 3 - 4 star apartment.  2. Sky 57 is the worst breakfast experience      a. Lack of choices for breakfast (like apartment breakfast)     b. All the tea spoon hidden      c. The ladies serving like day dream, they not even can find a place, and finally we    need to show them the empty seat.     d. The only guy at the open area should have more…",1
"Excellent check-in. Décor is starting to age a bit, but still maintained well and the huge Christmas tree was very nice to see in Asia during the festive season. Rooms excellent as usual. Deck on the top floor very crowded, but well maintained. View still phenomenal. Restaurants were very good. Bar crowded but good. Overall still an excellent choice, even if competition is offering other excellent places to stay as well.",5
"Great hotel, excellent location! We stayed here for 2 nights and had a wonderful time if you don't want to explore the city or have been to Singapore before the restaurant choices at the hotel should cover everyone's tastes as well as the different bar scenes. The pool is amazing and one to tick off the bucket list, the shopping is close by and the food court in the mall had some nice choices. If you haven't seen the gardens by the sea it is well worth the stroll across the road.",5
"We went to the roof-top pub in Marina Bay sands. The view from here was magical. There were interesting options for cocktails and super friendly staff. We did not have access to the pool, since that is open for people who are residing in the hotel itself.",4
"Never stay at the hotel buy always one of my destination to visit whenever i am in sg beside ion orchard. Good priveleges for foreigners as well as loads of awesome exhibitions. Beside exhibitions, there is a casino as well as a theater so loads of stuffs to do here. U gotta make the mbs membership, it allows u to get discounts as well as collect points/dollars that can be used for loads of things, one of them is free parking/valet!! The current promo that they are having is 100 dollar vouchers for every 1000 dollar purchase (limited to 60 a day) till the end of 31 dec 2015...so i guess...my fellow shoppers....shopping spree time!!",5
"This place is a joke. I'd booked it for my husband's birthday as he wanted a nice family photo in the infinity pool. We lined up to check in for about 30 minutes! Then we lined up to get a seat by the pool. Then we lined up for the tiny jacuzzi with about 50 people jammed into it. You line up for the elevators, for breakfast, to check-in, to check-out, and pretty much everything else. We felt cattle being shunted around in here.There are crowds literally EVERYWHERE!  The Infinity Pool has a pretty lame and sparse menu so you'd better enjoy Club Sandwiches. For what you pay here, you'd receive amazing service at pretty much any other hotel. The upside was the room - we were on the 45th floor and the view was amazing. Done it once, won't be coming back here again...",3
"The hotel is excellent, service is excellent, the buffet lunch in the ground floor restaurant is very good value for a hotel meal. Free access to rooftop garden and pool, saves you a visit to the eye Ferris wheel. Views from either side of hotel magnificent.but garden side lets you view nitetimeshows of floowwoer garden from comfort.Access to shopping mall and railway under cover. You could spend almost your entire holiday in airconditioned comfort if you stay at marina bay sands. Loved it so much, have stayed twice and my wife hs been 3 times",5
"The hotel is not cheap.  However, the general feeling was the hotel operated like a mass production service.  Check in took a long time (30-40 mins), the main attraction (infinity pool) was overloaded with people and I mean over loaded (I live in Hong Kong). In reflection, I think the whole purpose of the hotel itself was for people to stay there and get a selfie in the pool, and sure there were magnificent city views. Also the lifts were constantly full.  We stayed on the 33-34th floors in Towers 3 and also rooms in Tower 2.  It could take up to 15 minutes to get down during check in and check out times, breakfast etc... Not the relaxing city getaway we were hoping for, instead we got a battle and much too busy experience for a price that we would never pay for again.",2
The best experience out of all my precious Hotel experiences. Expensive but a great value for money Infinity pool is a Must and a lifetime experience .. Take-care you cant access the pool unless you are a n Hotel Guest.  .  Casino was so Nice  Mall and restaurants were elegant and really nice covering all the varieties,5
"Awesome!   It offers great view of the city, top of the line amenities and quality service!   Simply the best in Singapore!   I love the spacious rooms and comfortable beds.  I stayed here with my Manulife PH team and we received a warm welcome. Nice treat to the Manulife family.   The Filipino staff are usually warm and welcoming.   If you have extra money, you may want to stay here. But not recommended if you are on a budget.   Just enjoy the night life in the area and watch the water and light show every night!",5
"If MBS is a multi star hotel, I doubt it worth it, even I am a Singaporean. I will find Pan Pacific or Oriental or even Westin Stamford be a better choice.  It's a pricy trap or I should say a pricy stay for tourists. Shopping alone is a bomb, dining is a killer. Prices are at least double or triple from the outside given the same plate of food that you may find outside.  My worst impression was checking out the valet cashier. In house hotel guest supposed to enjoy flat rate 12$. Check out timing was at 12 and the valet counter was freaking packed, long queue. Was charged extra for the late car checkout. The cashier replied me that I was late, and I pointed out please see your queue. I'd checked out already. Cashier said, sir your waiting time in the queue wasn't that long…",1
"Excellent view of The Gardens by the Bay from Bay side room, if you are looking relaxing time, must drinks Margarita in the pool, Sky park (Infinity Pool). Room service was exceller to. Near Mall and Museum. !!",5
"Splendid infrastructure and amenities.  Did not managed to head to the roof due to bad weather.  Very posh and established.  Wandered to the casino just to have a look see but was confused and amazed at the layers of security.  Had to check in a knapsack but was told I had to finish the water in my water bottle. Had to check passports close to 6 times including checking in my bag and on the way out.  Other than that, nice establishment",3
"Service from the staff has to be commended. The guys at the concierge were quick and efficient. The front desk staff were courteous. The waiters and waitresses at Sky on 57 were also very polite and courteous. The only comment i have for Sky on 57 was the loud instructions by the chef that can be heard in the dining area overlooking the city. The room we had was great, overlooking the Gardens by the Bay.   Access to the mall is very good. Lots of good places to wine and dine. Overall a good experience for me and the wife.",4
"The room has a good overview of gardens by the bay.. Me and wife totally love it. Wanted to give a surprise to my wife as it was our wedding anniversary, I approached a staff named shiying who helped to surprise my wife with a Swan decoration with rose petals on the bed after we came back for a swim.. appreciate what she have done for us. Will definitely come back for stay vacation in the future!!",5
"Central. Near Gardens by the Bay and Bayfront mrt station. Room service was excellent. I called at least 3 times, every time it arrived within 15mins.  Big, spacious and very clean room. With great views. Will go back for another staycation.",4
"Stayed in the family suite which was amazing. The room is spacious with a king sized bed, two single beds, sofa settees, balcony, ... and a beautiful view of the Super Trees at the Gardens by the Bay. The swimming pool at the top of the building is breath-taking. Only downside was that the water in the pool is icy cold. Got to be really brave to take the first plunge and after the body adjusted to the temperature, it would be ok.",5
Will give this hotel a top rating if not for the LONG queue to check in and check out and incident at the rooftop pool where we cant find any towel when they suddenly closed the pool due to the storm. The staff told me and my family while we are still wet to go down to our own room to get the towel and dry up there as they cant give us the towel due to the towel booth is closed. I cant believed the staff dont have any spare towel in the storage room or staff room.,4
"i have to wait for more than 2 hours for the room to be ready, the hotel last July was jumpacked! room has nothing special but its really clean! my room has a balcony facing the garden which made me satisfy. the pool was not as i expect it to be. i couldnt deny the fact that the hotel facade/ structure is very mindblowing.  note: it is a busy and crowded hotel so i would not recommend it to someone who's looking for a relax and quiet environment. ",4
"Be it the Gardens by the Bay view or the City view, even the most basic room is worth it. Spacious and has all the necessary frills to get your going.   The service is commendable. Quick, prompt and courteous.   Love the TWG tea selection.   Only issue I had was with the wifi, whereby you have to log in every time you enter the room, which is a hassle. The pillows could also be firmer.",4
"awesome location if you have a room facing the lake! you can see the mer lion, and the laser light show from the french windows that run from wall to wall in the upper storey suites. you can request for a higher storey when you book or when you check in. i felt it was a waste of time to sleep while staying there.  but on the flip side, it is one of the most expensive hotels in singapore",5
"We stayed in the club rooms which included a spacious room on the 20th floor with exceptional views of the the City as well as the sea, access to the breakfast, tea and afternoon drinks at the club house located on the 55th floor, and to the infinity pool on the 57th floor.   If you are a foodie you will enjoy this package as they change the menu for tea every single day. There are a variety of choices for all meals and the chefs are very creative. Drinks were included which meant a variety of alcoholic beverages including champagne.   The Room was comfortable although the bed was a bit too stiff for me. Complementary tea and coffee was available but all items in the fridge were priced. Be wary of taking any drinks from the fridge as they use a sensor to detect if any drinks…",4
"Positive Feedback: - best infinity pool  - friendly staffs, great customer service - clean room, comfy bed and pillows, spacious room - modern hotel design   Negative Feedback: - expensive but worth it lol",5
"We were encouraged to visit Marina Bay Sands by other visitors to Singapore but our experience was disappointing.  The complex is amazing from a distance and promised much.  Unfortunately on our arrival the Sky Bar was closed due to poor weather, but we were invited instead to the Club lounge, also on the 57th floor.  The views were expansive, but not that different from other viewpoints we had visited in Singapore.  The Club Lounge was open- but most of it was enclosed in scaffolding due to renovations taking place.  We were ushered to a narrow balcony, with a small table and no stools.  Having come this far we decided to order a drink- a beer and a Sangria came to $48!  A bit pricy at a stand up bar!  Anyway been there, done that- can only imagine what it costs to eat there!",3
"If you can, get a room that allows you access to the club.We had a city view on the 49 floor it was spectacular. This hotel is exceptional and very unique.All the staff are amazing and made our time here very special",5
"Honestly, I was expecting much more in terms of bedrooms. The building is something that deserves a visit as well as the pool, but to stay there is quite expensive for the experience since the rooms are not better than other offers in the town. So, if you can visit the pool try this alternative instead paying high amounts of money to sleep there!",4
"Love the infinity pool but was very busy, really wasn't meant for swimming, more just for photos and a good view! The sky bar is super expensive as are the shops and food below. I was upgraded to a suite which was stunning and really enjoyed my stay here.",4
"This was our 2nd stay here and we were just as impressed by the design, architecture, facilities and excellent service provided. Yes it is expensive but at least you feel that you got what you paid for and afterall luxury by it's very defination is expensive. The higher floors have less street noise and better views. The views from either side of the towers are amazing. Visit the infinity pool at night to enjoy the lights of the city. Treat yourself to at least a couple nights here. You know you are worth it.",5
"The best hotel I stayed in ever. Simply, you can enjoy every moment and every place in this hotel. The restaurants, the pool, and shopping mall and even the loopy are above my expectation. The room, reception, and staff were unbelievable, you are in the right place.  ",5
"Overall, our stay was okay. It was easy to check-in since most of the people responsible for it are Filipinos. One thing though, we paid so much money for the hotel but the room we got was kinda disappointing. It was small for the price. You would get a much more spacious room with breakfast buffets for much much less. Well, I can't blame them. We pay for the name of the hotel.  I enjoyed greatly the infinity pool. IT WAS AWESOME! Especially during sunrise and sunset. Although I had fun with the infinity pool, this is a one time deal for me. I would allot my money to something different rather than staying there again. If I become rich that's when I'd probably come back. Haha",4
"The hotel is enormous, lush plants, rivers, cascades, bridges, various restaurants for all tastes, Casino, Museum and the most luxurious designer shops are ready to part you from you money and entertain you.  The rooms are excellent, with superb views and the staff are discreet, very polite and pleasant. The Infinity pool at the level 57 is a magical experience, view, palm trees and all, but the restaurant next door, is not really suited for the ones without a head for heights.  The price for your stay there is appropriate for the quality of this unforgettable place, which I strongly recommended.  I actually returned there soon after, just to enliven the experience.",5
Amazing as always. I think I have not written a review about it yet. So here goes...  I really hate the crowds here but their product is amazing. The view especially with the garden by the bay christmas special!  Staff are clearly overworked with the enormous crowds coming in but I think they are doing a great job!,5
"If you spend any time in Singapore, spend at least one night at the Marina Bay Sands.  We had booked the Premier room with 2 x double bed of our family of room.  The room size is quite decent.  The hotel itself is massive and quite a bit of walking to do within the hotel itself :-) The Infinity Pool on the rooftop is marvelous.  Hang over the edge and view the skyline which is breathtaking.   The hotel is pricey but for our family of 4 it was worth it and part of our Singapore experience.",5
If you go to Singapore you have to stay here at least one night.  Incredible hotel.  Nice rooms.  Good food. Great location - park nearby for running and mall across the street has food court with decent local food.  But it is the swimming pool that makes this truly unique.  Nothing like it anywhere else.,5
"First of all, the location is Great for going out and shopping. One thing that I appreciate is when the hotel management and talent recognise you are return guests, a small thing maybe but it shows that they appreciate your patronage enough to remember you have been before. This was my second stay. The check in was quick and easy, rooms ready upon arrival. The pool was my next stop where i spent hours each day! What a gorgeous pool!",4
"Standard rooms are decently spacious, not the very best, the upgraded rooms we got were very spacious. Hotels is very clean, staff are friendly and professional, gym is nice big size and spa is great. Infinitely pool is amazingly beautiful. Breakfast selection is really really wide, with decent number catering to vegetarians. Very costly thou I must say, everything from the rooms to additional child for breakfast to the spa etc",5
"If you have the opportunity to spend a few days at this hotel. It is amazing. I was there for a convention. So sorry for the ones who could not book this place. Great rooms, amazing services. The pool on the top of the world looking over downtown Singapore. OK, pricey say the least but we'll worth it. The gala facilities, awesome! Certainly the place to stay in Singapore. ",5
"The price really reflects the luxury! Escalators will take you right into a designer shopping centre. The infinity pool is magical at night! The rooms are so spacious... I'm sure I could have held a small party in the bathroom! The bell boys are really friendly and helpful and were so grateful for a tip. The hotel holds a light show every night and it's well worth watching. People were in awe of it. If you're looking for cheap eats and a more authentic vibe, then I highly recommend going to the Makansutra!! (Approx. 20 mins walking distance from hotel) Our taxi driver absolutely insisted on taking us here as opposed to going to China Town. ",5
"The Orchid suite is enormous and very comfortable. THE swimming pool certainly has the wow factor and is enjoyable when not very busy, especially thanks to the provision of a separate area for families with children. The marina/city views from the 24th floor are spectacular and truly unique. The club facilities on the topmost floor provide the few privileged executive guests with an oasis of quiet and calm and spare them the breakfast queues.  The restaurants are expensive and one can, in all honesty, eat better at the hawker stalls either on the food floor of the attached shopping mall, or, even better, at the open air ones at the other end of the bay by the National Opera. The hotel is an architectural conundrum. It is certainly impressive, vast, and has many other unique…",4
This is such an incredible Place to be. We were lucky and got an upgrate for a Suite in the 54th floor for free. the poolarea is amazing. If you go to singapore you NEED to stay there. This is an absolutly must do!,5
"This hotel is busy and crowded, but the rooms are beautiful and the higher you go up the towers the less you hear. Our room was large and spacious with a great/relaxing bathroom. The bed was big and comfortable. Wifi is not included in the room and costs 20SD for 24 hours. You can get this refunded if you join the rewards scheme, but the desk isn't always open. The hotel is ideally located for the mall and casino but there isn't direct access to the Gardens By the Bay. The pool is stunning but crowded so it is lovely to go and see but isn't somewhere to spend the afternoon relaxing. All in all it is worth visiting but I wouldn't go back.",4
This is one of the more populare stays in Singapore. Their pool is world famous and over look the whole city. There are many pros and cons when you visit the most popular hotel in town. If you hit a day when it is not over crouded you are in luck 💞,4
"We enjoyed staying at Marina Bay sands Hotel. Rooms are very clean. Room service twice a day and very good. Free wifi everywhere and you will have access to the sky park and the rooftop pool which is hell of an experience. The only negative point was that they didn't let us in the Casino, because they check your passport and certain countries passport holders are not permitted, which  was very very disappointing and to me a racist manner.  ",5
"Visit MBS every year but my family still get excited whenever we plan our stay for the weekend.Sill prefer the room facing the sea with stunning view especially the night with fire work & magnificent skyline.The rooftop infinity is amazing,we just love it.Room service is abit expensive & we decide to rent a refrigerator & buy our beer & wine,food from cold storage which is located in the mall & chill our night in the room.Looking forward for our stay next year......",4
"A staycation at MBS as a bday surprise for hubby. The rooms are very spacious. We were very excited about the infinity pool but it feels like you are at a tourist  spot super crowded with people!! They should have a swimming pool for people who actually want to enjoy a nice swim. For budget travellers, need to book much much in advance to get a value for your money.",4
"I stayed at this hotel as I was attending a conference in Singapore . The hotel is amazing and has spectacular views from the amazing infinity pool, the room I had was a suite and very spacious and the staff are very attentive even though it is a huge hotel . Breakfast in the morning is very busy and you will have to cue to get into the restaurant which is a little annoying , but I would recommend a stay there as this was the only fault.",5
"I left this hotel speechless. Staying in a City View room I could not have asked for anything more perfect. The View was amazing, the room was spotless and the staff were extremely friendly. This hotel truly made our Singapore adventure amazing. The pool is of course the highlight of the resort and we did spend most of the time gazing over the city from there. Thank you Mylene for your excellent hospitality.",5
"We just had one night here as a stopover point en route to New Zealand. Chose the hotel purely on the brochure pictures of the infinity pool on the hotel roof. Our flight got into Singapore at 10.30am and we therefore arrived at the hotel around 11.30am - well before the normal check-in time of 3.00pm. We chose to pay an upgrade cost to have a city view club room (which we could have immediately) and this was well worth it. The benefits associated with the club room (which was huge) included afternoon tea,breakfast and evening drinks and canapes all taken at The Club on Floor 55. The service throughout the hotel was very good but we thought that the staff who served us at The Club were exceptional. The pool lived up to expectations and was fairly quiet during the day but a…",5
"I had been waiting to stay in this expensive hotel and finally gotten my chance. The building structure with a ship on top of their three towers is of course the most attractive thing that would caught anybody's attention. The Infinity Pool was beautiful yet short, however it's not so bad, afterall it's for staycation, not expecting a large pool for Olympics.. Lol. However they have limited number of access to the pool per room then.  Reaching to Marina Bay Sands is convenient by train at Bayfront MRT Station. The shopping mall known as The Shoppes is also easily access through the connection and if you have loves for Brands then The Shoppes is definitely for you. There is the Gardens by The Bay which is also accessible from the hotel through a bridge. Beautiful place to go…",3
"While we didn't get the full experience because of the forest fire (the sky was full of smoke), we had a great time at the Marina Bay. The pool and the bars on the roof are a must do. The overall complex is very luxurious. The restaurants are all good and the staff very friendly.",5
"Visited MBS again this year . As usual everything seemed perfect from Valet Parking / Checkin to Dining and room service. The only blooper was a torn towel (it had a big big hole , not to be missed ) , I didn't complain though. But I was definitely shocked to see it. Apart from that breakfast buffet always remains my favorite . I only wish that they had same spread at 57th as at rise. Further I think they need to be a bit particular about not allowing guests to jump into infinity pool , with T-Shirts and Shorts on. A proper swimming attire should be a must. All in All enjoyed  great hospitality and a pleasurable stay.",4
"Such an awesome hotel,amazing views from the stunning infinity pool on the 57th floor.  It may be expensive but it's worth every penny.  the staff are amazing and can't do enough for you,the poolside staff remember your name and ask about your trip even if they haven't seen you for a couple of days. Such a relaxed atmosphere,can't fault it and I can't wait to go back. The must place to stay ",5
"This had to be one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in yet. My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights there for our anniversary and it was one of the best trips we have done. I will say this place is not for those looking for a budget vacation by any means. I also strongly recommend getting a club room with a city view as it really makes it worth while.  The infinity pool on the roof is everything it is hyped up to be with an amazing view of the city and just an experience like no other it is definitely worth staying in this hotel just for that alone. There are tons of restaurants throughout the hotel that are also fantastic. Along with Spago by Wolfgang Puck, which has amazing food is on the rooftop as well. I'd strongly recommend their Angus Beef hamburger.  As we stayed in a club…",5
"Even though you cannot access the infinity pool, Marina bay sky deck is a perfect place to view the skyline of Singapore. Visit there during the evening hours between 5:30-7:00 pm as one can enjoy the beautiful sunset and amazing views of the Singapore skyline.   Visit to this deck would cost you $23(Singaporean) but its worth it. You can also sit on the sky bar and order drinks, bit pricey but good for an experience. If you decide to go to the bar please make sure you don't wear shorts or slippers, proper attire is required!",5
This is my second time in this hotel and it was even better than the first. On my first visit didn't really have the time to enjoy my stay. But this time I did. The room was as amazing as before a bit smaller but still quite bad g. With this time the bed facing the amazing view of the bay ( witch is a better set up than previously. The bathroom was extremely clean and amazing the bed so comfortable. The pool and the staff there always as amazing. The room service and breakfast m the room was amazing ( but they should add an additional chair to the room ). Just a wonderful stay in that amazing hotel.,5
"I spent two nights at the Marina Bay Sands in a city view room.  I am definitely glad I paid extra for the city view -- it was awesome!   I can't imagine staying for any period of time more than 2-3 nights given the price/cost/benefit.  While the staff were exceptionally attentive, there were still delays in reception, checkin/checkout (there is probably an online/sms/etc way to do it), baggage check, simply due to sheer volume.  The hotel feels a bit like a factory as there are loads of people around.  The pool is beautiful, and there is plenty to do in the area (for example, see the gardens), and the hotel is also connected to an MRT station.  I had a great time at the hotel.",4
"One of the best hotels concerning location, facilities (shops, bars, restaurants, gym, casino), rooms and ofcourse the swimming pool and skydeck. That infinity pool is one of the largest and best pools I have ever seen. Really amazing!",5
"This week I visited MBS with my family and thoroughly enjoyed two nights / three days stay. The hotel had so much to offer us – great view (both city side and garden side), location with easy accessibility (taxi, MRT, buses), adjoining to tourists places, shopping malls & food joints, plenty amenities (both within the hotel and in-room), humble and helping staff; last but not the least – the infinity pool which makes you swim at top of the world!",5
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands was one of our holiday highlights, in particular having breakfast on the roof - the western/eastern buffet includes an a la carte menu choice. I chose the 2 hour slow cooked eggs and was initially regretting my choice when they appeared so watery and with the tiniest portion of ham but to my great surprise it was sensational, a real foodie delight.   Best views in Singapore - we watched the evening hi tech light show from our room. However, it would be even better from the roof with a cocktail and fresh oysters. The night time views are absolutely stunning.  Large luxurious room (no bathtub). Excellent service. We only had 1 night but loved it and would definitely stay again for longer (2-3 nights) and try more of what is on offer.",5
"i love the pool most in that hotel, the view is amazing, rooms are comfortable and the service is brilliant.  Singapore not my favorite city but the hotel is worth to come back again. the breakfast offer is big but to expesive if u need a small breakfast. in the area u wont find anything for lower budget. otherwise a top hotel",5
If you want to experience a unique pool on top of the building & have 360 view of Singapore you should stay here for 1 night but I won't recommend for more.  Because with very high price but not included breakfast is a huge mistake for a high quality hotel. The quality of the room is just ok compare with that price.,3
"No question, the views from the rooftop and its pool are stunning. But you have to expect a very industrialized product facing serious quality issues: delays at taxi drop off (one of 5 lanes to give you an idea of the scale), waiting time at check-in and elevators, bathroom smelly, toilet not perfectly clean, little insects in bathtub, slow sink, sand in bed (has to do with the name, I guess), no furniture at all on balcony, access to rooftop secured like London tube (don't you dare to forget the 2nd keycard for the 2nd person). To wrap it up: for one night in life it might make sense due to the rooftop. Not one day longer.",2
"We stayed here on our way back from Australia to London for one night. It is  clearly a high end hotel, and the room was amazing. We had a late check out so spent most of our day by the pool- an amazing view over the City. I did at time feel the pool staff were a little pushy about buying drinks. We had lunch at the pool restaurant instead of by the pool, and the food and staff were very nice. The hotel is huge, and it is impressive how it is run... But I am not sure I could spend more then a few nights here. It felt constantly busy (which you would expect), which was fine for one night but maybe not for a longer stay. ",4
"Standard Hotel Rooms are similar to other Five star hotels, Just to experience the Infinity pool I chose this property. Pool experience is awesome, You can enjoy the Singapore city from the Pool and have few cocktails on the chair. They have few resturants and clubs on the roof. We got garden bay view, it was breathtaking. like we are looking at a fantasy world. You need to have key card to access the Pool. so each guest should carry the card always. Hotel has a big mall down , you can enjoy the shopping. They have supermarket also down. Chek in time was more than 20 minutes. Bed sheet and pillow covers had bad smell.",4
Top class hotel in prime location. Book a room overlooking the Bay Gardens above the 40th floor in the 'Club' section. This gives access and entry to the infinity pool. which is spectacular. Rooms and suites on this side give unlimited views of the Straits. Room was very comfortable with every facility.,5
"The ease in check-in, check-out,  cleanliness and privacy in this prestigious hotel is admittedly some of its good points. And though it's not our first time in Marina Bay Sands for shopping and dining, the first time we stayed in the MBS hotel somehow left a negative impression to us. Early this year, we decided to stay in Singapore's most luxurious hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday. The suite assigned to us was impressive, tidy, comfortable, with the great view of the Gardens by the Bay, and having complete amenities that you can expect for a S$600-800/night stay. A complimentary cake for the celebrant even made an added positive point to our already good impression with MBS. But the fond memories of having experienced the above plus a good dip and breakfast by the…",3
"MBS is something everyone should experience for a night. But in the end, it is still a hotel. The famous infinity pool is scenic, but after 30 minutes, the initial ""wow"" factor is gone. The rooms are nice and spacious. The amenities are plentiful, but quite expensive (if you take a taxi, you can find better spas for half the price). The service is also good.  The reason for the 3 rating is the price. Everything was a 4: service, rooms, food, etc. But it is one of the more expensive experiences. You should do this once. But if you want true luxury at the same price, you should take a short trip to Thailand or Bali. In the end, you are paying for a unique experience in an iconic building in one of the more expensive cities in the world.  When you do stay, book a package. The food…",3
"The hotel is BIG. I had a nice room, balcony and view. I will say that the breakfast buffet on the main lobby was not that great. Too busy and the  food was not that flavorful. One of the draws is the infinity pool, which is nice. However if you go mid day and onward, it will be packed. Clean rooms and service was good.  Plenty of restaurants, but pricey, but if staying there I doubt that will be a problem.  I liked it, but would stay at a smaller hotel next time around.",4
"I stayed with my 2 kids in one room, room is big and modern but lacks warmth, had to call a few times to get the 3rd bed in the room. Bathroom is big and nice but let down by lack of power from the shower. Sky gardens and pol are very nice as is the food. Check -out was a nightmare, takes too long ....at one stage for 10 minutes just one lady behind the desk.....at 12.30? Not good. Overall experience bit mixed...good and bad things....however for the price you expect more.",3
"Okay so I was extremely lucky and got to stay in the presidential suit. As I'm sure you can imagine it was fantastic. Huge! 3 bedrooms. All with en suit bathrooms with the master bedroom having a 'his' and 'hers' bathroom (yeah there were 2 bathrooms to this one huge bedroom all the bathrooms had jacuzzi style baths and huge showers, my favourite though (which freaked me out at first) was the automatic toilets; the lids lifted and fell on their own on a motion sensor, they flushed on their own and the seats were heated! there were a bunch of other buttons I didnt play with, but when I left and came back to reality the toilet was absolutely the thing I missed a surprisingly big amount (haha). there are 2 living rooms and a giant round dining table a karaoke room study 'gym' - a…",5
Landmark hotel in Singapore at a central location. It has several attraction within and around hotel. However the highlight is Infinity pool on roof top giving a breathtaking view of the city. Near by shopping mall and casino are must to visit,5
Stunning hotel but not like any 5 star I've visited before - due to the high number of guests checking in and out constantly it's very impersonal. The pool is definitely the highlight - would recommend getting up there for sunrise as it's stunning and a very surreal experience. The gym is also great and the staff in there were lovely.   We arrived at 6am and weren't able to check in early however were given access to the pool area and our bags were stored for us. They also held our bags for checkout which was helpful.   Glad we stayed there for the experience but most likely won't be back.,4
We stayed here for four nights on the start of our round the world trip.  We had a club room on the 49th floor facing towards the city. The room wasn't ready when we arrived at 10am but we were given wifi access and cards to go to the pool if we wanted. The view from the room was amazing being so high up and the room itself was massive. Couldn't really fault it. Housekeeping were very good too. The club staff we very friendly at morning for breakfast and at the 5pm-7pm canapés and drinks. Lots on offer and the champagne was free flowing. The staff were very attentive and remembered your name.  This hotel though is all about the pool. It's breathtaking. We went mostly at night and it wasn't that busy but still warm and the most amazing views. Nobody is really swimming - unless…,5
Marina Bay is one of the reasons I want to return to Singapore. It's an impressive display of architecture combined with the given natural beauty.,5
"The hotel is the best thing in Singapore. Not only the hotel but everything around is perfect. The prices follows the luxury and the infrastructure, they are high!! I recommend 2 day in The Marina Bay Hotel, is enough to join the pool and the attractions around!",5
"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a work conference, and it was a great location. Very busy, and a not cheap, but I would definitely stay here again. The highlight is of course the infinity pool on the roof, which just has the most amazing view of Singapore. They pool is very long, and there is an adults only section near the entrance above Tower 3. At first the pool seems very busy, but what you actually find is a lot of people only come in quickly for 15 mins, take some photos and then move on, so it's actually quite easy to find a lounger if you want to lay out and relax. The breakfast buffet is about $40USD, but it is a feast! So much food to choose from, and the shopping centre connected is full to the brim with amazing store.",4
Top floor is amazing as one can see the from the hotel photo and need not have to mention. One pays a high rate for the swimming pool and view. Excellent. Would recommend when one plans to use the hotel and hotel area. If going for the first time to Singapore as a tourist and will be out most of the time than can plan for your next visit unless one is loaded.,4
"I travelled in Asia for 4 months and decided to end my trip here. It was awesome! I checked in early, and took a swim in the infinity pool. I ate a lovely dinner at the restaurant and went to the endless chocolate bar!   The room was breathtaking with a window from top to bottom. Loved it! I also explored the Gardens by the Bay, the Shoppes and Clarke Quay nearby.",5
"We usually avoid such hotels, but this one was a must during our trip to Singapore. Although a tourist hype, the place is actualy comfortable and really nice once you're in the guest areas. Rooftop pool is almost always packed, but also a must.",5
"We stayed in Tower 3 on the 46 floor. Magnificent views from the room and from the infinity pool make this hotel worth staying at least once in a lifetime. WiFi works well, requested an extra blanket and got it in 10 minutes together with  two extra bottles of water. No tea or coffee provided, though there is a kettle in the room. If you don't want to leave a deposit of SGD 200, tell at the reception that you are not going to use a minibar. Wonderful experience. ",5
"I recently stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for 6 nights in October. I was commissioned to photograph at a Conference and the hotel charges were paid for by the client. When I checked out, I insisted on obtaining a statement from the hotel confirming that there were no extra charges during my stay. After insisting, they eventually supplied me with a printout saying: ‘TOTAL CHARGES - 00.00’. 5 days after I left, I checked my MasterCard Account and saw that £92.07 had been debited from my account by the hotel. I immediately emailed them for an explanation. 3 days later they replied saying ""we do apologize for the delays and inconvenience caused"" and that I will be credited with the £92.07 ………. there was no explanation whatsoever as to why this mistake had occurred.  They also…",1
"We chose to stay here for our last night in Singapore and it was the highlight of our holiday. We were kindly allowed to check in early and were also upgraded to a city view room upon arrival. The room was gorgeous offering a lovely view and exquisite facilities. We were also able to explore the Gardens by the Bay, the Shoppes and Clarke Quay nearby. Staff were friendly and provided exemplary service. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was breathtaking and made our stay at Marina Bay Sands relaxing, romantic and memorable.",5
"Everyone knows about the MBS infinity pool. You have to be a registered guest to access it, so I decided to splurge and stay here for one of my five nights in Singapore. The view from up there is amazing, especially at night! The rooftop bar turns into a lounge/mini club on the weekend. They charge a S$38 cover for entry on the and ladies initially get in free, but from my experience it's not worth the price. I had a king room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay, and it was slightly larger than your average hotel room. Service from all employees was wonderful. Both the casino and the mall attached are huge and you will want to spend some time walking through both. All of the food and drink prices are expensive, so be prepared for that. The gym was large and had new equipment.…",5
"We stayed just one night here but were blown away by the room that we were given (the receptionist, Elaine, was kind enough to let us check in early which made a huge difference to our trip) and the views of the Gardens On The Bay from the 40th floor were stunning.  The lobby area is a vast cathedral of light and a constant hum of people passing through make it a wonderful people watching spot ... easy access to the Bayfront Mall, Event Plaza for the amazing Light Show and MRT station make the location perfect and add to this a large room with gorgeous bathroom and dream bed adds up to a great stay.  The famous infinity pool on the 57th floor is not for the faint hearted but truly breathtaking and free entry for guests is a huge bonus.  The poolside service is a little hit or…",5
"A really awesome hotel all round, the architecture is amazing and facilities incredible.  We had a city view which looked over the lake onto the central business district and it was quite simply the most incredible view we have ever had from a hotel room. Easy access to the shops, casino, spa and not to mention the infiniti roof top pool and sky park. Simply astounding.  The only negative was that the skypark is not run by the same people so even though you are a resident the bars and restaurants at the top treat you like a person that has walked in off the street. So be sure to book a table, otherwise you have to stand and have a drink, in the rain potentially, like we did.  If your prepared to pay the price you will not regret it for short stays. I think a longer stay, when…",4
This hotel is gorgeous. I like skyscrapers and this one really sets itself apart from the other places I've been to. The infinity pool is one of the best in the world. Definitely worth staying at just to experience the luxury it provides.,5
"Booked one night in this amazing hotel! Booked in advance so we were sure we had a room. If we didn't do that, we had to wait for a long time.  Stayed on the 52th floor with city view. What an amazing hotel! Top notch. Living like a celebrity, walking around in you bathrope and matching shoes.  Very friendly and polite staff. Adress you wtih Sir or Mam. Ask you how your day is. One night is to short for living like a god in this hotel.",5
"A huge complex with endless restaurants and shops. The rooms are in a pleasing international contemporary style; the Orchard Suite was very roomy with high ceilings and a great view. Some ideas seem straight out of a handbook on supermarket marketing though, which frankly does not add to the experience, but overall a professionally run temple to consumism with some pretty unique features like the rooftop infinity pool.",5
"An amazing hotel, with everything you could need! Singapore was a great place to visit, but I think this hotel made the trip!! Really excited to go back, and will be spending more time by that incredible pool!",5
"My partner and I stayed at this architectural marvel of a hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted very warmly by the friendly staff. Check-in was a breeze. We even got upgraded, for free. The rooms are very tastefully decorated, and are very spacious. The pool on the skypark is to die for. Incredible views. Overall, fantastic experience. Definitely worth every penny. ",5
"We opted to stay at the Marina Bay Sands as a splurge at the start of our trip. Stayed here for a total of 3 nights. The hotel is simply amazing yet very expensive... but I think it is worth it for a couple of nights! Rooms are quite large and offer beautiful views of either the city or the bay (we had a bay view). Bathroom is lovely, althought water pressure was a bit of an issue from the shower, but that would be my only complaint. The pool.... this is what you stay at this hotel for! Absolutely stunning pool area on the top of the hotel, gives new meaning to a roof top pool. The view from up there is breath taking. It is a very busy place up there for obvious reasons but we never had any trouble getting a lounge. Cocktails and food is very expensive, but that's the price you…",4
As you can guess main high light of this hotel is the pool. Even with cloudy weather or rain you can't not be impressed. Was on our honeymoon and got a city view up grade which is always nice. Room was massive and had amazing views.,4
"Went to Cairns to visit my sister, and decided to break up the return journey with a visit to Singapore. Had already seen a programme on the Marina Bay and were determined to stay there. I know the exact type of room and tower I wanted to stay in, unfortunately our travel agent screwed that up, and on arrival we were told that that was not the type of room that had been reserved for us, no matter, withing a minute the fabulous girl on reception had found the correct room, but with a $400 dollar extra charge which we did not mind. The room, even the porter when he arrived with our bags said ' what a lovely room' The room overlooked the city and the lake, really nice. The pool on the roof was amazing, the service extremely professional, after just one visit, the next day the…",5
"If your budget will stretch a little, this motel is a must do, if only for a night. Spacious and clean room, early check in and a late check out was offered on checking in. Found all staff to be pleasant and helpful, couldn't  fault the buffet breakfast. The roof top pool is a must experience, but not your typical lay back resort style pool, a ground level pool and shade area would have been nice. Coffee making facilities in the room but no fresh milk provided, my only complaint.",5
"Amazing hotel, amazing view, amazing place to stay. Only draw back we found was room service as it was slow. And the entry gate isn't like a 7 star hotel it's very normal like a 3 star facilities are great. Over all worth the money paid. The pool is great and staff humble please do stay here at least one night if you are in Singapore ",4
"Stayed here a couple nights in May 2015. Comes with a heavy price but if you can swing it, it's worth it for the view at night. Marina Bay is electric and is a stunning sight from your window. Pool is popular and gorgeous. Very efficiently handled from check in throughout my stay. Convenient walk to Marina Bay, Arts and Science Museum, and Super Tree Grove. Wonderful memory.",5
"We stayed at MBS for 2 nights on our way back to Sydney from Europe and London. This hotel is amazing. Its huge. Three towers comprising some 2,500 rooms. We stayed on level 46 in a city view room. The room was huge with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city. The view is amazing. The bathroom was huge with a stand-alone bath and a shower big enough to swing a cat. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. The infinity pool is terrific, but busy. The entire top floor area behind the pool is so relaxing and is a great place to enjoy a drink, up high overlooking the city. The hotel is amazing but its the staff that make you want to return. They go out of their way to make your stay memorable. The staff clearly enjoy working there and it shows. Highly recommended. Will…",5
Staying at marina bay sand hotel for relaxation for couple of days I would say hotel services is good but have to pay additional S$100.00 per person for swimming in the rooftop pool which the last time I go they do not restrict at all which mean to say one room is entitled to two pax for pool and some other stuff the third pax onwards is chargeable. It is a good hotel to stay in but is quite expensive in certain way ,4
From the moment you check in you feel special.room on 38th floor was great. Had all we needed and more. Breakfast was very good with great waiting staff. My highlight was the infinity pool on the 57th and the reason for staying here. Did not disappoint. Watching the Singapore skyline light up at dusk was terrific... even better when it's from the 57th floor pool! Bucket list ticked!,5
"well it was on my bucket list and I will be forever grateful I included it its expensive but if you are smart you include The Club package as it provides b/fast afternoon tea,  and canapés at night with beverages/wine/spirits/beer and as we all know the beverage side of things in Singapore is very expensive but this package is definite value for money and the rooms that come with it are superb we asked for a balcony and were given a suite on the 28flr which was really quite excellent but me I need a balcony so eventually they succumbed although they could not understand why but anyway it was great we got the garden view and we loved it at night with all the lights .Ah the pool what can one say it was fantastic both day and night80 floors up and all the view you can want with bar…",5
This was our 3rd trip to Singapore and our 1st stay at Marina Bat Sands. It is more expensive than others but well worth it. The location is great as most attractions are walking distance and the Subway is at the basement so travel is very easy. All staff will do what they can for you and their attitude is great. The pool is fantastic as are teh views. Drinks are a little overpriced up the top at the pool but other than that we recommend staying here as you will not be sorry. Wifi is provided and can be access anywhere in the hotel! I will be here again on our 4th trip!,5
"I was enjoying a night with my friend birthday celebration for holiday. Pool was great, Room service and housekeeping is absolute fantastic and efficent, However front desk was on one of the worst service i ever encounter through a lady who spoke with attitude problem and cheap accent at tower 1 when my key card wasn't working hence was ignored when i stand in front of her out of all the front desk that was busy.",3
"We stayed in the room with bay view on fl 26. I think it could be the best view enough for the Garden by the bay too. Very comfortable beds. The swimming pool on top of tower 3 (fl 57) is smaller than I had imagined before I came but it has an amazing view indeed that's facing to the city, got smoking area facing to the bay view also!!! Should try both day and night swimming there. I did enjoy my time there.  From tower 1 you can easily get to Bayfront MRT. There are 2 ways to get to Garden by the bay: 1. Between tower 1 and 2 there is a skyway connecting to Garden by the bay (best choice), 2. Underground way from Bayfront MRT (I like the walls here so much).  In my experience, you should visit Garden by the bay in the morning to get better shots with the beautiful MBS Hotel…",5
"This was not a great business hotel, lots of day tourists walking through the lobby just to see as well as late in evenings coming from the various clubs. It is just to big to get nay sense of individual attention that one would expect. Service is great but overall experience lacks and is below expectation. ",3
"We stayed here on the last night of our trip having come from Pan Pacific Orchard. Luckily we were able to check in early (around 1o'clock) with 2 of the 3 rooms we booked receiving free upgrades. We had a huge (but unnecessary) balcony, the bed was big and extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was done out nicely - however no bath tub. Of course the pool was the standout feature that convinced us to stay here in the first place and I wasn't disappointed. Up to the 57th floor (!!!) and I was definitely not prepared for the view, i'd never seen anything like the juxtaposition of the pool next to the panoramic city views - it was amazing! The pool was very clean, though the water was cold that didn't stop us wading in once during the day and once at night to get our obligatory…",4
"We stayed in a club room towards the top of Tower 2, with the city view. The room was very large, with a great bathroom with free standing tub and a seperate walk in shower and a seperate toilet. The rooms main window goes from floor to ceiling and the curtains automatically open every time you enter the room, which is really quite cool, especially when you have the view over the city. The breakfast at The Club is really very good. There is pretty much everything you could wish for. There is also a great view, whether you sit on the city or the sea side of the tower. Of course, the infinity pool is not to be missed. It is just amazing to look out from the 57th floor over the city while taking a swim. This is really quite unique. There is also a souvenier photo service, if you…",5
"We have a staycation at the Sands during the first week of November.  We decided to take the Garden View as it came with a small balcony.    The hotel was accomodating with our request for early check in and for a high floor.  Checking in was a little slow as it was pretty croweded. The front desk staff did what need to be done and was a little impersonal.  We got to our deluxe room and the view of Gardens by the Bay, the Barrage, and the sea was amazing!  The room was very clean, modern and well thought out.  The Bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom was clean and luxerious, but the water pressure for the shower was a little low but that is due to the Hotel's green initiatve.  If you stay at the Sands, your must head to the Infinity Pool!  We went at night (which is less crowded)…",5
"The location is amazing, next to a shopping mall and the views are great at night.  but the rooms are old ! they need be refurbished, the sofa in the room is Old and looks dirty! i think they never changed it from the day they opened the hotel. the linen and towels are old ! the duvet is so thin and it looks so disgustingly old.  this is definitely not a 5* hotel and not worth the money. on the other hand the pool view from the top floor is amazing but there are so many people at the pool that you wont be able to enjoy it! there are 2600 rooms in the hotel so you could imagine! it look more like a shopping mall full of people rather than a 5* luxury hotel. Forgot to mention the pillows! HORRIBLE! and the linens were not even ironed properly. the management should  spend some…",2
"we were a group of 6, stayed only here for a night. spacious room the rest of the group slept on extra bed obviously, but the bed is not well proportioned for a big-size room. the bath is spacious too. don't touch what's on the fridge bcause automatically it will charge you. they are very strict with access to pool. I can't say anything much of course, it's beautiful especially the view from our room, but I don't like busy hotels. very far from everything even when you just want to buy something from the next building. Make sure you have everything you need before checking in unless you want to spend too much from room service.",4
"This hotel is just amazing! Before visiting it we have, of course, heard and saw a lot about Marina and we got high expectations from it and of course the reality succeeded all of them! The pool is so clean and the view is amazing. Everything was great, I could not think of anything negative about MBS. We stayed at MBS in 2012 and I could just never forget about it, I really have to visit it again because it's just one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at!",5
"Beautiful hotel inside and out with even the standard room being very nice. Service was also great and efficient. MRT station is literally under the hotel so it's easy to get there, and gardens by the bay is also connected, so there is plenty to see. The pool is as amazing as you would expect, it can be hard to get a seat at times and pretty much everyone is just up there to take photos and selfies!  As you would expect, everything in the hotel is expensive, but the Sands shopping centre is just next door where there is plenty of options for food and drinks.  Worth staying to enjoy the pool and the marvelous views, but don't break the bank staying any longer and try different parts of Singapore. Would recommend to anyone who hasn't been and would definitely go back if I had the…",4
"On my last holidays I stayed at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore to check the hotel service and of course the infinity swimming pool, which is the reason why too many people go there just to stay overnight and enjoy the highest swimming pool on the world. The check-in and check-out are really very organised and the staff are very polite. They start any conversation asking you sorry for any delay, even if you didn't wait any second for the service. The bedroom is a 5 Star Hotel bedroom, you can find everything you need for your stay and have a very good night sleep. The Gym is just a hotel gym equipped with basic fitness equipments, mostly treadmills. If you wish you can also pay and enjoy the hotel spa service. At Rise Restaurant, the breakfast is amazing. A little different from…",5
May be good for the business traveller but we had 3 little ones with us including a new born. No complaints on service or the rooms (which are big). It's just the sheer scale of the building and how it's layed out that you almost feel like being at a busy airport terminal or a train station! There's nothing personal about your stay. Yes the pool on the top floor and the location with gardens by the bay at your doorstep is great but think again if you got kids with you. We checked in for 3 nights but checked out after the first to move to Shangrila and there we found all the personal attention and kid friendliness that we were missing here!  ,3
"the hotel is really beautiful ,perfect pool ,rooms are vry nice ,perfect view ,many restaurant to eat ,but do not expect a 5 stars services ,it is kind of las vegas service but it is very expensive ,, the hotel is full with tourist ,so it is not a must to offer best services ,but it is a must to visit hotel ,i really like it it is my 5th time staying here ..",4
Got a High-level room facing The Garden By the Bay. Great scenery. Room was spacious and toilet big and nice. Have dinner at the Satay Club which was a long walk from the hotel but the walk was worth it.,5
"Excellent stay, beautiful room (deluxe garden view). We were fortunately allowed to check in early, bonus!! Quick IMPORTANT tip. We came straight from an apartment so had a bunch of stuff to put in the fridge. We didn't read the sign on the fridge...oops...In the mini bar there are sensors under all the food and drinks and you are auto charged immediately for anything removed. We had to do a bit of quick talking to concierge to explain that we hadn't just eaten and drank everything in the fridge in the first 10mins!!! The pool of course is awesome and we got to keep our keys as a souvenir. We stayed on the 34th floor which was great and we were able to get the same view of the city/marina just but walking across to the lift where there is a massive window. Another thing is that…",5
"We had a splurge and stayed two nights in this hotel so we could swim in the pool as only guests can swim. The pool was a little cold but the view was outstanding. We enjoyed breakfast in the Skybar each morning-smaller variety of food than downstairs, we were told, but plenty to keep us happy! We had an 8 PM  flight, but despite 2 requests, we  could only get checkout extended to 1 PM. Room 4908 in tower 3 was lovely - up high and in the corner. We loved that the room curtains opened automatically when you put your key in the power slot. The Internet was very slow and kept dropping out-disappointing for a hotel of this class. This is a very big, very busy Hotel-spotless  and very impressive. We enjoyed the experience but wouldn't stay again -  you can get better value and…",4
"Everything is super expensive here so bring plenty of money!!! Room was great but so it should be with a $500/night price tag. No extras though, no fruit nothing which is a bit sad. Out TV didn't work 3 days in a row so had to have the Technician come and sort it. We ate at 3 Celebrity restaurants; Pizzeria & Osteria Mozza & Spago, all great dining experiences food wise however very very expensive. Mad prices!!! Service at Spago was poor which was disappointing. Pool has great views, fairly crowded though. Very touristy and busy on the lobby floor. Had High Tea at Jin Shaun Lou which was appalling, average food and shockingly slow thick service. I am surprised a restaurant of that poor standard is in the building. Would only recommend staying one night if you must go............",3
"Wonderful luxury in the heart of Singapore! It's connected directly to the MRT and a taxi ride costs around $15 to the airport.   I stayed for my birthday and Amit at check in used his initiative and provided us with a free room upgrade. The room was enormous and had a brilliant view of the gardens by the bay (even more spectacular at night).   Everyone at the complex was knowledgeable and friendly (except inside the casino)  The pool of course is a highlight. They bring you drinks and food. I stayed there all day! It was just a view of Singapore that could not really be matched anywhere else. (Again, spectacular in the evening). The only weird thing is that no food is served until 10am - but you can have cocktails!  Another highlight is the gym. It's located a couple of floors…",5
Worlds longest rooftop pool. Worlds highest cantilevered viewing deck. Has a Wolfgang Puck Spago on top as well as a multi meal and nightlife bar Flight & nightclub Cie la Vie,5
"First impressions during check-in were not great. The lobby was crowded and noisy, and the lines for check-in were pretty long. I felt like I was in the lobby of a regular resort not unlike those in the neighbouring islands. For the price of the room, it is also strange that the check-in time at the hotel is unusually late (3pm), while the check-out time is unusually early (11am). I found out later that guests are allowed to check in earlier (I cannot be sure how much earlier), but this was not conveyed to us. It may well be that the late check-in time stated is meant as a form of crowd control, but I do not think this is fair to guests who are unaware and may just be milling around waiting for 3pm, especially given the amounts that people are shelling out to stay here.  Having…",3
"The hotel is amazing! But the wait time for the key was super long! We waited almost an hour before we got our keys! We travelled as a family from HK and we have 13 people. We booked several rooms but all of them are in different towers, I stayed in tower 3 with my mom. It was a very pleasant stay, our view was stunning! We were overlooking the Singapore Garden! We also really enjoyed the infinity pool! I like the idea on only the people who stay at this hotel can access to the pool. Its already very crowded! Overall it's a very nice experience and we stayed there for 2 nights! It has a casino in the mall just right beside the hotel so you can do some gambling before resting in your own room~",5
"Just finished our stay here for 2 nights on route to phuket from australia. 1st bit of advice don't hesitate to get a taxi from the airport to here as taxi's in singapore are probably the only place in the world where they're cheap and clean. We only paid $15 singapore. Secondly the advice i would give is go for the cheapest room and tag the buffet breakfast on. We paid for a really nice view on level 49 and it was amazing, but we spent most the time outside the room and up on the skypark at the top in all the bars and restaurants where the view was amazing. The only time we were in the room was to sleep. Overall this hotel is incredible and next time in singapore we would book no where else.",5
"Was gifted this room as a wedding gift about 4 years ago. 2 nights of paradise. Room was nicely spaced, high bed, view was AWESOME. Pool was magnificent, we had the chocolate buffet at level 57 too. Jacuzzis were good but always taken. Good things comes to those who wait ;)  Checkout was a breeze with the drop-key option. Will be back.",5
The hotel is located at a location that you can't wait for. The Hotel is amazing & awesomely created. Has 3 Towers. Beautiful Pool & View from the Observation Deck on the 57th Floor is killing. Has over 100 brands & restaurants at the Shoppes. A must  stay & watch once in a lifetime.,5
"The hotel is very big and impressive in many ways, from the spacious reception and foyer area, to the well appointed rooms which have an amazing view either over the city or out to sea over the light garden. Take a swim in the infinity pool on the roof with the most amazing views of the Singapore harbour. We only stayed one night as it is not cheap, but a great experience that you do once in a lifetime.",4
"On arrival I was just astonished at the sheer scale of this hotel.  As one of the porters said, 'it's like three hotels in one'.  We arrived early (3.30AM) and whilst our room wasn't ready, they did their best to try to find a solution.  Alas to no avail.    So we witnessed residents rounding off their evenings as well as those getting up early for breakfast.....I've never witnessed a busier hotel lobby/breakfast restaurant.  That might well put some people off but they are uber-efficient and the queues seem to be dealt with really quickly.  That said, we chose breakfast in bed.  Much more relaxing and in comparison, worth a little bit extra for a peaceful start to the day.  When we were given our room at about 12.30, it was worth the wait.  We booked a city view and they gave…",4
"They could not deliver the 3 twin rooms that were booked months in advance.  Two rooms had extra beds provide, hardly room to move, nothing else available, place definitely overcrowded everywhere.  The infinity pool and Sky Park were a hit with our teenage grandsons.  Housekeeping staff very helpful with extra amenities when needed. Summary of hotel bill looked OK.  On returning home I checked our Mastercard only to find that we were charged twice for our stay, in other words overcharged us by $7,000 - still trying to get them to credit this huge amount, really spoilt an otherwise wonderful experience with my family.",3
"It's definitely worth spending a little bit extra for a city view room - the view from the bed is unbelievable. Swimming pool needs no introduction, and the first time I walked on the 'deck' it was impossible not to smile with amazement.   Negatives: -Room itself is nothing special -Long queue for the check-in process, feels like an airport -Swimming pool a bit cold",4
"With a morning to spare, I decided to visit this local attraction. Built on land reclaimed from the sea, this is the most amazing place. The viewing deck dwarfs the Singapore Flier. The views are stunning over the whole of Singapore and the Straits. The gardens are amazing and I would regard this as the best attraction in the wonderful city. ",5
overnight here for 3 nights during ITB Singapore. Room is really big and it is real pleasure to stay here once in a life time. Connected to shopping arcade and promenade. Roof top is free for hotel guest.,4
"This is a hotel you do not have to leave  On club level you get a big room with a big bathroom with a bath  Included in your room is Breakfast, afternoon tea & happy hour but get there early  Top shelf drinks and they do not hold back on quantity  Pool is great but shallow all over",4
"The views were stunning from all places of the hotel. The furniture is old, bruised and battered for quite a new hotel. The bathroom looks old-dated. The hotel is very crowded. The breakfast 'room' on the roof is too small for all guest. Simple breakfast. Great nightclub and great spa!",4
"If your only going to be in singapore once then it worth a stay just to say youve been. Pool is amazing, view that cant be beaten. We had 3 people in one room and the third had a foldout bed which was a little disapointing but was still comfee",4
"We decided to treat ourselves to 2 nights here.  Firstly check in took over 20 mins, you felt as if you were queuing for a ride a Disneyland! Having said that the staff member who checked us in was very polite and tried very hard to make up for this fact.  The room itself was very nice, huge bathroom, clean and tidy. However we had one full day without any hot water!  The main attraction being the pool for this hotel was mightily disappointing. Not enough beds by far and ignorant people left wet towels on beds for hours which were never removed and therefore not allowing people who actually wanted to relax there, able to. Food and especially drinks were very expensive by the pool. Only saving grace here was that they were hot on no children in the adult area. The view is great…",3
"Spacious rooms, big beds, duvet covers, awesome views either the city, gardens by the bay, or merlion, you wont go wrong with booking this hotel even once in your life.  The staff at the front desk is very polite even there's a crowd waiting to check in.   Weekends are quite overcrowded.   The infinity pool is superb. With just the right amount of temperature, you will enjoy this experience be it at the morning, (they open at 7am) until 10pm in the evening.  You can enjoy the view of Singapore at night, and you can watch the OCBC light show at GBTB at 0730 PM.",4
Marina bay perhaps is the most iconic building now in Singapore...that's why the price is a bit overpriced for such normal luxurious hotel. The beds were really comfortable but the bathroom is normal. The hotel is really really huge that's why I don't feel exclusive despite paying 300 dollars for a night! The infinity pool though was a lifetime experience :),3
"Absolutely stunning views, especially from the skypark, had the pleasure of staying on the 51st floor and being able to see the laser show from the room gave us a spectacular view. If you visit Singapore, this is a must stop. Totally worth the price for the stay.",5
This hotel is huge with 3 towers... Each with 57 floors. The check in terrible as with any large hotel. The break fast queues are unimaginable. But the rooms are large... I had good view of the bay.the infinity pool and the deck on 57 th floor are great. The mall with casino is a great attraction.,4
Good hotel! Rooms are spacious and well maintained. Staff is clear about all they speak and they are polite too. And its infinite pool is AMAZING. However its to expensive. Its food is healthy and delecious too. Even if someone say me that its a bad hotel I would thing he/ she is a abnormal person. ,5
"Given the looks of the hotel and the presence of infinity pool, you may definitely want to try this hotel. However, in my personal opinion, the infinity pool is a bit of overhype and extremely crowded. Apart from being on the 57th floor, I don’t see much to it. However the hotel is as grand as it can be.  We stayed at Tower 3 of the hotel. There are lots of shopping options in the basement of the hotel. The Cloud Forest, Gardens by the Bay and other attractions are close by.  Even though the hotel has around 2500 rooms, check in and check out are not that time consuming.  It is little funny to note that the rooms are separated at places just by planks (may be wooden). You can hear the phone ringing in the adjoining rooms and bathrooms. I could even hear people talking from…",4
If you want your wallet to be raped by all means. Its $100 a person to get more than 2 keys per room. Hotel very overprices! No no no! Worst money i have ever spent! They charge for every little detail.  Im sure for oxygen as well! No no no no don't do it ,1
"Among tons of luxury/high class 5 stars hotels I ever stayed, this is the worst experience I ever had. The cheapest room cost around USD330 but the service is just like 2 stars hotel, maybe even worse.  Marina Bay Sands is known for its infinity pool and great view. Indeed, it's amazing but that it. I choose to check in MBS for the first day of my Singapore trip. But it totally ruined my first expression to Singapore. I can't tell what kind of service they provide but please don't suffer it. It's not worth of it.  Here is the story..  Due of Singapore Airline suddenly changed my flight to ETA 4:30am So I was exhausted and really want to take a rest upon check in. I reached MBS around 7:30am and was trying to ask what time can I possibly check-in in a polite way The only answer I…",1
"The Marina Bay Sands is one of the symbols of Singapore. The building is iconic, the infinity pool view well-known, and the Marina Bay area itself full of world class shops and restaurants. If you're coming here you should be prepared for a Disneyland-style experience: tons of tourists from around the world all here for the same experiences you've come for. It's not a boutique experience in the slightest. All of that said, the Marina Bay Sands is a must-stay for anyone who is a hotel fan... this is one of the premiere properties in the world. You have to see it to believe it.   Despite the crowds, the hotel is very well managed. Staff from top to bottom are exceptionally friendly and well trained--Singapore hospitality on another level, for sure. From the concierge to the towel…",5
"Marina Bay Sands, so what's the fuzz about. Well, beside the world's highest infinite pool, there are more to it. I stayed in the premium view room for three nights and enjoyed every moments.  Pro: - Number one on the list have to be the infinite pool. It is just amazing and glorious. Not a lot of people swim in it because everyone just care about selfies there.  - Location. It is in the centre of attraction with a casino and a huge mall that aim for the rich as well as the not so rich. Really nice  - Service was excellent as I would expect in a five star resort.  - No sign of wear and tear, still like a brand new hotel  Con: The price might be on a higher side, but you pay what you get.  Other than price, I can't think of any other negative thing about this hotel. So go and…",5
"What can I say about this Hotel???? Fantastic, stayed in Tower 2 on 26th floor, large room with all you could want in it, very quiet, clean and spacious ,great  view of the gardens, very attentive and helpful staff there at all times, had dinner in Rise Buffet on Ground floor, plenty of choice and all cooked to perfection. Rooftop infinity pool is to die for with views to match. Not cheap paid 18 S dollars for 2 small bottles of Fiji water by the  pool£9 in our money.... a bit steep, but hey only here once. Hope to visit again. Enjoy.",5
"Had a staycation here, though the queue for checking in is long, but it is moving fast. Hotel is very accessible, near MRT(Bayfront), within shopping centres and walking distance to almost anywhere! Also near attraction visits(SG Flyer).  Room was facing Gardens by the Bay. The view is magnificent! Balcony was big enough.   Swam at the raved about Infinity pool. Can't deny the view overlooking the buildings in Singapore. But be prepared as it's crowded in the afternoon.  WIFI connection is also fast!  Only thing is that the toilet door cannot be locked and there's no bidet in the toilet. Fridge is also full and is chargeable if we remove an item by the sensor! So can't put our drinks inside but there is additional $10 charge if you want to rent the mini fridge.   Overall…",4
"It's bloody expensive but your trip will just not be complete without a night here. Sure, you could stay somewhere else and pay the ~$20 to visit the Skypark instead but you'll always be wondering about that infinite pool.   It really is worth it, especially if you're lucky enough to score an upgrade. The first time we stayed here we got a huge apartment which was probably as big as my house. ",5
We stayed here to celebrate my friends birthday. The room is spacious. And the beds are quite big compare to a normal hotel that we have stayed in here in Singapore.  The facilities and amenities in the room are quite new and modern. Its a bit pricey but its worth the lay for the experience. ,4
"The Marina Bay Sands gives you everything you've paid (a lot) for - stunning rooftop infinity pool, luxuriously large and well-appointed rooms and staff who cannot do enough to help you. We arrived at 7am on the day of our check-in, and although our room wasn't ready, our bags were checked and we were given passes to use the spa, gym and rooftop infinity pool immediately, which we were really impressed by - the rooftop pool is the best place to get used to the buzz of Singapore!  It's amazing, but very very crowded and so it can be a bit difficult to enjoy the lovely facilities as much as you would like. That said, it's an awesome place to stay and I'd highly recommend it.",5
"Stayed here two nights and loved every minute of it. Our room was on the 40th floor in tower 1 and faced south with a fantastic view of the Gardens by the Bay. The room was huge with an equally huge bathroom that included a large free standing bath tub, massive shower room, separate toilet and twin vanity. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was stunning in every way, and during our stay, we were pleased it wasn't too busy so finding a good poolside spot was easy. It was hard to imagine you were up that high as it had a beautiful beach resort feel to it and was beautifully lit at night, such a lovely place to be. We found the hotel staff very friendly despite the hustle and bustle, this is not a place to visit for a quiet tranquil stay. Restaurant prices were exorbitant as to be…",5
" Brilliant service, great hospitality, beautiful view, exquisite food options and mind blowing infinity pool clearly makes this one  of the best hotels in Singapore.   Roof top club Ce la vi - one of the best clubs in Singapore offers a great option to party till late (almost 3am on weekdays and 4.30 am on weekends) They also have casino on the first and second floor and a premier lounge on the 3rd floor.  A must visit- for non Singapore resident doesn't have to pay any fees to enter the casino )  ",5
"Amazing hotel, so much more to it than just the room!!  Pool was amazing with breath taking views of Downtown and beyond, as far as the eye can see.  Everyone very friendly, and will do whatever they can to help you.  We had a city view room, which was lovely!! Great sized room and bathroom.  The hotel and its grounds (which go for miles) are a piece of art.  We stayed for three nights, and would of happily stay longer if possible.  Banyan Tree Spa facilities fantastic ++++ Would highly recommend!  You can tell the pool is the main attraction and is luckily restricted to hotel guests only, although its always busy, not a pool to relax at. Also, the main lobby/ atrium is alway very busy ++ as this is open to the public.    These aren't complaints, just observations.  Brilliant…",5
"Hotel is amazing and gives you a feeling you will never get in other places, the rooms had an amazing view and the service was out standing. staying at the hotel will allow you to get to places like the roof top pool and more, not sure I would stay there on a business trip, the hotel provides so much it is hard to work :-)",5
This hotel is wonderful. The view from the room is amazing. The location is great and the food at the breakfast buffet is delicious. The mall and casino are attached.  Cabs are plentiful and even with the crowd--hotel is huge--it was quick to get them. The pool is a must see.,4
"Fabulous service throughout. Received an upgrade on checking in, to a suite and my room overlooked the Gardens by the Bay. Stunning room and view. It was a very thunderstormy night, so I sat in my living area sofa, glass of wine in my hand an watched the Garden's light change colour with accompanying music in the night. I hadn't seen anything like it before. Had room service, a steak and bottle of wine, which tasted absolutely fantastic. It added another $100 to my bill on checkout (pre-tax). Had a manicure and pedicure onsite, which set me back another $100. Lobby area is absolutely packed.  Overall, I enjoyed it but its an indulgent stay.",5
"This was one of the best hotels I've stayed in, the view from the top and the pool was amazing and all the staff very friendly. The wifi I'm areas apart from rooms wasnt great but the views make up for this",5
"Ok there's cheaper hotels and you may be thinking will I or won't I? Even if it's a one night stay in a cheaper room it may be time to cross this one off the bucket list, you deserve it!  The above may sound like an advertising spiel but that was the though process I went through before deciding to stay here. We had to change our plans from a Bali trip due to the volcano and flight cancellations. We always wanted to return to Singapore and after going through the stressful time of changing everything at the last minute I was ready for some indulgence - this was it.  Check in was at 3pm however we arrived at around 11.30am with the idea of looking around first. Our bags were whisked away as soon as we left the cab and were met at the entry. We were told the bags will be in our…",4
"Welcome to Las Vegas in Singapore!! This is and make no mistake a Casino hotel in every way, a money making and people processing machine. It is an inspiring architectural sight to see inside and out, walk through even if you don't stay but not relaxing for me, just too busy. The shopping Mall it sits above is huge, clean, shiny and priced as one would expect but worth seeing. Check in and out times are strict, but thats ok, it was expected, very well explained on check in and pool keys are provided and bags looked after if you are early which we were allowing us to explore. There are plenty of helpful smiling staff to guide you to the right area too enhancing the experience no end. This was an extravagant wish list option fulfilled and we stayed in a Club Room Suite. Our room…",3

"If you are visiting Singapore then add MBS to your must see list. It's one of those places where you get lost in magnificence. An engineering wonder, a ridiculous masterpiece and that's just the architectural part, there's so much more to do. ",5
"Relatively expensive hotel and the service was lackluster. No bell man until we tracked one down at the counter, check in line was almost an hour and had no personal flavor to it at all. Check out impersonal as well, but at least fast since we could drop the cards off without waiting in line.  The pool view was amazing and maybe worth it for a night but even the pool area had wet and dirty towels all over it, no one was cleaning up.  There was lots of upsell everwhere too, food, pictures at the pool, etc.  Location is ok but not as centrally located as other hotels.   Rooms were large and nice with good views.  Overall, if you want to go for a day in the pool and a nice view go for a night. Otherwise not worth it.",2
"Excellent service. I stayed in Tower 3 and enjoyed a breathtaking view of the bay. The room confortable, large, with a confortable bed and a living room and huge bathroom. Warm lighting and fresh smell. Breakfast buffet with many choices and spacious venue. Infinite pool worth the trip!",5
"Stayed in this hotel for a week as part of a conference. My wife joined me there as well. The hotel is massive, impressive, sometimes overwhelming, beautiful, full of selection and full of people. There are something like 60+ eating options in the hotel and connected shopping center and events center. The shopping center has stores that are primarily on the higher end of the range, but also has some more budget-friendly shops. The roof-top pool and bars are WORLD CLASS for the views and the experience.   If you goal is to spend time seeing sights in Singapore, this might not be the best hotel because it is a bit removed from the city. Singapore is not a big place so nothing is too far, but there are other options where you can walk outside the hotel and be in the city. This…",4
"Stayed 2 nights in tower 3. Wow, massive room with amazing bathroom. Room over looked botanical gardens.   Great location with direct access to the marina area. Shops & restaurants next door.   Pool fabulous.   Dined at Ce la vie and food was great. Bar area with live music too!  Overall great stay in iconic hotel",5
"Although it is a while since I stayed here, I am compelled to write about it as I am still overwhelmed by the space. The hotel is big, in fact, its like three separate hotels bridged together by what looks like a boat on the roof. Great dining spaces, shopping and bars fill the huge lobby which takes a good 10 minutes to walk along.   The bedrooms are clean, a good size, with excellent amenities and views. The rooftop club/bar is great for drinking whilst admiring the skyline and lights across Singapore. The pool is where it gets crazy, it is in an infinity pool to eclipse all infinity pools. With 55 floors to get to the top, you literally feel on top of the world and its a little bit scary when you get to the edge and look over.   I had some room service whilst at the hotel,…",4
"The only place to stay in SIngapore, it is the top in the city, it is The City!!! Amazing pool  skypark with an unforgettable skyline, luxory hotel with superior rooms, big shopping center and great show in the evening!!!",5
"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands as the first stop on our honeymoon.  The booking process was relatively simple and we were able to arrange a club suite room.  I mentioned twice during the booking process that the stay was part of our honeymoon. When we arrived we checked in and our honeymoon wasn't acknowledged by the check in desk, at each other hotel we stayed at this was at least done which is a small but nice touch that leads to a positive experience.  We arrived at the room and within the information in the room a honeymoon package was advertised which was disappointing because if I had of known that this was available it would have been somethingI would have purchased. This was the exact reason why I mentioned that it was a honeymoon booking during the emails…",2

"Bumped a lot of x-colleagues  here which makes me feel home. A different kind of city hotel which brings an excellent view of Marina Bay and Kallang River, extraordinaire buffet at ""Rise"" restaurant with International spread. Kudos to Food and Beverage team for GREAT service.",5
"If you come to Singapore do yourself a treat and stay here. Even though is a very big hotel, the service is very fast. Chec in and check out are pretty expedite. Is connected to a big mall with great restaurantes. It has a good bed and great amenities. The gym is spectacular and the infinite pool is an experience by itself. The views from restaurants the sky walk are wonderful. I recommend the hop in hop off bus. There is no traffic in Singapore even when raining so I suggest to give it a try. Also to walk around the city. Is very safe and not that big. Also suggest the botanical gardens and any show you can get because is a great destination for international musicals and events.",5
"I visited Marina Bay Sands with my boy friend. I just love the worlds longest elevated swimming pool. It soars silently towards the heavens, arriving in a heartbeat. when I woke up at 9 the hotel smelled something different you will feel like you are in heaven. Row of palm tree looks so amazing. The endless up and down along a black line, stroke, stroke, breathe. Turn and repeat. Awesome experience of my life..........",5
"Click & Book immediately.  Do not worry about looking at any other hotel.  This hotel is immaculate and central to everything.  You will be staying at this iconic building with a spectacular view, unbelievable infinity pool and being able to walk to the Marina Shoppes and Gardens by the bay.  If you need to go anywhere else, getting a taxi is so simple from the hotel.  It was a pleasure staying at here and I will be coming back in the near future.",5
"The views here are magnificent on either the garden or city side. Obviously the higher floors are better. The pool is fantastic with attentive and courteous staff.  It is a huge place so not a feeling of warmth but with great rooms, great pool and great views can't ask for much more. When you do need to engage with staff however they are very friendly.",5

"My wife and I stayed here for one night (her birthday) as part of our trip around SE Asia. When we checked in the woman taking care of us asked if it was our first time, if we were celebrating anything in particular, and I told her that it was my wife's birthday today. She immediately went to work upgrading us to a suite, which was totally unexpected! (and awesome).   Needless to say, my wife was extremely happy - the suite (located in a corner of Tower 3 on a middle floor) was beautiful, clean, had great views and amenities. But I feel the best attraction is the outdoor infinity pool on the rooftop. Absolutely stunning, especially at night when the crowds die down. I do wish that the poolside service could be a bit better, as some of the attendants didn't seem to be paying…",5
"what a beautiful place to stay! I spent the first 5 nights of a business trip to Singapore at the Marriott, which was another great hotel, but wanted to try the Marina Bay Sands because of all the great reviews. It truly is an amazing hotel. The pool alone is reason enough to stay there. It's a nice touch that sections of the pool are ""adults only""!",5
"I'm seriously unsatisfied with MBS' Car Management Department.  Reason being, the staffs are simply treating us with an extremely poor attitude. They  are so irresponsible! To the extent that i find there's a great need to specially name out their names to prevend anyone who's coming to MBS in future will face the similar problem given by them, to me.  The first staff's name is MR Aw Beng Seng (known as Steven on his name tag).  On the 9th of October 2015, due to some unluckiness, i encountered some issues with the redeemption of the parking coupon with the use of my MBS lifestyle member card.

My wife brought my kids for a swim and my son had a minor accident outside the pool area. He stepped on a small object which was not even and had a splinter on his foot. The lifeguard on duty was not able to remove the splinter and the hotel did not have a doctor on duty to assist. He was sent to the lifeguard and then to the Security but none of them could assist in removing the splinter. I cannot possibly imagine that an international 5 star hotel cannot help my son on a small splinter and he had to be sent to a private hospital to get it removed. The cost of the accident was not paid by the hotel and my wife had to settle this on her own.  I strongly hope that the hotel can look into this issue and ensure that the lifeguards are more trained to handle and resolve these…,2
"My daughter and I splurged at the MBS this month and were lucky enough to be given a room upgrade to the 39th floor with city view's.  We were a last minute booking having signed up to the website deal that offers cheaper rates so the upgrade made up for the odd booking process we experienced.  The email with the website offer came two days after I signed up, with an offer that expired on the sign up date (2 days prior).  In order to honour the rate I was asked to print, scan and email back a form to authorise credit card payment.  I'm not sure how many travelers have capacity to print and scan forms on the road, but they ended up holding the booking for me for payment on arrival when I pointed this out.  Pool was magnificent.  Crowded and wifi was limited on the roof but we…",4
"Arrived on a Tuesday, fast check in to a club room.  Architecture in lobby is fantastic.  Inclusive Club afternoon tea and breakfast was very good with a wide selection, with views north and south of Marina.  Had seen reports of a jam packed pool although in the afternoon and 1st thing in the morning (6:30am) that we went, there were only a few people and at one point I was the only person in the pool ;).  The mall is literally off a side passage from the lobby as is the MRT train links.  Was initially reluctant to pay the money for the club upgrade seeing was enough for the room already, however was completely smitten with an iconic Singapore stay.  ",5
"The hotel is fantastic, you can do so much inside the hotel itself! High-end shopping (all expensive and mid-range brands i could think of), food tripping, etc. The location is good as well; it is near the Singapore Flyer, bay area and food markets. But my most favorite is the pool! Oh by the way,  they are very systematic...from the moment you check-in,  breakfast buffet, pool entrance and the fastest check out ever.",4
"Stayed 2 nights at MBS bridal suite. The room is big and clean with an excellent view of Garden by the bay ....night view is superd! Room service is fast and staff are polite. Dining staff are also very helpful. To sum up, our stay is great!",5
"The staff was very friendly and helpful. They upgraded us to a city-view room from a garden room for free since it was our first stay and provided anything that we needed throughout the whole stay. The rooms were SPOTLESS, and the infinity pool is well worth seeing!!   The check-in process, however, made you feel like 1 in a large herd. It was a bit frustrating, but getting to the room made it all worth it.",5
"came back again , perhaps the fourth time ... upgraded to a suite   Best hotel in the world ! One of the best swimming pool in the world .. Gardens by the bay is a rare treat   Employee Wangelin Sum is superb in customer service ...",5
had heard a lot about the Marina bay Sands hotel...so it was a must visit....well every thing about the hotel was grand...  Have a few reservations though: 1) the hotel being a tourist destination feels tooo crowded at all times. 2) the adjoining shopping plaza adds to the crowd.. 3) the roof top on the 57th floor gives an awesome view and on weekends you will find half of singapore on the roof... :)  Good parts are: 1) the restaurant on the 57th floor 2) the casino... big and spacious with smoking allowed inside on the base floor.,4
"Booked direct on the website and was around SGD300/night (not including brekky). The pool was fabulous but the water is a bit chilly for me, so I stayed in the warm jacuzzi for a long time. Room has lots of amenities and the view was fantastic. Check in was very easy, flight arrived very early at 5am, couldn't check in yet but they let me go to the pool and stay there. I got my swim gear from the suitcase and enjoyed myself until the room was ready. Try and ask for higher floor :) the gym was awesome too, overlooking the bay. Would definitely go back next time I am in Singapore. ",5
"Okay, yes, this is a spectacular hotel.  The view from the Skypark is incredible; you get to see all of Singapore from the top for S$23 if you're not a guest.  Okay, that's it for the praise...  Being a gambler from Vegas and Atlantic City, I came here for the casino.  Love my slots; however, they didn't have any of the slots I've always played.  Plus, the first machine I put my money in, didn't work; had to wait over an hour just to get an attendant.  Even asked over 10+ staff people to help me; they were all as useless as a doggy bag with holes.  And as I was writing this awful review on Tripadvisor I finally got an attendant to get my S$50 back; this was a sign that I was not going to play here ever.     And the only time I got free wifi here is when u r a guest; I was able…",2
"Dear Marina Bay Sands,  I must give my deep gratitude to your Security Team.  At 04:00 am, me and my wife have forgotten a bag (with money and documents) in a taxi in front of your hotel. These men gave us a great help finding the taxi driver on phone by searching the veicle on cameras and he came back with the our bag.  They was very kind and full of courtesy and professional.  Thank you for choosing your team so good and see at the next trip.",5
"We checked in about 7pm after a wonderful stay at Hard Rock Sentosa. We were expecting big things of this hotel. We clearly hadn't done our research and it wasn't helped by Expedia not advising of the local taxes to be added. This could not have come at a worse time as we'd just had problems with our cards being cloned/froze. Also we'd not had to pay anything in Sentosa so this was a massive surprise. Check in took a while and I'll be honest, I didn't feel welcomed at all. Was not what I expected. We were in tower 1 - getting to the pool was a right palaver! The only good thing was the mrt station being a short walk away as there was nothing else here for us. I wouldn't recommend this hotel and I wouldn't stay again. The view from the Skypark is just as good as the pool.…",1
"The rooftop experience and the views from the rooms are stunning and top notch. The club staff were also very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this to anyone travelling to Singapore - but would recommend you consider limiting your stay to one day and night - and bask in the full rooftop experience.  The price of the room was not reflected in the service of the hotel staff (club lounge staff excluded), nor in the quality of the amenities. You can only swim in the pool if you are a guest of the hotel-so I felt over a 5 day period we were paying too much for the pool facilities. We didn't use it every day so didn't get value for money.  Also, if you are travelling with children, the pool (while stunning, amazing, and worth a visit) is quite small and crowded with adults - if…",4
"Enjoyed the stay , good conference venue, can enjoy theatre if interested, entertainment available, difficult to get early check in or late check out... Branded shopping available , can walk around if wanted, infinity pool view is amazing especially at sun rise and sun set,,,,stayed in this hotel 3 times for the same conference and found  similar service every time..2011, 2013 and  2015",4
"Marina Bay Sands is an architectural curiosity that parallels Singapore.  With skyline pools and restaurants, plus a range of five star eateries, basement shops, casino, food stalls, this is a city in itself!  Handy to the airport, MRT, and the river district, this is an excellent hotel option for your Singapore visit.",4
"MBS, upgraded my room, from Club, to Suite. My wife, was totally 'stunned', amazed, delighted..  My 2.5 year old son, enjoying running, playing in the room for hours, and reluctantly went to bed.  The environment was marvellous, room was PERFECT! staffs were friendly...  Will go back again, that's for sure! My wife is a frequent traveller, and now, MBS is at the TOP of her list.",5
Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one of the landmark in Singapore. The hotel was great with nice view and infity pool overlooking to the city. If you love swimming in their infinity pool you must check-in in this hotel because the swimming pool is exclusive for the hotel guest only.,5
"It was my 2nd stay but I wouldnt go back again. The pool was infested with a lot of people (typically from one country), and therefore there was no place to soak in water , nor to have a peaceful time. I saw a cigarette butt in the pool as well. Wonder how did it even happen?",2
As a couple we spent 1 night here on our 5 month trip around Asia & Australia for a little bit of luxury & as my partner is an Architect we were both very interested in this structure .. We stayed in Tower 2 with a Garden View .. We thought as we were in the Infinity pool looking at the City by day & evening in the bars .. It was nice to have the Gardens by the Bay & the Singapore Straights view with all the different ships & cruise ships .. Also we watched the Sun come up with that view... Strangely enough the rooms with the Garden view are cheaper... We had breakfast in our room with the patio doors open looking at the early morning comings & goings of the Straights.. Just wonderful .. The only negative for us was that whilst relaxing by the pool the music being played was not…,5
Returned to the hotel prior to a cruise in celebration of our 42nd wedding anniversary. This is the 3rd time there all of them being around our anniversary date. The past two times our celebration was not even mentioned despite it being noted on the booking. This time however they not only acknowledged it but went above and beyond providing us with an upgrade from a club room to an Orchid suite and delivering a beautiful cake to our room. Staff were friendly and the room was beautiful. One point worthy of note is that since our last visit the Club has since early this year been moved from the 57th floor overlooking the pool area to the 55th floor so be aware of that if you are booked in a room that offers the club privileges. I feel the move has lessened the experience and the…,5
"Positives:  Relatively large rooms and great views on both sides of hotel. Negatives:  Check-in slow with longer lines than in airport security checks, you even have to stand in line (14 minutes) for breakfast, service attitude indifferent, the hotel does not accept some major credit cards (Diners), the rooftop restaurant was closed for a private function, the upper deck pool was overcrowded and no deck chairs available ... in our view not worth the high price of the room cost.",1
"Stayed over the weekend for a family staycation.  It was smooth sailing from the moment we stepped into the lobby. We were appointed a butler, Sam escorted us to the room.  The sands suite was luxurious! 150 sqm with separated bedroom, 6 seater dinning, living and bathrooms. The floor to ceiling view perfected the mood. Espresso machine with wide election of teas were offered.  What surprises me was that the suite house a sizeable soundproofed media room! Great for a movie night with quality sound system.  The room also double as an extra room for my kids.  The club lounge offers great afternoon tea with fantastic view. We fondly enjoyed our breakfast and lunch at Sky57. The food were beyond our expectation.  Thank you Sam for arranging a birthday cake for my wife. It was a nice…",5
"It is incredible, the structure the services, casino, shopping centre, and a tube station several restaurants with fantastic food and chefs. The rooms, spacious and acceptable decoration. The swimming pool incredible! It is a different experience on a hotel. It is Marina Bay! ",5
"Stay at tower 1 level 45, facing the city view. lucky the haze was gone and was able to see the amazing singapore night view. enjoyed the time while staying at the hotel, free wifi. hotel in room service was good. swimming pool was crowded though as usual.  MRT and shopping centre is just down below.",5
"Beautiful hotel to spoil yourself. The pool is everything I had heard. Unfortunately the smoke fron the Indonesian fires was annoying but didn't detract completely from the view. Views at night from the sky deck and pool are simply exquisite. You just don't need to leave the complex. Shopping, food and relaxation is all provided. Staff were extremely helpful and organised tours and even advised where I could get a better exchange rate. Our room was large and the bed was very comfortable. I especially liked that the linen was not changed every day unless requested. They were serviced every day however. I would stay there again in a heart beat.",5
"The hotel without any doubt is luxury as soon as you step in and so is the whole complex. The view on the upper deck pool is amazing and breath taking views of Singapore   Yes the place is over crowded all the time as it is a place for tourists, casino, exhibitions, etc.... And hence the high price  The rooms are standard nothing wow compared to the price but the view and facilities are great if you are there for a relaxed trip in Singapore . Certainly not for business as you won't have the time to use all of them.  The staff are very helpful and will assist you all the time.  The free internet in the hotel is vey slow and can be almost dead sometimes which means you have to pay.  Great place and with the money",4
The room was amazing with a panoramic view . The infinity pool was spectacular with views across the city and a unique experience .  The club facilities and staff were fantastic and overall Marina Bay Sands was brilliant  throughout our  week long stay Highly recommend this Hotel,5
Room: Quite large with amazing view  Location: easily accessible   Amenities: Lavish  The best thing about this hotel is the Rooftop Pool which was pretty crowded in the evening. Though the best time is to enjoy the pool in morning with scenic views.,5
"Love this place. Such a groovy building. Terrific service, great views, adjacent to one of the best shopping centres in the world. Kid friendly, buffet breakfast best I've ever had. But the pool. Oh the pool. Now that's a pool. 150m infinity edge pool on L57, looking over the city. Magnifique.  Faultless.",5
"Booked the Premier Room  with garden view for One night on the 12/11/2015. It was a surprise for my husband's birthday. The staff expedite the check-in by directing us to the VIP check-in lounge. There we were served by a staff named, Ms Asuna, whom gave us the keys to our 44th Floor!   Filled with excitment we went to view the room. It was clean and spacious. The bathroom came with a bathtub and seperate shower as well. The bathroom has marble floorings and looked classy. Not forgetting the view from the balcony was stunning! It was quiet as well, we could only hear the horns of the ships from the nearby sea.   The room came with cable TV channels, so I assure you will not be bored. The room also has free wi-fi.   We headed to the infinity pool at the 57th floor. Though there…",5
"This is a typical casino hotel. If  you want a luxury classy experience stay away from it. Its is a mass processing plant of (mostly chinese) gamblers and their families. Everything is massively overpriced; e.g. the breakfast is $50 pp. The service is mechanical with no personal touch. The rooms are OK with the nice views at the higher floors. Showers are OK, but the bed is wobbly, so if you are a light sleeper your partner is guaranteed to wake you up a few  times. The cost of laundry of a suit, some shirts , etc was $350  The best feature of the hotel is the rooftop pool, but over the years this has changed from a more luxury exclusive area to loud screaming music with bars that easily extort you $100 for few beers.  I have asked my travel department to put this hotel on my…",3
"for the price paid , the suite was amazing! luxuriously overwhelming!  piano in the hall, spacious rooms,  bath tubs walk in wardrobe.  not forgetting inroom ktv and inroom massage corner and gym corner.",5
"I returned to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, staying at the club level room. Reservation and check in are both Super efficient despite the high volume of guests given the hotel size. Guest traffic was Organised and managed well to Ensure minimum wait.   The infinity pool was our number Favourite and always the key highlight of the stay. And even if there's nothing else worth returning for, this is the best reason enough.  The gym was well equipped, large and airy and has a very nice view out to the city. My friends who are gym experts also commended the facilities.  But I'm kinda disappointed with the club after relocation. The older location on the 57 th floor to me was nicer and more cosy with better views of the garden as well as the pool. But service wise was better than…",4
"I didn't get to stay here, but have been invited to hangout/party in their suites by friends on 2 occasions. The suites are awesome. Overly generous in size, has all that you can possibly ask for, and a great view. I don't know how much my friend had to pay for it, but I'll bet it costs a fortune",4
I am very happy to stay in Marina Bay sand from 9th Nov to 11th Nov 2015... very nice hotel..excellent staff ... perfect location ....perfect food....kids enjoy a lot....Infinity pool on 57th floor..amazing ....One of the best hotel in my life.... defiantly come again next year ....,5
"To be honest, the only reason why I booked this hotel during my birthday is to experience how exhilarating it is to be on top of MBS and enjoying the view while half of your body is dipped into the pool! Lol It was really awesome.",5
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel as a bit of a treat for our 1 year wedding anniversary. Upon checking in we advised it was for our wedding anniversary and we got an upgraded room which was absolutely fantastic - we loved every minute at this hotel, the pool was sensational and it was quite sad to ever have to leave. The reason I can only give them 3 stars is because after we checked out we noticed our invoice had numerous charges for the minibar! WE DID NOT USE THE MINIBAR!!!!!!! We moved some of the cans out of the way so we could cool some bottles of water and for some medication! We were totally unaware that the fridge has weight sensors in it and you are automatically charged for moving the items.  Had they have noticed that we put all the items back and not charged us,…",3
"Was passing through Singapore on our round the world backpacking trip and couldn't pass up on the opportunity to stay at this fantastic hotel and treat ourselves for one night. Queue for check in was a tad long but went down quite quick with a lot of people around trying to speed things up. We got to our room, changed and headed straight up to the pool to get ""the"" shot in the pool. To our disappointment the pool was closed due to bad weather but was later reopened. Pool can get crowded with everyone wanting photos but is still pretty impressive. Room was spacious and had all the luxuries you would expect from a hotel of its kind. Lots of restaurant choices although we was disappointed in our choice of Bread Street Kitchen. Would love to return here, hopefully for more than one…",5
"We stayed for the first time at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for 2 nights prior to a stay with friends. After shopping around online, the best deal is to book directly through the hotel's website! They'll match anything but it was the best price anyway! We chose to add an option of the club membership. We have a 2 year old and a 4 year old and arriving around midnight we were warmly welcomed and a quick check in and they had everything in place. This maybe due to a very thorough pre-arrival email and confirmation sheet they requested? The hotel room we had was a 1 bedroom corner room on the 49th floor (the highest residential level). It was huge and beautiful. In reality given the size of the rooms we probably only needed a regular room? A fold out sofa was great for one child…",5
Was told if we wanted to go to the top of this building to take a lift to the 57th floor and go to one of the bars for a drink. This is what we did and had a pleasant time sipping on a cocktail (not cheap but worth it for the experience) and admiring the view. Also was able to see the infinity pool although access is only for hotel guests,4
"This is a great hotel, stunning to look at, excellent service and great rooms and facilities. The rooftop pool is amazing and great views all round. Highly recommend and really convenient for the convention centre",4
"Apart from its iconic infinity pool, even the basic rooms were equipped with all the luxury amenities. They gave us a room on the 37th floor overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. The view was stunning from there and from atop too. The breakfast spread was huge, offering varied options. Unfortunately, the cheese and chocolate buffet offered in the restaurants there needed prior reservation so wasn't able to try that. This is worth a stay atleast once.",5
"Stayed here for one night.  Let's start from the positive points: - View from the rooms and the pool (though the windows are a bit dirty) - Great if you are going for a performance or conference in MBS and of course you are visiting the casino  Negative points: - Amenities like shower gel, shampoo etc looks and feel cheap - Location not convenient if you are visiting places other than MBS, long queue for taxi after show and long walk from MRT - No turn down service for a 5 star hotel - Arrived at 2:15 pm and was told no rooms available. Went back at 3 pm, despite being the earliest check in time, no king size bed available - Many drink items in menu not available from the bar on 57th floor - Earlier than normal check out time at 11 am  Overall it feels more like a 4 star than 5…",3
"A really great hotel, with the best infinity pool I have ever seen anywhere in the world. Rooms are good, with good network connectivity. Room service varied and reasonably priced. Location is great, transport is easy (whether walking, taxi or the MRT, of which there is a connected station). Downsides? Well, I am quibbling here: on-premise restaurants are expensive (although you're better off exploring Singapore for food anyway), and there is no lounge / seating (I had a number of hours to kill between checkout and heading to the airport, and there was nowhere I could sit down and work).",4
"Our stay was super good. The receptionists and other staff were friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was fine - I like it. Room was fine too, spacious and clean - we got a deluxe room city view. I requested for a cake because it was my partner's birthday back then, and they delivered one. Everything went well during our stay! A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. Thumbs up!",5

This is my first time staying at MBS since I usually stayed at IHG(Platinum Elite) or Accor (gold) chain hotel but since during those period the room was not available. So I thought I gave MBS a try and see what the fuss about. I mostly travel to Singapore on business at least spend 15 nights a month.  Stayed at room 4681 from 04th Nov - 07th Nove 2015. Check in was very pleasant with so much information given by the Front Office which is a vey nice touch.   Everything was perfect until I turn on the TV the night before my checkout date. I checked on the billing status and to my surprise there's a charge for restaurant bill that I did not take which is Sky on 57. Immediately I phone the front office regarding this matter and i was told the FO manager has been notified and I can…,2
"i dont know if we were just lucky, but our experience at Marina Bay Sands, is so much different to so many reviews I read on here.  We loved every bit, we had a garden view room on the 30th floor in Tower 3.and the view was amazing, the room was spacious and perfect,the bathroom very luxurious  We even had a little balcony we were checked in early, bags bought up swiftly and an hour after check in , a lady came to the door, to make sure we were okay and if we needed anything.  The bed was super comfortable, and housekeeping perfect,  We had no problems getting a bed at the pool, even though we were there on the weekend, we went to the both during the day and at night, plenty of beds and plenty of space.  the pool is actually a bit overwhelming, it is so breathtaking,  We ate at…",5
"Wow, what a hotel. 57 floors across three blocks. The size is unbelievable.  When we first checked in, we had paid for the cheapest room, which at £225 wasn't exactly cheap. We were allocated a garden view room on the third floor. We were very disappointed about being so low so I asked to be higher and said I didn't mind paying slightly more. We were offered a city view room on the 53rd floor for an extra 53 singapore dollars (£25) and I didn't hesitate. You are already paying so much that extra bit gets you so much more.  Onto the room. Huge. Spacious. Clean. And the view... Wow! I've attached pictures as words can do no justice.  The main reason we wanted to stay here like a lot of others is because of the world's largest rooftop pool on the 57th floor. It was incredible. We…",5
I went with friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. We got a room with a really nice view (room 1011). This room is not city view but it looks to other side which is Gardens by the Bay. Room was big enough for us and we could ask for an extra bed for a child which was basically as big as the other twin beds we had. Bathroom also very nice and spacious but has no bathtub. This was in a basic room (can't remember room name). We were just there for a day so we didn't really want to splurge beyond that room (originally around SGD400plus). Luckily a friend's mother has a membership and we got a better deal.   Service was okay. We asked for a birthday cake to surprise my friend but it took ages to come. But anyway it was a sizeable cake and it was delicious.   The hotel has easy…,3
We stayed here for 3 nights in a premium room with the breakfast package.   We were on the 47th floor with views of the Marina. Rooms are generously sized and sice we were celebrating a birthday we were given a slice of cake with a candle after our room was serviced.  Whilst rooms are serviced daily...turndown service is only given uppn request. I found this quite unusual for a 5 star hotel.  Firstly the check in process surprisingly was really smooth and I was quite impressed. We had a VIP check in so we were taken straight from our cab to the room.   Thats where the impressive service stopped. This hotel is like a train station. Do not go here if you are after a relaxing holiday. You step out to a packed lobby with long ques at check in. The breakfast at sky on 57 is very…,3
"I've got no idea why this place would get negative reviews. Hotel is outstanding in every aspect. Huge well appointed rooms, amazing facilities, restaurant and pool and very friendly staff. Yes it is expensive but the whole experience is worth it. Only negative was the smog surrounding Singapore affected the view from the infinity pool.",5
"Gigantic hotels and resorts tend to be somewhat soulless and fails to make a guest special. Not MBS, though. From check in to how friendly and helpful the staff are. We were there for a week that just flew by Amenities are excellent. Accessible as it has a subway station and the shopping arcade is amazing. Restaurants are fantastic and nightlife quite vibrant We loved it so much we decided that our first trip abroad with our newborn son will be to MBS in February It's a unique destination in an amazing country  P.S. For a little more book a grand club room with city view. Out of this world",5
"We stayed here for 2 nights on our way from London to Australia.  What a great hotel - restaurants, shops etc at your doorstep! We had a grand club room - massive, stunning views and great decor. Service was faultless, staff happy to help and nothing is too much trouble! Can't wait to return!",5
Hotel check-in took us around an hour which is unacceptable but since we were offered a good upgrade we took back our happy faces. We Booked an Orchid Suite overnight and was immediately mesmerised by the view. The suite was a vast space of luxury and comfort fit for a picky traveler. The infinity swimming pool however was a disappointment because it was too overcrowded with guests taking selfies. Lots of activities within the hotel premises but if you plan to go elsewhere. MBS is easily accessible thru taxi or MRT.,4
"business trip with my son   stayed in a grande club suite  large hotel but could not provide two single beds  room other than this was fantastic, check in was long winded  and not that helpful even with the prices they charge  staff at breakfast were fantastic  shame they dont promote some to front desk.   pool was the highlight.",4
"Obviously this is an amazing hotel with world class facilities. But to be a world class hotel it is missing one vital ingredient. Guests will pay exorbitant tariffs if they are made to feel special. A quality hotel is where you are met with a welcome smile at the door, your cases whisked away to your room and you are escorted to your room with advice on how to use swipe cards and the features of th hotel. You are usually greeted with a treat, chocolates, fruit or wine and fresh milk for a cup of tea or coffee. None of this happens at the Sands. Instead you will easily be lost in a mass of guests and will need to find your own room. When you arrive you will discover you will need to pay for a fridge and high speed wifi. There is a small bar fridge full of overpriced drinks, a can…",3
"We were suggested to stay in this trendy hotel which has a nice view frm the 58th floor. Surprisingly when we were checking in, we were upgraded from Deluxe room which i booked for  nights, to Sands Suit on the 19th floor (Tower 1) with 145 sq.m. and a pool table inside. It was huge! We had a garden view. The room was nice and clean, though it was really huge. Thanks to coffee maker, i enjoyed a coffee every morning. They had a nice choice of bath accessories. However, breakfast in not included-(. Come on, guys! For that price - breakfast in not inlcuded? One time stay. Wouldnt choose it again.",4
I booked a superior room (city view) approx paid $450 inclusive of tax in usd per night. stayed for 4 nights.  -rooms are nice and big (but having able to try different hotels in singapore in my past visits its practically a standard sized room for singapore hotels.)  -no bathtubs for superior rooms (seeing how the bathroom looks makes me consider rooms overpriced)  -breakfast is good .. but make sure to come early as you will have to fall in line since its a huge hotel expect to cue longer (note:i paid extra for the bfast since its not included at my rate yet.)  -love the beds beddings and the comforters.  -beware of the mini bar and fridge since it has a computerized detector that will charge you automatically if u move anything in it.  -swimming pool at the top has a nice…,3

"The Marina Bay Sands was a must when visiting Singapore and I don't regret it. We booked 3 nights for our honeymoon and it was our finale and much more than what we expected. Just some tips for people going to book. we booked a deluxe city view. It was lovely to wake up to in the morning, however I would have been happy to wake up on the other side also with a view of the Gardens by Bay as it tends to be misty some times. Also as you know the infinity pool is the highlight and to get the true experience and enjoy it practically to your self I highly recommend going up at 6.30am -definitely worth the early wake up call . Its too overcrowded any other time of the day. Breakfast of $43 was overpriced and you can grab a lovely breakfast in other places for half the amount. We took…",5
"We've been going to Singapore many times over the last few years. My husband's family celebrated my father-in-law's birthday by staying at MBS. It was a very pleasant experience. The only downside to the place is that there's always a LOT of people, but if you don't mind that, then great! If you're looking for less crowded accommodation, then this might not be for you. I like that it's near the ArtScience Museum, which always has great exhibits. All in all, great view, good food, excellent service.",4
"The best hotel ever to stay even though it is very very expensive.  Superb Infinity Pool, friendly staff.   Superb GYM with all facilities.  Perfect location and the view. Once in your lifetime everyone must stay there",5
"What can be said about the pool except WOW! This is an incredible view and an amazing concept of an infinity pool that overlooks the city. I was a little sceptical about the price for a casino. How wrong I was. I cannot stress enough, the pool is truly worth the price- even if it is just for a night or so.   The room is spacious and distinctly ""asian"" in appearance. Plenty of marble and gold but very comfortable and clean. There is a big balcony on most rooms which strangely do not have any outdoor furniture on it. We had a great view of the gardens which at night were spectacular. The hotel has amazing facilities including a great gym and fitness centre, plenty of amazing restaurants and one of the most efficient check out processes I have ever witnessed. This hotel, despite…",5
"Nice hotel. Rooms are spacious. The only downside is the number of mainland chinese tourist at the pool area n everywhere else. They are loud, they like to squeeze and don't understand personal space.   Food is not bad. There are many restaurants available. First floor, there is Jin Shan n Rise(buffet) or you can walk towards the shopping area where there are nice celebrity restaurants or even a food court ",3
"I took my family here to celebrate my birthday and it was a bad choice!!! It's sooooo busy, crowded, unorganized and overpriced!!! The only good part was the hotel is connected to the mall so that's handy.  I guess if you were a gambler, you might like it.  ",2
"This hotel is an icon in the Singapore skyline and with its spectacular infinity swimming pool it is a one-off must do.  It is a very large hotel in all senses, and that is the main reason it only gets a 4 from us. It is too large to give you the intimate feeling of a staff knowing you and your needs.  Everything works just fine everywhere in the hotel but you can't stop feeling that you are only a visitor, and only one out of a thousand.  The room, a deluxe room with city view, was spacious and had a decent sized bathroom. The view was also ok, being at 21 floor you had an ok city view but lower floors would struggle to have unobstructed view.  Ce La Vie bar on top floor has a fantastic view, it's crowded most of the time but you will get your chances of taking pictures every…",4
"I stayed at 8th floor of Tower 3 with Gardens by The Bay view last week.  We checked in from Tower 1 counter. The check in area was not impressive and did not reflect luxury as many other 5 star hotel did. There were people dressing down, dressing us, or even with wet bathing suits around.. And no welcome drink or even no staffs offering help for our luggage. I think the bigger hotel, the less service, it was not because they were poor manner, but mostly because out of hands with so many in/out guests. The check in was simple though, since we made bed & breakfast booking thru their website.  The highlight of this hotel, to be honest, was the infinity pool. It was so packed with people in the afternoon, but a bit less in the morning.  The room itself was standard, I would not say…",4
Great hotel and service. All is very nice looking very good room. Slept in tower 3 view to the marina bay -not the sea. Great view from 40 flour. But....Shops and restaurant very expensive :(. All them If meals are not included go out eat well and cheaper by high. ,5
"When you're in Singapore, you must stay in Marina Bay Sands. The pool is simply amazing. Wow! Also the room was so big with great bed and big and nice bathroom. This was the best hotel experience in my life. ",5
"While I cannot fault the hotel - Great rooms/bathrooms, very attentive staff and an amazing view from the sky deck/pool, I felt this hotel lacked any soul. It was simply one massive three tower monster with hundreds and hundreds of  people everywhere you looked. Swimming pool was completely overcrowded. breakfast buffet was good but again exceptionally busy as the restaurant would have easily seated 300-400 people. Most mornings had to queue for up to fifteen minutes to be seated. The large scale of the hotel prevents it from feeling luxurious which is would you would expect here given the price of the rooms. If you are looking for something a little classy, intimate, luxurious and value for money this is not the place for you.",3
"Having stayed for one night only after a cruise, I made sure to take full advantage of the hotel, the inifinity pool and the exclusive lounge on the top floor (for an additional fee) where I was treated like a VIP.  The hotel is something out of Star Trek and so much going on from a quiet coffee in the lobby to the beats on the roof garden.  Amazing night views not to be missed!",4
This hotel is perfect if you like to gamble and needless to say for the stunning sky deck and pool. However the lobby feels like a market at times due to it being overcrowded and the rooms are average. It feels like one of those mass convention hotels. Does not feel cosy or luxurious. ,4
"I stayed at this hotel with friends during the Grand Prix weekend. Immediate first impressions where that the hotel was luxury with high standards and helpful staff. The rooms where clean, spacious and had lovely views. Staff where always willing to help when their services where required. Only downside to this hotel is that it is very expensive and during Grand Prix weekend you have to stay for a minimum of 3 nights. The infinity pool on the roof was amazing with some jaw dropping views. ",4
Visited Singapore in Feb  so this review has been long due . Stayed there for 3 Nights with room being on 54th Floor over looking the botanical gardens.Room was very spacious and had serious amount of tech built into the rooms to control all operations which I loved . Now coming to best feature property had to offer INFINITY POOL on 96th Floor Covering all the 3 Towers The view of Singapore city below was spectacular .We stayed in the pool till it was lil dark to see all the lights of Skyscrapers.Great food and one of the Lagrest shopping Malls that I have seen .,5

All my complaints : - no proper automobile approaches for all three towers    Tower 3 has a very haphazard approach, cars were honking while we were trying to       get our bags    none for Tower 2  - no one to greet you, nor any porter to help with luggage at Tower 3 !!  - not enough concierge for the spread out floor plan of the hotel  - the computer system was down !    OMG, the hotel is less than 6 years old  - front desks at Tower 3 completely empty on the 21st morning     BIG time OMG !!! not even a proper person to direct, if not run the guests' needs to            the next Tower  - hotel lobby is like an outside public street     there were high school students running up and down the escalators into…",2
"In fact, I love it so much I didn't leave it.  Everything about it is fabulous.  Room, staff, ambience.  Perfect place to unwind and relax on your way to anywhere.  We chose to break our trip home from Europe to Australia with two nights at Marina Bay.  Pretty sure we've kicked the jet lag and what a place to do it.  The Club Rooms are great value with all the inclusions and just love a night time swim in that amazing pool.  We have been here before and I'm sure we will return again.  Pretty sure this is my favourite hotel in the world.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is enormous,grand and as busy as a small city.Hundreds of people in the foyer at all times.To walk the foyer of the 3 towers is like being in a large shopping mall.Nothing here is cheap from accommodation,drinks and food.We had an upgrade at an extra cost with magnificent city views.The rooms are spacious with floor to ceiling glass windows.The top pool floor is open early for a swim and to take in the amazing city views.We really enjoyed our few days here,check-in to service was fantastic.MRT is easy to navigate around town,very cheap and gets you to all the top tourist spots.",5
"我們在金沙住了一晚，大部份的時間都待在壯闊的空中泳池 來新加坡一定要造訪的景點，偉大的工程! 美中不足的是要避開每年10月，印尼的火耕季節讓新加坡天空佈滿霾....可惜 We stayed 1 night there, spent most of our time at the pool it is a MUST see place when you visit Singapore we went on this Oct, the only thing to complain was the bad weather the sky was covered by haze most of the time....sigh... other than that, it is really a nice hotel, amazing architecture including a convenient shopping center right beneath and quick access to the gardens by the bay. ",5
"this has definitely been my high light of my trip to asia.  This hotel was more than i expected.  We stayed in tower 2 on 34th floor overseeing the city view.  Wow is all i can say.  Fantastic room, the infinity pool and skypark was a site to remember.  I ended up staying in the entire time instead of exploring the city while i was here.   Worth every penny.  To save on high speed wifi you can opt in and sign up for a rewards card which they later waive the $20 fee.",5
"This is the most costliest place in Singapore and is consider to be a Las Vegas of Singapore.  However, for tourist, it's a photo op location. One should not miss the free fountain show which is remarkable in evenings. The brand stores are amazing. I would say it's a different world in Singapore. ",4
"I was lucky enough to enjoy the hospitality of some friends who were staying at the hotel.  I am not sure what the room cost, but, I know it wasn't inexpensive. On arrival at Tower 1, I did walk up to the front doors and expected them to be automatically.  Once I realised that they weren't going to open by themselves, I reached out 'pulled'... and hoped no-one was watching... hee hee. The concierge desk was very helpful and we used them again about 4 times after our arrival.  Thanks boys and girls, you helped make our stay very enjoyable. If you are staying, why not join their club?  It is free and you can get some great discounts... our bonus was a discount at the Theatre.  We thought perhaps 5 or 10%, but, believe me when I say it was heaps more than 30%.  Score! I had thought…",4
"I was very satisfied with my entire experience with Marina Bay Sands from my booking to my check out. After making my booking online through the hotel website, I was contacted by Jasmine Sin and Jeraldine to coordinate the details in preparation for my arrival at the hotel. This greatly put my mind at ease and made my check-in process a complete breeze.   I was warmly welcomed to the hotel and walked to the concierge desk by Jeremy Cheah, then greeted cheerfully by Cheryl at check-in. To my surprise, she informed me on behalf of the Premium Services team that I would be upgraded as I was celebrating my birthday at the hotel. I was extremely delighted by this point and if that wasn't enough, the team had also arranged for a birthday cake and a complimentary bottle of champagne to…",5
"Wow really says it all - what an experience this hotel was! Myself and my boyfriend had been travelling for 3 months backpacking round south east Asia and this was a massive treat for us. We mucked up our reservation by a night and when we tried to change it unfortunately they didn't have a room of the same standard for the night before so we paid a bit more to upgrade and now I can see why it was an upgrade!!! We were in tower 3, garden view in the biggest hotel room I have ever been in in my life. When we checked in from the start every single member of staff was so friendly and helpful, due to our room we got a free afternoon tea, free canopies and drinks for 2 hours that night and a free breakfast the next day. The food was unbelievable and worth the upgrade 100%. The pool…",5
Best hotel on singapore i really enjoy there and best swimming pool have execlent view. The staff was frindly and helpful . The food is international so you can eat a lote of thing .

"The Orchid Suite is nice.  Perhaps a bit of overkill in size, but having views over both sides of the building is one of its greatest features.  The sleeping area is huge.  The beds are firm, the Nespresso machine is a nice inclusion.  Views are stunning, both by day and night.  The standard of cleanliness maintained in our suite, cleaned by the excellent Zhen Long was second to nothing I have experienced before.  The added Club Experience is a brilliant feature well worth the inclusion in the room price.  The Club is an excellent venue for enjoyment, with free flowing Piper Heidsieck from 5pm to 7pm, or whatever else is your drink of choice, within reason.  The hotel is large and crowded.  The lobby especially and we tended to avoid it where possible.  The pool is very well…",5
"were immediately upgraded, check in was quite smooth, the room was very spacious with wonderful city view. Nicely located with casino and shopping center under it. Went to the pool and sky park, great experience but honestly extremely  crowded up there in the pool and at the skypark. Recommended to stay here, especially if one like the casino, as no need to get in the long taxi que afterwards, just walk back to the room :)",5
"Just visiting the Marina Bay Sands. It's very upmarket, with designer rooms, designer malls & designer attention to detail. It's USP is its magnificent rooftop pool area with stunning infinity pool overlooking the harbour of Singapore. I've only seen one better, the Hotel Caruso in the Amalfi Coast.  The suites are very plush, with the most comfortable beds - we managed a full 12 hour sleep after our partying excesses in Singapore, which has now crept into our top 5 cities to visit, along with New York, Istanbul, Barcelona & London.  Things to be aware of at the Marina Bay - breakfast is extortionate - cost us best part of £50 this morning when we thought it was included in the price of our stay, which is extremely expensive anyway. Also the rooftop cocktail bar, whilst having…",4
"This place is not only a landmark, but a beautiful one. We didn't actually stay here, but made a point to visit it anyway. We visited the 57th floor and got to experience the breathtaking views of Singapore. The Hotel itself s stunning and looks like an amazing place to stay.",5
Iconic.  Typically impeccable Singaporean service... spa - one of the best massages I've ever had... casino - no where like it Ive ever been... sic-bo heaven.... shopping... better than any mall I've seen in the US... rooftop - everything but especially a day at the famous infinity pool... just watching people take endless selfies is worth it... gym - horridly hot... 85 degrees... but loved every minute of it.,5
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 4 days and 3 nights as a staycation for my mom's 40th Birthday. We booked an Orchard Suite for the 1st night as my mom decided to invite her friends and have a small get together. IT WAS AMAZING! There was enough room for everybody, a large dining table to eat together, and a pool table to just have fun! It was also great that there's a separate wash room for the guests as I almost stayed in the bath while my mom host her party. 😂  We then transferred to a Deluxe room which has an amazing view of the city lights! Our suite has a view of Gardens by the Bay, which then was only starting to set up a light deco. It was beautiful.   The room service and housekeeping is excellent. We even had a personal butler on our first night. They respond very…",5
"I travel to Singapore frequently on business. I usually stay at the Intercontinental Hotel (Bugis) or Fullerton Bay Hotels and have also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Raffles, and Regent.  Compared to other hotels, the Marina Bay is more of an integrated resort than a luxury hotel.  Because of its size, all of the procedures, systems, service, etc... is very standardized but at a very high level.  The food quality, for example, is top notch, but you wouldn't be expected to be greeted by name at the entrance.  For business travelers, it's a great in-and-out hotel that guarantees that you will be having the same 5 star quality level each time and the rooms and facilities are all very well kept. I haven't had any complaints about any of the services…",5
"I had a great stay as iconic as the property itself. This property has 2500+ rooms and so please expect the lobby to be busy and crowded. I had the fastest check-in and check-out in my life here! They have great staff, very friendly and very swift, all very well experienced. The guys at the concierge were very helpful. My room was upgraded and I got an early check-in. There is metro station nearby and so easy access to all major parts of the city. Gardens by the bay is just opposite to the hotel. I enjoyed the breakfast very much due to South Indian dishes. I went to the sky deck and pool, it was so busy, the wagyu burgers were very tasty. The weather wasn't great due to haze. Rooms were cleaned everyday and I had to inform my room attendant to take-it-easy! I would highly…",5
"Very nice staff who are efficient and service minded. A very big hotell, our room was very ordinary, but with a fantastic view over the city. Crowded in the lobby, crowded in the lifts, crowded at the rooftop pool. A bit to crowded for us. Will book a more quiet hotel next time.",3
"It became one of my favorite hotel, unforgettable experience and memories. I stayed premier room with bath tub.  Very spacious bathroom and luxourious.  Would choose this hotel for my next singapore. Would miss the view from the infinity pool , top of the building.  ",5
Spent only one night as a bit over my budget. Still I wanted to try it and the money was well worth it. Huge in every sense. View was great in the bay. One of the best view money can buy. Room was also very nice. ,5
We've been there twice. I love their infinity pool and jacuzzi. Its very fun staying here with the family. Love the place. The morning view is a breath-taking moment. You'll appreciate the whole marina area when u're on the top. ,5
The best hotel in which I have  stayed till now the greatest thing which I like is there big spacious swimming pool the best in the world and big rooms staff was very polite and  helpful with recommend  this hotel to stay,5
"We booked the rooms a half year before we went there so they weren't that expensive. Nevertheless we got great rooms on a high level and a nice view. Of course we visited the infinity pool on the top which was the second best pool I've ever seen (first is Bondi in Sidney ;-) ). The food and drinks on the roof are a bit too expensive in my opinion but good. Overall i can highly recommend the Marina Bay Sands, it's a once in a lifetime experience",5
"I went with my mum and sister for one night to experience to pool. As they didn't have twin beds anymore we got an upgrade as an excuse, which totally made up for it. Somehow they didn't register my payment which was a bit of trouble as we had to figure that out. Anyway the upgrade made more than up for it. Overall the staff is very nice and the sms check in is very convenient. And of course the pool is absolutely stunning, even there are quite a lot of people. It's a pricey but great experience.  The only thing is that the restrict the wifi, which is a bit ridiculous for such a price.",5
"We loved our stay at Marina Bay Sands.  We were in one of the club rooms.  We used the club for breakfast which was good.  The main reason we stayed here was for the pool view.  It was just as nice as expected and we spent time lounging around the pool to eat.  The pool was pretty busy most times and everyone was taking photos.  The pool was fairy cold though so it was more take a picture then get out.  The hotel was near the gardens, ferris wheel, and duck tours.  We also walked around the bay.  In order to get to the night safari and Sonesta we had to take a cab.  I also picked the hotel due to the casino.  It was nice and offered a variety of games.  I didnt spend much time there though as I had better luck at the Resorts World.  There is an entrance to the casino near the…",5
"Stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon. Our flight arrived early and unfortunately we were not able to check in to our room until 3pm, which was very disappointing after a long flight. They did offer us cards to access the showers and pool although as we had limited time during our stopover we were hoping to be able to check in to our room.  If you are looking for boutique, personalized service then this is not the hotel for you as you do feel as though you are just another guest. The hotel is very large and takes quiet some time to get from check-in counter to the elevators to room, so not recommended for guests with mobility issues. Location is great as a short trip down the escalators in the main lobby is a shopping complex which then leads out to the bay and…",5

"We had a layover in Singapore on one of our flights during our honeymoon that we were spending across Asia, so we decided to try this hotel and we were surprised from the begining with the free room upgrade that we received because of our honeymoon, we got garden views and few details in the room, like chocolates, strawberries, coffee.. etc.. The staff during the check-in /out was very fast, helpful and efficient. The pool is amazing, you can find some trash on it (leaves of trees), nothing important, but it's a detail ;) Surely we'll comeback soon.",5
"I stayed here for 2 nights, with my wife on my visit to Singapore this August. The hotel no doubt is too classy and made beautifully with an amazing infrastructure, and real helpful staff, but the downside is, that its too over crowded.  The hotel is known for its infinity pool on the top floor. Most of the people who stay here, just do so to experience the infinity pool, but the truth is, its a waste even trying to get in, because most of the time its FULL of people. Forget swimming, you cant even enjoy the view from the top properly. Overall its a good property though.",4
"Amazing 2-night staycation over my boyfriend's birthday weekend. Great assistance rendered by the staff at MBS, from pre-arrival, to check-in and during the stay. Special mentions to Nur Izzati for helping with the arrangements to receive a cupcake surprise delivery for my boyfriend; Vance, the staff who served us at check-in who offered a complimentary upgrade to premier room as part of their efforts to make us feel welcomed and loved, and he took quite abit of time during check-in to find a room with superb view, just for us; Xi Na, the service staff for housekeeping for meticulously helping us to re-arrange the messy items we left on dressing table and in the bathroom. On the first night of the check-in, we were also surprised with a slice of complimentary chocolate mousse…",5
"I booked this hotel to round off our Singapore vacation and make use of the fantastic pool. It was not cheap, but worth every cent. The hotel was enormous, the biggest place I have stayed, but so efficient so felt quite at home. We arrived around mid-day. The huge lobby was packed, and anywhere else, could have been overwhelming. The queue at reception was not too long, but as soon as we joined, we were asked for our details. I produced the booking confirmation, the gentleman checked and then escorted us to another desk where we were seen straight away. Although we were a couple of hours early, one of our two rooms was ready so we were able to leave all our cases there and got temporary pool cards.  We were shown to our room by Madurai who was most helpful and showed us where…",5
"Unbelievable hotel, an amazing view of the bay and its financial district, across a really nice park next to the river. Complex with mall and convention center. Pool at the top of the hotel is a priceless experience. Good quality of services and food. It worth due to the location.",4
"We stayed at the room facing gardens by the bay and the view was fantastic. Although the swimming pool was full of people taking the pictures, but we still enjoyed the atmosphere very much. The food with room service was also delicious, we ordered one pizza with sausage. The only suggestion we would make is that it was a little bit difficult to find front desk if you arrive by the MRT because the area was too big. All in all, everything was good and above satisfactory.",5
"Only stayed one night but absolutely amazing! Let us check in early and go to our room meaning we got the most out of our 1 night stay as we could access the amazing infinity pool! Bathroom was huge, lots of towels, robes and slippers! Amazing view of the city with a sofa area to relax! The service was excellent at the pool, free clean towels, table service and helpful friendly staff! Highly recommend! View from the pool is incredible! ",5
"Spent one night at MBS... Wouldn't do it again and I don't recommend it. Paid almost 700 SGD, for a double room, no breakfast. Compare rooms, amenities, but especially service and staff to any other five star hotel in town and you'll pay half the price for a true luxury hotel experience. ",2
"We wanted to visit and enjoy this amazing hotel, i felt it was like a market crowd at the entrance checkin counters could have  been done in a different way .staff were very helpful  we had a nice time just having a quick view   For. Tourist a best place ",5
"I have stayed many hotels across the globe and ofc Singapore. So far this is the top. Check in was swift, you cannot expect to receive personal touch like other smaller hotel but receptionist went above and beyond. Rooms were sadly...normal, i stayed 2 different rooms none had balcony (there might be different room category which i did not have chance to stay). Its spacious, great amenities, huge bathroom but bedroom is a bit boring. Pool on top is exquisite, you can spend whole day up there after busy day. This will be a top choice for me, highly recommend",5
The Infiniti Pool at the rooftop is amazing. You get a bird's eye view of Singapore. Have a beer at the poolside cafe and they serve awesome Turkish sandwiches. The pool gets  a bit crowded with guests in the evening.,5
"Stayed this hotel while on business in Singapore and i must say the facilities and the management was wonderful. I loved the attention to detail and taste they had in the food. I did not have the chance to experience the infinity pool but had the chance to see the pool with its spectacular view. Sometimes i wondered if all the humans in the world is here, its very busy but i can see the management well handling everything.",5
My stay here was September 2014.   It was amazing! The views were spectacular and I spent every afternoon at the infinity pool. I would say it's one of the best infinity pool I've been to. Very relaxing with views across the city.   Highly recommend it. ,5
"I was to be attending a conference at MBS so it made sense to stay close to the conference. The conference facilities across the road were excellent. So are the shops. The casino is OK, nothing brilliant, just a casino.  But the hotel itself? The rooms are OK. The food at the main Chinese lobby restaurant was also quite OK. In this respect, MBS is a very good hotel.  But the lobby and main area resemble a railway station, with people running everywhere, pushing trolleys or suitcases, long queues etc and staff that on more than one occasion were not helpful. It really detracts from the MBS experience.",3
"Family stay in this giant hotel. It's actually too large. Very unpersonal, long ques and long waiting for check in. The room was pretty big with nice view of the marina. A bit dark interior. Nothing special. We really enjoyed the rooftop pool. They even have a photo service at the top. ",3
"We came for a 3-day work conference in September and the first thing that strikes you is the sheer scale of the place, our conference had 1,500+ delegates and just one of about 4 or 5 similar size conferences taking place at the same time, yet service was fast, polite and efficient and we never once during our stay felt the place was crowded or that we had to wait for anything. Cocktails on the roof terrace on the first night gave a quick crash-course in ignoring you're 57 floors up and just enjoying yourself whilst being careful not to drop your phone, handbag or shoes lest they bounce off the floor, under the bannister and into the air (not a hotel for people suffering from vertigo!). The infinity pool is just as amazing and out of this world as it looks on the website. Not…",4
"I’ve never been one for staycations, but I finally capitulated, seeing how SG50 (Singapore’s 50th National Day) would only come once in a lifetime. So lucky me managed to snag a last minute booking in a Club Room of Singapore’s most iconic hotel. Yes, what better way to watch what was billed to be Singapore’s best National Day fireworks yet. All from the comfort of a personal room with a front row view of the explosions.  Celebrations aside, I’ve had the pleasure of staying in a fair few other club rooms around the world, and the honest truth is that the experience (or lack of) is quite underwhelming at the Sands. Perhaps, this is simply the quality one gets at a casino hotel. I won’t bore you with the specifications of the room (room 4051, if you must know, and you can find…",3

I just wanted to snap pictures all the time. the interior design, the elements everywhere are just amazing. I did manage to talk to the stuff and they are all extremely friendly and helpful. Staying in the hotel without visiting the Skypark is like having a dinner without the dessert. Magnificent view of the city from all direction, must see at day time and night time. Yes, the bar drinks are expensive but what do you expect from 5 stars hotel, the drinks are delicacies.

"Had a fantastic one day stay at Marina Bay, booked a club room and got an upgrade to a suite which has fantastic view on 53rd floor.  Included is afternoon tea and evening drinks and food in the club as part of the package, along with access to all the facilities and the wonderful skypark and rooftop pool.  Only issues are for such a large size the service can be a little slow, reception checking in and out took quite a while and after booking the hotel limo service the driver didn't know the car features or functions (other than driving it) and didn't know the area very well which caused us to request a refund on the lost time.  Overall i'd certainly stay again for a special occasion but plan my trip a little more to make use of every single facility to get full value for money.",4
"We booked this hotel as a few of our friends had been for drinks in the sky bar and sung its praises. We thought that we would treat ourselves for the last night of our holiday and booked a standard city view room.   On check in we were greeted by a lovely gentleman who took our bags and then the lady on check it was very smiley and welcoming. Upon checking in we were asked if we were on our honeymoon (unfortunately not and we were laughing about her rubbing salt in the wound). A gentleman called Vance came over and offered us an upgrade to a suite and of course we accepted it with open arms.   When we entered our suite(!!) I was just gob-smacked, it was amazing - it had a pool table, in the room, a pool table! It was so amazing. We had a gorgeous view of the Gardens by the Bay…",5
"From the minute we got there, all the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Waited to check in for about 2 minutes and we were lucky and scored a free suite upgrade. The room was easily the best I've ever stayed in and the view of the Gardens by the Bay was amazing. The Infinity Pool didn't disappoint, a great view (obviously) and the service was even better. You can also check out in your room if you're paying with your credit card so you can skip the line.   I would definitely stay here again.",5
"Check in process was smooth and efficient, the staff member did find us a double bedded room on a very high floor, kudos to the staff but I unfortunately couldn't remember his name. Room was spacious, big and clean bathroom with large bath tub, and oh the stunning views of Marina Bay and the city skyline!!!. Definitely worth the visit. Guests also are granted free entry to gardens by the bay and also the infinity pool and also the observatory deck. High recommended.",4
"It is a beautiful hotel, perfect pool, a symbol known in the entire world. Nothing to complain about this.The only thing that probably is not on everybody taste is that it is a very touristy hotel. Everything is aimed at make you spend and doesn't have the soul of a place that can make you fall in love with it.",4
"we were just having a long lay-over from yangon on our way back to manila and decided to while the time away by visiting this place. it was huge. had we been given a longer time, we would opt to discover more places and shop for more items. all restaurants were full so we opted to dine at the food court w/c was buzzing by hungry tourists. will definitely go back & explore longer next time.",5

During the past 2 days of our stay, we encountered most of the MBS staff being very friendly and they never fail to smile and greet. We want to thank these special staff who made our stay so memorable.   1) Premier service team- Cheryl welcome us with lots of enthusiasm and gave us a detailed tour of MBS. The rest of the team was also very friendly despite us asking so many questions.  2) The flower uncle- Roger was very sweet.

"Built by the same owners as the Las Vegas Venetian hotel, the commonalities are plentiful: large hotel with 2500+ rooms, attached casino and large shopping mall, ice rink, food court, theater, restaurants - it is a resort in itself. Connected directly to the Singapore Metro (station: Bayfield) and across from the beautiful Gardens at The Bay, you don't have to venture out very far to be entertained. The most stunning feature is the rooftop: as guest you have access to a stunning infinity pool on the 56th floor with great views, awesome pool service - and always crowded. The hotel is clearly a major destination for tour groups and convention goers, and seems to be always full and busy. Rooms are spacious, and of course the higher up the better the view.

"Iconic feature of the Singapore skyline, home to possibly the world's most beautiful view from a pool in a city. But the experience of staying there was underwhelming, and I felt very much like a number -- and the mission was to extract maximum value from me. My room was nothing special -- it felt like a 3-star room in a chain hotel that just happened to have a beautiful soaking tub. Carpet was grimy and stained, well overdue for a change. Both my water kettle and iron stopped working on me -- they delivered replacements, but it still cost me valuable minutes on already-rushed mornings. I was staying there for the sake of convenience because I was attending a conference at the Sands. But by the time you elevator down and wind your way through the casino and mall to the…",2
"This hotel, is a one off. Architectural the split into 3 towers with an amazing infinity pool spanning all towers in a kind of boat shape must be unique.   The hotel is excellent , rooms a very hight standard and the central bar/ meal area very nice - and frequently has classical musicians providing a nice ambience. I realise this is common in SG but it's still nice. This hotel is also opposite the largest and most famous high end shopping mall in SG. At the back of the mall is access to the lake, free evening shows with lasers etc mounted from the hotel shining over the lake. A the 3k Olympic walkway around the lake is a lovely trek with longer options available.   It's part hotel part cultural experience.",5
If you can afford to stay there you will love it but as a visitor you feel like an intruder and wonder if the aloof staff are trained to spot the aliens.  Have a wander but beware -drinks in bars are very expensive  -if you would like to enter the casino you need your passport (not just a photo),4
"This is my 2nd stay at MBS.  Stayed here from Oct 20-24, I was attending ITB Asia and due to its proximity to the convention site, it's for the convenience why I stayed here.  If it's a personal leisure travel, for the room rate my company paid -- would choose a boutique hotel and get a suite, and privacy perks.  The place is massive and the staff lacks that ""service from the heart"".  Reception staff works like robots.  The cue line for breakfast would take you 20-30 minutes before you get seated.  And when you are in a rush for your 1st meeting of the day with your heavy bag and high heels - it was not pleasant to start your day.

"You cannot leave Singapore without staying or at least having a drink at Marina Bay Sands. If you are staying only one night (as we did), do splurge yourselves by staying in the Club level. It may cost a little bit more, but it worth every cent.  Club guest have a VIP check in, which will save you an hour or more of your time in comparison to general check in. We’ve arrived just before 1pm and the queue for check in was 50-70 people. How happy we were to find VIP check in without any queue at all.  Also Club guests can enjoy complimentary buffet breakfast, afternoon tea with canapés and deserts, evening canapé hour with great variety of canapés, cheeses, cold meats and endless drinks (soft and alcoholic) and of course best views in town. Restaurant staff is great, they make you…",4
"This hotel is architecturally interesting and provides a welcome addition to the Singapore skyline. It was unfortunate that the haze was so thick because the views are probably outstanding. The best part of the hotel is the rooftop area with the amazing infinity pool, the observation deck and the restaurants. We spent a part of every day lounging by the pool and enjoying excellent service. The rest of the hotel has a ""Las Vegas"" feel to it with all of the celebrity restaurants, the high-end shops and the adequate rooms. I'm glad we experienced MBS, but I don't necessarily need to return. ",4
"Very nice resort, with lots of excellent shopping and great restaurants ... Just don't forget to leave, otherwise you will miss the essence and charm that Singapore has to offer in Chinatown and elsewhere!  Hotel rooms were great, infinity pool is a must visit and rooftop bars too.  The staff is very attentive to your every need, from check in to room service and pool side servers.",5
After seeing this from the helicopter camera from Formula 1 on TV I just had to stay one night and I am not disappointed. I was lucky and got a room upgrade and stayed almost at the top of the building. The view was fantastic and the room bigger than my small apartment :)  The Skypark with the infinity pool is very nice. Very crowded when not raining but that's expected. I recommend it and I would love to stay again if I'm in the area.,5
"My supposed luxurious experience started out with waiting in a long queue that took over forty-five minutes just to check into this hectic hotel. The lobby was a mess of tourists, employees and guests - you could barely get around. The suite that we received was nice, but not as nice as the price tag would lead you to believe.  Let's talk about the pool area - basically the reason you choose to stay at this overly-expensive hotel. I tried to make the best of the gloomy days I had during my stay at the MBS and purchased a ridiculously expensive cocktail from the pool bar (22 SGD). I could barely enjoy my cocktail with all the crazy children running around unattended. The children were even in the ""adults only"" area! What a joke! Then upon check out after a couple days at this…",3
"Despite the fact the haze in Singapore is not good.  That did not ruin my stay-cation here.  This is definitely a place to have fun, eat really good food, play some cards or slots, whatever your fancy is, relax at the spa or pool.    Service was and A+ from the moment we came in the door.  This busy hotel is not short on Hospitality.  From the front desk agent to room service, to the restaurant server, they are all trained so well.  I find that hospitality in Asia is not what I experience elsewere in the world. I feel that it is lacking in many ways by not anticipating needs, being sincere, or actually going the extra mile to help a guest.  I DID NOT experience this here.  It was first class all the way.  Do check out the pool area.  Now you may have to ignore the ridiculous…",4
Room are spacious and every bit you expect from a 5 star hotel. I stayed in city view room and the views are amazing from there.   The best part of the hotel is the infinity pool at 57th floor. Its breathtaking.   There is also some Jacuzzi at 57th Floor and is fun too.  Check in is at 3pm so if you arrive early you can leave your baggage with the concierge and go the next door shopping mall or the casino.  Breakfast is not included in the normal package so book accordingly.  Worth for a day.  Bhavesh,5
"Booked a staycation at the Orchid Suite, Marina Bay Sands Singapore and it was a pleasant stay for us.   My family of 4 enjoyed the spacious space and the room was facing the Gardens by the Bay. The suite offers a theatre room, a huge round dining table for 6, a separate bedroom with attached bath and it offers a lot of space for the kids to play. The staff are very polite and profession in their service and the butler service is excellent. Will plan for our next staycation at MBS!",5
"The staff make a massive difference in this hotel so kudos to them and their management teams! The service for me was outstanding!  Stayed here in one of the suites for a few nights. The hotel lobby is like an atrium to a mall or entertainment village in tower 1 but check in was seamless considering the number of rooms and people they have going through there.   The room itself was great, everything you need and spectacular views even through the haze.  If you are scared of heights the room has floor to ceiling windows which are great, but can be difficult if you don't like looking down from the 50th floor.   They even have the option of replacement fridges for a small fee if you don't want the mini bar service.   Restaurants are great in the hotel with some with great views. …",4
"What can one say about this beautiful hotel.  Perfect in every way.  Our check in was very easy, our rooms very spacious with everything you needed.  The breakfast in the breakfast room was the best we have ever seen.  Staff were excellent.  The sky pool was amazing.",5
"The hotel and property is unique. Between the Skypark, the attached mall/casino and entrance to Gardens by the Bay, there isn't a hotel like this. Checking in is fairly smooth though there may be some time wait depending of the number of people checking in at the time. Tip, be aware of which tower you're suppose to check in to. You may be given a room in a different tower from where you checked in. The service in the lobby is world class. Bell hops are very attentive. The desk staff was very friendly.  The room was gorgeous. Very spacious and well kept. Our room was facing Gardens by the Bay but we also had a view of the marina from our bathroom though it is only a window next to the bath tub. The balcony was also spacious. Barely any noise from the street can be heard. Overall…",5
"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands in Tower 1 for 2 nights (which was definitely not enough in order to see everything in this city). When we arrived our rooms were not yet ready, so we spent some time walking around in the hotel area and also had lunch there. After that our rooms were still not ready, so we were upgraded to a suite in the 50th floor! We couldn't believe our eyes when we first stepped into our room, it was huge (330 sq m, which is a lot even for 4 persons) and the view was breathtaking (we could see both the city side as well as Gardens by the Bay). The interior not only of our suite but also of the whole hotel was amazing, the infinity pool a little bit crowded but with an incredible view and the hotel staff very very nice. And of course a must-see: the light show…",5
Went to MBS to celebrate my son 1st birthday at Orchid Suite. Nice view of Garden Garden By The Bay from the balcony. The room is superb and big. The ambience is nice and cosy.  Parking is not a problem as they provide free valet service for inhouse guest. The pool was nice and the view is great except for the haze.   Recommended!!!,5
Great stay at the Sands . It's just a metropolis. Everyone was very helpful. Great views from Tower 1 57 Bar. It's a must if you in Singapore.  I would recommend this to all if you want to spoil yourself for a day or two. Book direct with the hotel for the best rate. ,5
"The staff are exceptional - but then again that's just the people of Singapore - and the rooms are gorgeous. The view is breathtaking... I was on the 48th floor looking over the Gardens on the Bay and it was a sensational view. Overall, it has all the things a good 5 star hotel has and we experinced VERY good service.",5
"It is all about the view. There are always some important ingredients in a great experience. I can't review the food, I can't barely review the drinks. A ginger ale remains a ginger ale but I can review the view at the Marina Bay Sands. That's awesome!",5
"We stayed in marina bay in September - and WOW - What a stay. We arrived very early in the morning on a Monday - Having flown 19 hours I was so ready for a shower and a change of clothes but given the time I was not expecting our room to be ready I was ready to check in and be told to sit and wait in the beautiful lobby. However on arriving at the check in desk not only was our room ready but we were upgraded to a room on the 52nd floor. Now Me and my other half have been looking forward to this holiday for quite some time - It's been planned and carefully booked throughout and when I opened the door to that room I could have cried, after months of building up the dream holiday in our head it completely blew me away. Everything from start to finish at this hotel was perfect. We…",5
"We stayed in a suite on the 22nd floor of Tower One with a city view.  This came with a complimentary cocktail hour with food that could certainly qualify as dinner and a breakfast/brunch buffet at Sky On 57.    The Good: 1.  The Pool is extraordinary - huge, well tended with gorgeous views.  The bar and snack service is efficient and attentive.  The pool opens early and doesn't close until 11PM. 2.  The food, both complimentary and that for which we paid additional (room service,) was excellent.   3.  The suite was large and well-appointed.  The Bad 1.  The drinks at the pool were quite over-priced.  They were good, but they were not generous with the alcohol, especially in the mixed cocktails.  (I'm being kind.  Twice I almost suspected there was no alcohol present at all.) 2.…",3
"I checked in Orchid Suites @1500 dollars/night, so I do get a very nice room with great view and the swimming pool was also great. Apart from this- everything is very poor. Check in requested was 1 PM(early check in) I reached there and after spending 30 minutes in designated express line for suite i managed to communicate with front desk. Room was not ready so they took my mobile no. with promise to call at the earliest possible time. No call came till 4:00 PM(even after usual check in time of 3 PM passed). I again stand in Queue for check in and after 30 hrs managed to communicate front desk and he took another 20 minutes to give room.  During stay, Fridge was not working, there was power failure, staff had no coordination. The Hotel is Overcrowded  no personalized service,…",2
"I have never been much of a long-haul traveller. I have tended to stay within Europe, being British means we have so many interesting places with a very short plane ride. This year I felt I definitely needed to stretch out and see something different. I used Skyscanner which returned some interesting destinations for the dates I had in mind, the best one being a bargain flight to Singapore which really piqued my interest. I had remembered about the Marina Bay Sands from a documentary of it's inception and development, the idea of actually seeing it was all I needed to go ahead and book the flights. I never expected to actually stay at Marina Bay Sands, but by being cautious with the budget we did indeed spend three nights at this colossal hotel. Spending six night's previously…",5
For the price you pay you expect the house keeping to properly clean the bathroom hair on the floor and sink was not cleaned properly really disappointing as was expecting really good things but unfortunately did not meet expectations. Check in times were very long ,2
"After seeing the spectacular rooftop pool you sadly experienced the best that this hotel has to offer. This hotel needs to shape up big time. If you still plan to stay here you better prepare for some serious queueing. Queues at check in, queues for breakfast, queues for check out. MBS is BIG, but unlike the best hotels in Las Vegas that compare its size, they haven't figured out how to combine size with great service. Not a recommendable place to go. A far better alternative is the Mandarin Oriental hotel at the opposite side of the bay. ",3
"I don't like this hotel. Poor services. Bad staff attitude, especially the staff from the Philippines, they will be nice to you, if you are white. Their service sucks. Room also not good and up to the name standard.  Went up to their Ce La Vi, nothing great as well there, sulky face everywhere for their staff, except for floor staff. The ushers at the door has the most sulkiest face. Check in taking more than 30 minutes per guest, even there is no large crowds. Basically nothing is good about this hotel, that is my 2nd impressions.  Even if I am sponsored to stay at this hotel, I will not stay again.",2
"One of the busiest hotel in singapore i believe, however staff is very friendly! The video check out is one of the best things they could have done to ensure swift check outs.... The room view is fantastic overlooking the splendid Gardens of the Bay and are huge, Clean and Modern....  For me as a business traveller, it is the most convenient hotel to stay at, as the convention is just connected to the hotel. There's plenty to do & look at (Casino & up-market shopping, or eating/drinking). The views are fantastic (ours was of the Gardens of the Bay) Breakfast was incredible & fresh & tasty. The pool is the main attraction & the views very impressive, day or night. The famous sond and laser show happens at the promenade in the night and is best viewed from merlion. I found the…",4
This place is incredible. We were blown away with the Casinos size and the amount of people lining up to use tables.  It is worth showing your passport to have a look inside even if not betting.  After the Casino we headed up Tower 1 to Sky Park. Instead of paying an entry fee just to get to the top of Tower 3 we decided to have a drink at the top of Tower 1. There is no need to pay to use the famous top floor as a beautiful cocktail is approx the same price at the restaurant. Level 57 is best to visit when the laser light show is on and the light show at Gardens By The Bay. We also shared some tapas. Delicious!!!  This will only allow access to the back deck but really it is better anyway. Only residents of MBSands are allowed to swim in and access the pool anyway.  Definate…,5
"Stayed here few times,always good,typical 5 star hotel,good service,friendly staff,good rooms,good shopping.Pool is always a must when in Marina bay, ces't la vie for a night out is a must when in Singapore too.Perfect for couples,holidays with friends ,wont advice it much for family vacations too overcrowded for me.",4
Stayed here for 2 nights. Upon checking n we were upgraded to a Club room which was very nice. The hotel is large and includes a large mall and casino complex. There are lots of restaurants in the complex encompassing a huge range of cuisines. The infinity pool n the 57th floor is amazing! It is strictly for hotel guests only. The staff everywhere are very friendly and helpful. Our only disappointment was one evening we up to the Skydeck to have a drink and both rooftop bars were closed for or at functions. There is so much close-by do do and the MRT is right there so easy to get around Singapore.,5
"WOW!! What a amazing experience it was.  My family and I arrived to Marina Bay Sands hotel by the bus about 9 pm. When we went to the check-in counter the clerk welcomed us and started the check-in process. after 2 minutes he told us that we got a big surprise and he couldn't tell yet. Also, he told us that we got one room instead of two.  We got keys to one room on 51st. floor. we didn't know nothing and we went to the elevator. and then we saw the big surprise : The Presidential suite. The room consist of 2 big Bedrooms, 2 restrooms with huge Jacuzzi hot tub, Big living room with piano, kitchen, small gym, massage room and private karaoke room!! I can't describe the view from this room - like the pool on 57th floor you can see all Singapore. We didn't want to leave the room,…",5
"Best view from Nice Pool in Singapore. Everything seems like perfect except one thing. Maybe its just my fault. Bcoz I didnt know if i touch drink in fridge, i have to pay all even i didnt open or drink it. And i took all of it to see ( just bcoz of curiousness) Well, I was so surprise when i got bill. When i came back room to take that things bcoz i paid all of it but fridge blocked T.T Ok.... It was funny experience in my birthday . Anw, I dont know why u guys do that in 5 stars hotel.",4
"Stayed for 3 nights in the junior suite.  Plus points: 1. Infinity pool - no doubt the star attraction! Offers stunning views of Singapore  2. Room - very comfortable and modern with panoramic views of Singapore  3. The shopping arcade in its basement- handy 4. Spa - very good service albeit expensive 5. Location - fantastic, in the heart of the city and right next door to the lovely Bay Gardens  Less good:  1. Check in can take a while  2. When asking for small complimentary bottles of water from housekeeping in the middle of the night they asked us to buy them. Given they only offer two small bottles of 500 ml and we were staying there for three nights in a rather costly junior suite, that attitude was outrageous  3. Whenever we needed something it would take a while to get it ",4
"although its the busiest hotel in singapore i believe, never seen the staff are without a smile on their face! Rooms are huge. For me as a business traveller, it is the most convenient hotel to stay at, as the convention is just connected to the hotel (avoiding the haze). Glad to know that it will be the official hotel for itb asia the next 4 years! Hooray! ",4
You would love the every bit of the hotel with pool to night club and casino. It's fun to explore all part of hotel. It's too big and can get u lot of walking. The service are good with friendly staff. The pool or the skypark is awesome . It indulge you thru out the day without getting sick.  ,4
"My wife & I stayed here in September for 3 nights. Although we arrived from Dubai at 9am, and there wasn't a room available for us (usual check-in is 3pm) the staff quickly checked us in, looked after our bags, offered us seats & refreshments in a very comfortable waiting lounge. We had a room at 1pm (2 hrs early). There's plenty to do & look at whilst waiting (Casino & up-market shopping, or eating/drinking). The room was huge, clean, modern PERFECT. The views are fantastic (ours was of the Gardens of the Bay) Breakfast was incredible & fresh & tasty. The pool is the main attraction & the views very impressive, day or night.

Marina Bay Sands is simply the best. Visit it once in your life.  Visited first week of October we headed up to their Skybar called Cie La Vie. You can go directly at the bar and order your drinks. Cocktails are at 24 sgd. If you want to have a table near the edge of the bar theres a minimum order of 500sgd (not unless you had dinner at their restaurant then you can just transfer outside) If youre not up for the expense. Just try to order cocktails as theyre the less expensive one.   ,5
The best place I have seen in Singapore.the best view of the whole city from the top skypark and to the amazing towers.the shopping experience is amazing.so many tourists come to this beautiful city..,4
"We recently stayed in the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) for a couple of nights in a cityside Orchid Suite as part of the celebrations for my 50th birthday.   From the outset, don't expect personalised service at MBS. Your adventure commences after making your way across the chaos of the hotel lobby, to then join a 100m check-in in queue. 15 minutes or so later you will get to the front desk, where they won't be able to find your reservation. 15 minutes after that they will find your reservation, and in our case, the room was ready.  Finally with key in hand we headed to our room, which was approx 1km away from the check-in desk which is in tower 1, and our room was in tower 3 at the opposite end. You can look closely at the architecture on your walk, as it is truly a marvel to look at…",4
A vast hotel with almost everything one would require for a holiday or business trip.  My wife and I stayed there three nights in a suite with our two children (ages 3 and 5); the pool on the roof was a massive hit - and had a huge wow factor!   The food was brilliant and a night out was a similar in price to most other hotels in the Marina Bay.   ,4
"I was at MBS for a company banquet and we had the banquet at their massive ballrooms on the 4th floor of the convention hall.   The meal had 7 course, with free flow of beer, hot Chinese tea and soft drinks - Opening course to the 7 course banquet: Cold dish platter. The highlights: Scallops were plump, spring rolls were crispy. Smoked duck was alright.   - Wok-fried prawns, sliced chicken, asparagus and capsicums. I don't usually like asparagus, but it's done really well. Sauce is good.   - Double-boiled chicken soup with shimeji mushroom: Soup was tasty and the chicken in the soup was tender and soft. Other ingredients – scallop and mushrooms were bland.  - Braised mushroom with broccoli in oyster sauce: Lots of cut broccoli blanched and topped with braised mushroom and sauce.…",3
Comfortable beds and large bathroom. Great service. Breakfast and evening cocktail at the club on the top floor was nice. Stayed on top floors facing the Gardens By The Bay and the view was spectacular.,5
"An excellent hotel, beautifully designed, perfectly set to to take anyone to newer heights of hospitality. The elevation, the view and the ambiance is in parallel. The Sky Park is the peak of excitement. Service good and value good",5
A beautiful property with stunning view of Singapore on one side and Garden by the bay on another side. The infinity pool is amazing my kind da just loved being in the pool   Location is also easy access to all places as connected by metro  Service is of high standard the staff is always smiling,5
"We stayed at Marina Bay sands for 3 nights, very expensive but it was worth it, loved the room, we had a premium room overlooking the Marina Gardens it was spectacular at night! Room was big, bed was very comfy and bathroom was big with a big stand alone spa and rain shower. Hotel is so big cannot believe how busy it was, the Pool was the best except we had Haze for the 3 days so our photos are not the best!  Shopping is too expensive for the average Joe, but we took a taxi to Orchard Road where we went to Lucky Plaza and bought our souvenirs from there really cheap. One night we went to China Town and had the BEST  Chili Crab ever.  On the last night we went to the Hotel Casino, and won $900 dollars on the poker machines so we were very happy!

1. One of the most organised hotels I have ever visit 2. The personnel is profetional and very well trained  3. Big variety of restaurants and large choice of food to taste 4. Breakfast is perfect  5. The rooms are comfortable with very nice view 6. The swimming pool was the highlight of my staying there 7. Try the butter and bread pudding - delicious,5
"I think you can get better service for the price of this hotel. It's really massive and, but considering it's a hotel with capacity of over 3.000 people, the service is great. The pool is probably the best I've used in my life, with an awesome view. Breakfast at the top floor is also great, delicious food with great views. If you can, it's really woth it to pay a little extra to stay in a high level room, because the hotel is all about the views. When I go back to Singapore, I will be definetely be staying there.",5
"My husband booked us into MBS as a birthday present for me, as we are currently living in Singapore.  We decided to book a club room, as we'd already decided to have breakfast there and that combined with the afternoon tea and canapés with cocktails/champagne in the club lounge meant the club rooms were good value.  We were checked in by Vance; he was really nice and helpful. Our room was on the 25th floor, tower one overlooking Gardens by the bay. It was a gorgeous and very spacious room with a long balcony which we watched the supertrees show from (at GBTB).  It has a huge shower and a good sized bath.  We spent a lot of time relaxing by the pool on the top of MBS. It was very busy by late afternoon, we couldn't get sunbeds by the pool which didn't bother us as we prefer the…",5
"Have stayed on The Fullerton, but this tops it all (and if you want access to the pool, you have to be a guest of the hotel).   Try to get access to The Club on 55th. Here you have breakfast without the browds, afternoon tea and evening snacks!! And the best view you can imagine. Worth the money. ",5
"Marina Bay Sands has been the icon of Singapore and will always be.   It's a sure place to go whenever you visit SG.   Apart from the world-class service, what i love the most is the architectural designs inaide the hotel. It was truly breath-taking.   Make sure you jump into the infinity pool at the top of the hotel. One of the beat city views you'll have while in Singapore.   Enjoy the patisseries as well, those are simply jaw-dropping.",5
"This is an incredible hotel.  It's worth a trip just to look at the design and architecture.  A buzzing icon in the incredible city of Singapore.   We travelled as a family (with 4 & 8 year old) in October 2015.   We opted for a suite with city view, as we like a bit more room when travelling with children, and also we were only staying for one night en route from Malaysia to the UK.  The room was massive!  Plenty of storage space, lounge space and large bedroom and bathroom.  Perhaps the only additional thing I would have liked would have been a separate wc in this size of room.  The suite contained a sofa bed which was suitable for our 2 girls.  We were also offered additional beds, and we could have had a few extra beds in there and still had loads of room.  Lovely dining…",5
"Must stay hotel when in Singapore at least once... very unique and iconic landmark with astonishing views of Singapore. Good location, obviously you can not miss three big & tall towers. Plenty of transportation options with MRT station connecting to the hotel and affordable taxi price to get there from anywhere in the city...   Everything is kept clean and up to 5 star standard. Good facilities and good quality of products. Staffs are exceptionally friendly and helpful with good local and product knowledge.   A lot of restaurants in the hotel complex but quite expensive and overpriced.   Roof top pool on 57th floor is just impressive. Amazing experience to enjoy the view of Singapore.

"My husband and I stayed 3 nights in the hotel and we chose it mainly because of the pool.  As we were on our honeymoon we were given a room with a king sized bed overlooking the Gardens by the Bay, so the views were absolutely spectacular, specially at night. The room was big and pristine clean. The hotel provided slipers and bathrobes that could be taken to the pool. At the pool there was also a towel concierge which meant that we didn't need to worry to carry anything with us aside from the room keys (necessary to access the pool as it's for guests only). The pool is open from 6am to 11pm, which allowed us to enjoy the city during the day and some night swimming at night. All the staff were very helpful and polite.

"I stayed at the marina bay sands in October during the Sibos week. I must say that this hotel definitely exceeded my expectation in terms of grandeur, efficiency of service and overall feel good experience.   The Sibos conference is intense with over 2000 demanding bankers staying at the hotel. I must say that the hotel showed its customary singapore efficiency in managing us. The concierge would pick up the call on second ring, my breakfast would be served on time in my room everyday, the room would be serviced on time perfectly.....being from service industry myself I can appreciate this esp knowing how busy the hotel was during this time.   The breakfast spread was elaborate with multi cuisine, the infinity pool is a great experience and one of a kind. I had been upgraded to…",5
"If you visit Singapore you must have a drink at the sky bar, the views are amazing and they have some excellent wines, a must do!",5
The hotel was very good the room was large and fantastic views the only flaw was the crowd. It was very busy especially at the pool. But all on all very good stay and great staff. It was like a transit airport we stayed here because it's meant to be an iconic place but really if I visit Singapore again I would stay at mandarin oriental and just visit here for one day only ,4
"This is an exceptional and luxurious landmark hotel overseeing the Marina Bay of Singapore. The architecture is quite astonishing. The three towers are built in a x-shape, and support an impressive top terrace with swimming pool across the 3 towers. Despite the impressive construction, the surface on the top remains limited; so it can be a bit more crowded. Not really for people with a fear of heights. The hotel and its surrounding shopping area and restaurants are very expensive. After a couple of days, you have seen it all and probably spent the money you were planning to spend. We were unlucky that there was a serious haze at the time of the visit, limiting the view from the room and from the top. Most materials in the hotel are of very high quality. The rooms start however…",5
"During our trip to Singapore we stayed in 2 different hotels and spent 2 nights at Marina Bay Sands mainly because of the famous swimming pool which only guests have access. The hotel is beautiful, has an incredible architecture, but in the middle of so many people, there is no special treatment and for a couple on honeymoon, we were a little disappointed... No one even offers to help you with your luggage, you need to ask. It seems silly, but when they saw a woman, I think it should be natural to offer help. I recommend the experience because of the pool, it is worth for at least one night, but if you want a warmer reception, Marina Bay Sands is not the best place.",4
"1. Too crowded. As you may imagine this is a destination in itself. The infinity pool is filled with people at any given time. 2. Owing to the large number of visitors the attention from the staff is poor. They are often too busy at least to smile and the hospitality is not great if you compare with SEA tourist hot-spots like Thailand/Bali.  3. Food is nice. 4. Not worth the money. 5. Haze!! Although it not the hotel's fault, the haze minimizes the views and makes it impossible to breathe some fresh air. The haze was at dangerous levels when we visited.   If your expectation is to see the architectural landmark, please stay at a nearby hotel and pay a visit to the MBS observation deck for less than $30. If you intend to visit the pool, unfortunately you have to be a guest!  …",3
"If you want a bit of wow then this hotel has got it. Very grand, very big and very nice. Everything about the hotel is very good i don't need to say any more. It is connected to the casino, a shopping mall and the subway. You can walk from the hotel around the lake and there are many place for eating and entertainment. Spending a few days in Singapore and want to get away from the Orchard Road boredom then this is a great alternative.  I definitely recommend this hotel.",5
"Probably not the best hotel in Singapore, but was attending a conference at the Expo and five minutes from the bedroom to the Expo floor was a real benefit. Rooms are very comfortable and have all amenities you need. I had a room facing the Gardens at the Bay and would recommend trying to obtain a city view. Good bars and restaurants in the complex. Infinity pool is a plus and good gym. Price was expensive SGD550++ and not the best value for money, but location on this visit was everything. Would certainly return on a personal basis at a more reasonable price.",4

Massive king size bed and an amazing amount of storage space. Nespresso coffee machine and a kettle to make a cup of tea.

The only reason to stay here is for the sky park.  The pool is excellent and the views are amazing.  Unless you are a millionaire I would not recommend ordering any food or drinks as a $10 bottle of Australian wine was $70 and a $40 bottle of scotch $250!!!!  Talk about mark ups.  Certainly nothing the average person could afford.,4
"We were a little nervous at staying in this hotel due to the volumes of people, but we were pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, a lot of people stay here - it's just serviced very well. We stayed in tower 3 facing Marina bay on the 44th level in an orchid suit. The view and the room were both spectacular. Although the haze was quite bad while we there, the view was amazing. The room itself was spacious and very clean. We had access to 'The Club' for breakfast and cocktail hour/s included in our nightly rate, boy was that good value! We had free drinks here 3 out of 4 night stay and were so full from the incredible 5 star quality canapés on offer, we didn't end up eating dinner.  The pool is, well it's the iconic pool that everyone has a photo in. Yes we did take multiple…",5
"It is a luxury hotel indeed. We stayed here for 3 nights, and I regret it. I should have stayed here for only 1 night. Why? because this hotel is very expensive and we are out all day for the tour. We are not able to experience well their amazing places for activities.  I should have allotted my 1 day spending it to the hotel. This is not just an ordinary hotel, they have exquisite bar, infinity pool, observatory deck, spa, and more. Staying here is enough to enjoy.  it is very clean. Courteous Staff and services. Superb food. Amazing experience.  Again it is expensive but it is worth it.",4
"Its a very nice stay. Very nice swimming pool, great experience to swim at high roof. Infinity view from swimming pool its a very difference experience, can view singapore high building of financial hub. My childs are very enjoy to stay here. Good location, great services, high security, good food, very nice view from our room at night time.  ",5
"My wife and I visited this hotel for two nights in the beginning of September. We booked a Premier Room but were upgraded to a Suite on arrival.  I have read here in TA that the service in this hotel might feel impersonal. But we were approached all the time by name and could feel a very attentive treatment by the staff that was always eager to help.  Yes, it´s true, the place is huge. But let´s be honest, the hotel itself is a tourist attraction. It is without a doubt the spotlight of the whole Marina Bay area. The Gardens by the Bay, the Shoppes and the Singapore Flyer are surrounding the hotel. And if that is not enough, the hotel boasts probably one of the most impressive swimming pools on Earth and certainly the best view of the Marina Bay.  We stayed our first two nights…",5
"If you arrive at Tower 1, the main entrance, you may feel the stress of the staff trying to keep the traffic in front of the hotel under control. Quite a challenge actually. Then you will feel like arriving at the check-in desk at the airport, with a long queue in front of you. We eventually did not wait for too long, but the check-in process took at least 15 minutes, very unusual for Asia.  Our executive room on the 49th floor was a bit smelly as we arried (the air is very humid in Singapore). We asked if they could do something and withing minutes they brought an air purifier which helped. The room was quite large, with a beautiful view over Singapore. The bed is excellent. One negative element is the lack of storage space. As we were traveling for two weeks we had a lot of…",4
"Situated right on the seashore on ""bayfront"" area, this location has a lot to offer....starting right from Merlion statue, Fullerton Hotel, Wonderfull light show(check the timings in the evening), OCBC Gardens(again, the timings), The observation deck( 3 towers, 57th floors, fantastic view of seashore, ships, gardens below, light show) and shopping at the basement of Marina Bay sands hotel. In fact, staying at this hotel has its own advantages in accessing the premium floors. Then on the other side you have the helix bridge, Singapore flyer and other attractions.  You need two well planned evenings to check out all the attractions here. Then this place is very close to Chinatown and Little India , just in case you want to club the visits that can start in the afternoon. You can…",4
I guess my disssapointment set in as I was expecting a fantastic room and service. Room was on a high floor and that was the only highlight.  Rooms are very basic in every way. Extremely dissapointed at the cleaning which took place only after I called late in the evening when I returned from a days work. Unacceptable.  Laundry I have never arrived on time and had to chase...I boil it down to being  a large hotel that hard to keep up with the standards one finds in other places. Staff need to be trained and the help desk one calls need to be more aware of the challenges clients face. One gets blazed with the roof top however what's beneath if dismall...with what one pays it was the worst place I have stayed in based on quality one got. ,1
"we had the best room it was in tower 3 and had very close view of the gardens by the bay, the trees all had beautiful light show at night time, the pool was magnificent although very crowded and a little noisy especially at night time the rooms were vey well appointed and we found the staff very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast buffet was awesome.",5
"You cannot beat how spectacular this hotel is and it is worth to fork out some more money to get one of the Orchid Suits that are in the higher floors with the view across Singapore Bay and the City. Just absolutely stunning. The rooms are just very high spec, floor to ceiling windows lets you look across the city when you go to bed or wake up. Living room and bathroom just out of this world. The Skypark with the bars, Restaurants and the pool just stunning. It is one of my most favourite City Hotels ever and there is nothing bad to say about it but you got to have one of the Suites as that means not only do you have the best location, you as well have a different check in as this being a large hotel and a lot of weekend tourists, it can get very busy indeed.",5
From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were made to feel like a VIP.  Our room was on 4th floor facing the garden. Perfect as we saw the light show that night. We watched this from our terrace.  The bathroom was very luxurious. The pool level was beyond expectations. We walked through the shopping mall and had a lovely meal at a french restaurant. Would love to come and stay again. ,5
"Checked in at the giant lobby which is as busy as a train station in Jakarta. For the price paid and expectations to the hotel, waiting 15 in line to check in is unacceptable. Floor 45 city view and access to the Club. The room was nice but with a strange smell, like somebody had been smooking and the housekeeping had used all their sprays. How ever we decided to stay in the room as is had a great view of Singapore city. The room is big with king bed and a sofa section plus a desk. Big windows to enjoy the view. The breakfast in the club good with great service. Afternoon tea had a lot of choices and was a pleasant surprise. Cocktail hours are very short and after 7 pm there are no more access to the club! That's not acceptable by any hotel standard and especially not with the…",3
"I had visited this hotel magnificient architect  hotel  when i was in singapore. The entrance is huge with many shopees of all brands more than 50 restaurants, theatres, museum, and casino amazing gorgeous hotel. There are lot many cafe shoppes too Bean Bistro  is where i had good Hot capuccino.& rise restaurant lunch buffet is where i had lunch . At the sky line awesome swimming pool with sky restaurant... Worth and must visit in singapore.  Regards Sri (stunningshri@yahoo.in)",4
Stayed at this hotel. Beautiful hotel very clean n 1st class std. The infinity pool packed with adults n children for a swim. Easy access to shopping mall n casino n restaurants to wet one's appetite.,5
"Beautiful hotel in the centre of the city.  My family and I stayed here after a few days on Sentosa to visit some of the places nearer the city centre.    Everyone stays for the pool and it doesn't disappoint (particularly at night) but other than that the hotel is similar to many '5 star' resorts.    A mini fridge cost us 10 dollars to rent for our stay as we couldn't put anything in the fridge provided.   Very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay, but will probably look to stay at other nearby hotels next time we're in Singapore.  ",4
"We only stayed one night as we could not afford more but the experience was great! I've never stayed in a place like it! The infinity pool is incredible, but watch that if you want a drink inside the bar next to it, there is a dress code (however you can order drinks poolside). The views from both sides are amazing. They offer everything you could think of, from tailors to babysitters. And the room is huge! Definitely a great place, you could spend all day on here if Singapore wasnt as amazing in itself.",5
"This trip was a lazy weekend getaway for the family. away from work. We were impressed with the view. The service was great though food and services were on the high side. The bar in the room has a sensor ,so be careful if you intend to place something in there and remove (temporary) some of their items. We did and the bar got locked. The hotel graciously allowed us to use one shelf and did not charge us for the items which we did not use. Around the Hotel, we have numerous shops, luxurious and up market. There is also a train station (MRT)  which will take you out and you can do your shopping . And not forgetting the ""Casino"", which is all linked to the hotel. A short walk will bring you to the Foodcourt as well. Prices here are price reasonably but a far cry from our Hawker…",5
"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights ..... not long enough to see all the sights and truly experience this magnificent hotel! Our room on the 40th floor was large and luxurious, with rose petals on the bed and floating in the bath tub.. very romantic! The shopping center adjacent to the hotel was world class with every brand imaginable. The first night we dined at Jian Shan Chinese Restaurant.. the service and food could not be faulted. The second night we dined at CUT - truly amazing food and service! The third night we dined at SPARGO on their opening night ... this is fine dining at it's best! A truly memorable experience! Well done to Vance and his team!",5
"Yes, similar reviews to others.  The price was average, to be expected for the sky park attraction they have. The service was below average, unfriendly, unwelcoming, bad vibes, they seemed moody. I hardly talked to any of them because of their stance. All I did was ask a direction to somewhere to one of the staff and was given a stare. My room was small, and not sound proof, I could hear people outside waiting in line to go into a bar. But on the positive, as is the reason most people stay here.. The skypark attraction, is beautiful, and a breathtaking pool and view. In the end it was worth it",3
"We spend 3 nights at club room on the 41 floor. As you can expect, the best thing about that hotel is the swimming pool on top of the roof. It was really amazing!!! The hotel is nice and clean. The view is also amazing!!! But don't get fooled - you pay just for the architecture and for the famous roofpool. All other things are about average! I booked a club room on the 41 floor and it wasn't what you expect for that price!!! You can get sooo much more for your money at some of the hotels nearby.  I booked a club room for 2 adults and a child 7 years old, but when we arrived it appeared that the club for our daughter is not included in the price!!!  We travel a lot and it is the first time that we have to pay extra for the child when we have a club reservation!?! There is nothing…",3
Marina Bay Sands is THE ULTIMATE hotel in Singapore!  I remember not going out during my entire stay! I just stayed at the world famous pool located at the roofdeck from morning til night and savored each moment.  The rooms are unbelievably big and luxurious!,5
The rooms were clean and staffs were polite and helpful. Loved the infinity pool and the shopping mall there. The shopping mall had almost all the brands and there was a gift shop for buying souvenirs. Access to metro and other sightseeing places was really convenient. The only thing which disappointed me was the food options for vegetarians. Otherwise everything was perfect. ,5
"I check in into the hotel during a holiday in Singapore & check in was fantastic.   When i reached into my room i was expecting a luxurious room as Marina Bay Sands would serve its reputation, but when i entered the room they looked like any other normal 4 star room ,ofcourse they stood out thanks auto curtains & Spacious room with spacious terrace. but the overall room feel was 4 star. When i booked in Marina Bay Sands i was expecting something like Venetian ,Macau rooms.  Marina Bay property is Humongous. its so well planned & so well executed that you forget about the room & get hooked on to the hotel. that is exactly what happened with me.   After check in i went to the Infinity pool & feel in LOVE . what a exquisite beauty. it was mesmerizing & made me feel so relaxed…",5
"We could only afford to stay one night but it was definitely worth it. This is a luxury hotel with superb service but is also very friendly and welcoming. I was treated like a VIP even though I don't look like one! I'm sure every guest is given the same treatment. Only stayed here to swim in the Infinity Pool and wasn't disappointed - exceeded our expectations.  Although the pool area is busy everyone is happy and relaxed and enjoying the amazing views, which are even better at night. Most people were taking photos and there were lots of GoPro's but it didn't feel invasive, just good fun. My kids were asked to take videos and photos for people. Pool not just for the beautiful people - all ages and shapes represented. There are plenty of pool lounges, warm towels are provided and…",5
"If you are expecting quaint and traditional go to Raffles, this is big, brash and Vegas in Singapore. It's a great hotel with some superb dining and it's definitely worth staying if you book a club room with access to their lounge. Great service but the big problem is this... The crowds, the rooftop pool is without doubt the highlight but NO ONE is swimming or enjoying it , they're all taking selfies, I travel the world and have never seen so many bloody selfie sticks uuurgh!! Stay one night, have your swim, take your selfie and then book into the Fullerton or Raffles  ",4
"This is a spectacular hotel and everything is ""grand"" about it, with the infinity pool at the rooftop beeing the icing on the cake. Good, spacious rooms, extremely friendly service at all areas. However, it is a large hotel givng it a less personal and luxurious feel in my view (compared to luxurious boutique hotels). The gym is tiny for such a huge hotel and get very crowded at certain times.",4
"Free wifi access, free entry to infinity pool, great housekeeping staff. Book the premier room and it was awesome, i stayed on the 40th floor and the view is spectacular at night. The room was big and i really like the way the room look. I was here to celebrate my gf birthday and guess what?! They gave me a complimentary cake for celebration! Awesome!!! ",4
"Right from the time I saw the building from the MRT near the airport, I knew my stay here would be special.   I stayed here for a night in a Premium ""City View"" room on the 41st floor and the views afforded from the room was nothing short of fantastic. As you slide the key into its slot, upon entering the room, the curtains automatically open, giving you a panoramic view over Marina Bay and the city beyond. The room itself is quite large, by asian standards and the loo, proportionately so. The loo had a stand alone tub, a separate shower, commode and his and her washbasins. Adequate lighting all over.  I had been forewarned to ask for a ""city view"" room as the other side of the hotel gives one views of the harbour and the shipping activity.   The best part, however, is the view…",4
"The most amazing place I've ever been in my life and I've been to some lovely places! Came here to watch the f1. food, drinks and staff were all amazing! The restaurant on the roof is out of this world and the shops at the bottom are even better! The pool was lovely and clean and very spacious! Would love to return hopefully for the honeymoon! ",5
"We arrived later in the evening, after some trouble finding our booking we where given an upgrade to a suite ! Lovely room with ample space for our family of 4, beautiful amenities. The only downside was the Haze which was wide spread and covered our view (not that the hotel can control this). We loved the Infinity pool ( found the state of water not 100% could do with keeping this as pristine as the rest of the hotel). Concierge were very helpful in getting one of bags open, the room service breakfast was good but not great. Enjoyed our stay would stay again. I think if you go expecting 5 star you may be disappointed - this is a large Motel with many guests, you go for the architecture and the infinity pool and you will be pleased you went.",4
"The iconic infinity pool is worth the stay just by itself, especially if you are luckier than we have been and there is no haze to block your view of Singapore. Still, a great facility.  Check-in and out was smooth and the staff efficient. Room service a bit slow at times. We recommend a room on a high floor with a view of the city.  Breakfast expensive, we did not go for it. Lots of options in MBS shopping area. Coffee and tea facilities in the room could be improved.  I might return, the location is great and well connected by MRT and the ""shoppes"" are great.",4
"This isnt my first time in MBS however I didnt get to review them. Everything was perfect! Sure the hotel is always crowded since it is most probably an iconic building & landscape in Singapore. Check-in was pretty quick, they have several counters located in each tower. Since it was crowded we checked in at the VIP service desk(mom told me to, and we didn't get rejected). We booked a club room for 5 nights and that includes breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktail. The breakfast was good with great variety except that it doesn't change everyday. Evening cocktail was the best, free flow alcohol, luxury canapés with finest ingredient like foie gras, caviars and crustaceans. Seriously I can even pass a day without having to buy another food just like a full board hotel.…",5
(+): Iconic Singapore Hotel Great city view pool Mall integrated  (-): Too expensive  Average room design for 5★ iconic hotl No ecowasher/jetwasher closet A bit noisy room as use common material of window Better choose premier room if stay more than 2persons,3
"We stayed here on our last night in Singapore, mainly because of the infinity pool on the 57th floor! It didnt dissapoint! We would never usually spend so much on 1 night in a hotel room but as we had the whole of Sunday afternoon free, we thought a good way to spend it would be at the hotel...we wanted to get our moneys worth! We sure did, the room was so cool and the blinds open up everytime you enter! The bed was huge and the whole room was immaculate. We spent most of the afternoon/evening at the infinity pool, swimming, taking pictures, enjoying the view and drinking cocktails...also got to see the laser light show! You can only visit the pool if you are staying at the hotel and it is definatley worth it.",5
Well this is the second time around that i've check in and it was an amazing experience once again.I had a breakfast at club lounge which is previously at 57th floor.I still remember one staff and hope she recognize me. Mirdy gave us an excellent and friendly service.Sincere and warm smile.Variety of food is very much appreciated.Definetely to come back again.,5
"I stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for a few days for a conference in April 2015.  The hotel is nice, but there are not too many facilities.",4
"The rooftop sky bar wthin this magnificent building was disappointing and a let down by our experience - other bars were prepared to adopt their cocktails to our taste and service was with a smile. In contrast we did not have the atmosphere or service we grew to expect from the rest of Singapore. Other than the views, our expectations of this bar were reduced by the experience - expensive does not mean quality.",2
"Great Location , Heart of the city, Room size is sufficient big with balcony, Ultimate, very big, Great, highest swimming pool in the world, Good Jacuzzi, Breakfast is good,only I suggest that they should give 2 liter drinking water per person, overall enjoyed a lot & I think that I'm giving five star first time to any property ",5
"I expected more of a hotel with such a high price. I have been to many good hotels in the past, but this one is just the worst one. I was staying for a few night and had a suite. I had to wait more than 30 minutes for check in, the breakfast ( 60sgd) was terrible, super crowded and I had to wait before there was a table. I see a lot of positive reviews, but these people probably never stayed at Ritz or Shangri-la. The pool was good, but drinks start at 25 sgd and the pool is just 120 cm deep ( not really possible to swim. Also, if you wish to eat at the hotel, reserve a few days in advance",2
Had to stay there for a conference. The hotel room is very impersonal and the service is really poor. You can feel that the hotel is all driven by the casino tourists. The architecture of the building and the stunning view from the top floor is really the only reason why you should have a short stop there.  The lobby is really noisy and packed as a railway station at peak rush time.,2
"Just was a bad time to visit with a lot of haze caused by the forestry fire in Indonesia. It is a very busy hotel, but check in was a breeze. Very courteous staff.  An upgrade to the higher floors in the 50 range was worth it overlooking the bay.  Rooms were spacious with free wifi. The infinity pool was relaxing if you head out early enough with less of a crowd.",5
"Clearly a must visit for all. The sky deck gives an amazing view. Make sure you go there late in the evening as you get a much better sight of the Singapore skyline. The shopping options are expensive, but worth a browse. The casino is also a must visit.",5
"I wasn't sure what to expect of Marina Bay Sands as I'd heard mixed reviews about it prior to going. I think to put it in perspective, we have to remember that it is an enormous complex - over 2,000 rooms, which is going to give the hotel a certain feel.  The good:  1) That infinity pool. One of the big drawcards of the hotel, and yes it is as amazing as advertised. As many photos as I'd seen online, I was still blown away - it is simply stunning.  2) The hotel is visually stunning and impressive to look at - just standing at the base of the towers inspires a sense of awe, the sheer magnitude of it. It is also conveniently next to Gardens by the Bay.  The bad: nothing happens quickly. As mentioned earlier, the hotel has over 2,000 rooms. Whilst the rooms themselves are clean and…",5
"Went there for a family staycation. It is a very busy hotel with long Q at the checking in and checking out counter. Chinese Tour group shouting across the lobby. Kind of the very chaotic feeling and I personally does not like such feeling when I check into any hotel.   The mini bar have sensor in it so for everything that is being remove, it will automatically charge to the bill and should you need another frigde, it is a cost. They will only provide 2 bottle of mineral water. I tried calling asking for another 2 bottle and was rejected right away with no reason given. Should they have some standard answer since it is a 5 start hotel.   Room was clean after noon. We went out for breakfast and when we return, it is still not clean. went for swim and it is still not clean when we…",3
"Unfortunately, we arrived in Singapore when it was hazy. Taxi fare from Changi airport to MBS was SD25. We checked in to MBS pretty early in the morning and were ushered into the Checking In Lounge (where there are sofas, coffee & tea, water). Our room was not ready yet at the time so we were told to come back around 12 noon for the room. However, we were given key cards so we could use the facilities (including going up to the restaurants and infinity pool on the 57th floor). With great location, on-site casino,  shopping precincts, food court & MRT station, it felt like you are in its own little town! City view room is fairly large with floor to ceiling window opens to the city, unfortunately due to haze, the view was not great at the time. Overall cleanliness was excellent.…",4
"We did not stay at the hotel but went to see the lights come on in the bay at dusk. We enjoyed not only the view but the service and the dry Singapore Sling was a delicious accompaniment to our fresh oysters and ribs. Lucas, the bar manager I think stopped by to talk to us and it was great to hear some advice from him ",5
"Ok, the infinity pool is clearly impressive, the rooms are also great especially the ones with the city views. The spa on 55 is also fantastic, but the sheer size of the hotel makes the service completely unpersonalised including room service which is basically a call centre fielding requests.  It is difficult to be here and relax. The pool is heaving with people, they decided background music was necessary so softly played chart music can be heard across the pool area, and choosing a restaurant to dine in, is a monumental task where trying to physically visit each one may take you more than a couple of hours (the website is probably the best as the in-room documentation was slightly out of date - no mention of the latest Spago on 57 for example).  For me a hotel needs to be a…",2
Had a really disappointing experience with this Hotel. They have a surcharge for Additional Adult in room for which they provide rollaway Bed but they don't confirm the extra bed until you check in. Doesn't make sense as if you are accepting additional adult it is only reasonable to expect confirmed additional bed! Otherwise during check in if no bed is provided where does the 3rd Adult sleep? On the floor? I can understand this practise for child under 12 who do not attract any surcharge!,2
"Great building and the only reason i visited is to experience the infinite pool and it worth the experience.  Staff were great, checkin and check out were fast and smooth.  The room was modern (a bit tired and old furniture) with a specious toilet, breakfast was not good despite the wide range of food.  The location is not central so you have to take transport (metro / taxi) to get to orchard road.  The attached mall is nice and there are some nice eateries in and out.  Very close to the garden by the bay.  The only reason for me to stay in this hotel was the pool and i am not going to stay in it again.",3
"Awesome place with night lights show which is a must.  However  there's a fee to get to the  very top of the place to view Singapore.  There's an infinity pool there which is only for hotel guest of course.  Shopping is all high end fashion house like Dior, Chanel, Prada etc.  there's a very good food court there.",5
I highly recommend to stay in this hotel. Be sure to spend time in the pool on the roof. It is imposible to get out of it)) Perfect view and nice atmosphere! Impressions are unforgettable. Rooms and breakfast are good as well,5
"This is by far the most overrated & overpriced hotel I have EVER been to!!!  For $700 a night the premier room is so basic, with not even a DVD player & the decor is drab & breakfast is NOT included ($48 extra each). Staff are so impersonal & rude & pool is tiny with hardly any chairs. Don't bother coming here it's a waste of time & money!",3
"Impersonal, overpriced, no breakfast included, isolated location, unfriendly staff, poor room cleaning. Good pool. Suggest you try elsewhere. Outrageous room cost. No sense of 5 star",3
It's amazing and wonderful place that couldnot miss when come to Singapore. There is the show every night. That is so magnificent about the music with the colorful light in every huge trees. So much enjoy with this show.,5
"Very good hotel in Singapore! Amazing views, it's an architectural wonder and the infinity pool on the rooftop terrace is spectacular. The Gardens by the Bay area is very beautiful and we enjoyed our day there very much. We had avery big deluxe room on the 40th floor. Good service! I highly recommend this hotel for you!",5
"The hotel design is spectacular. But it is a victim of it's own success, crowds everywhere. Huge foyer and atrium as you walk miles to the different towers a few chairs would be appreciated. Due to the size of the hotel there is no sign of any personal service.  The pool area is only for the views and taking photos, although the staff were attentive and plenty of towels available, it was not a place you would consider spending a relaxing time. I was disappointed that the pool itself closed at 8pm. We were very relieved to be given an early check in. Therefore avoiding the huge queues we noticed later in the day.",3
"excellent location, excellent views. Great view at night at the infinity pool. the buffet at the restaurant offered a lot of choices and very good. rooms were comfortable and clean. Easily accessible to the shops and attractions around.",5
"If you don't want to step foot outside for any reason while you're in Singapore, you should stay here. It's hot so I totally get the desire. It's cavernous with 3 separate towers all connected by the ground level and the rooftop where there is a spectacular infinity pool and restaurants. It's also connected to a massive mall with stupidly high end high end stores.  Oh, and there's a casino.  Some misses with the hotel - it's big so plan on hiking it to everything including breakfast. The bath products were very disappointly lower end with an unpleasant sweet smell. You're one of a gazillion guests and you can feel it.",4
"not bad to stay here,  very good staff and services. nice and clean room with good view, specially access to rooftop pool and easy access to casino.  but the negative point is cheap lobby style (look like 3 stars). don't expect too much at the lobby. and price too expensive for what it get.",4
"We stayed in this hotel on 28-29 September just to visit the infinity pool while staying in Singapore and we had high expectations based on the comments and the photos. However, it was a disappointment for us, due to below mentioned reasons.   First of all, it is a HUGE hotel, which means it is very crowded and as a guest you do not feel yourself special. As it is very crowded, imagine the pool area. At any hour of the day, the pool is full of people taking selfies constantly. It was an issue to find available deck-chairs during our stay. The pool looked much smaller than in the photos, maybe due to the crowd. We did not enjoy it at all... Given that it is a very expensive hotel and the aim of our stay was just experiencing the infinity pool, we were not satisfied.  As it is a…",2
book at there and try to get from highest floors. The view is amazing at all. The rooms are comfortable and clean. But as everyone know the best thing is the infinity pool. Go to pool at night and get the pleasure of great Singapore view.,5
"It was a fabulous way to end the trip with fantastic view at night and being in the infinity pool, SkyPark and awesome laser show. Easy access to Marina, Helix Bridge, Merlion Walk, Art Science Museum, Gardens and So many things with shopping mall connected to hotel.Nice to be there but too busy hotel",4
"We stayed at MBS for the F1 and everything about our stay here was memorable.  The welcome and check in were fast and efficient, to make it even better we had a free room upgrade to a suite ( even tho it was F1 week ) this totally blew us away as the suites are mightily impressive and we just could not believe our luck.  The whole complex is a vast expanse of shops, bars, theaters, casino and other options to suit all tastes.  Our first port of call was the Skypark and the world famous infinity pool.....it really is a WOW moment when you exit the lift to see it panoramic views across the pool and Singapore city, although very busy we managed to secure a couple of beds pool side, ordered some drinks and watched the sunset as the city came to life....whilst taking the mandatory…",5
"I have stayed at this hotel on three separate occasions now but this visit left left me disappointed. My previous stays have all been incident free and enjoyable. the staff have always been very accommodating and the room service punctual and good. However, on my latest visit the hotel failed to give me a wake up call as requested which resulted in me missing my international flight. This was  basic request request which should have been met. Reluctant to stay again.",4
"My first impression is that it is a very touristy and not a classy hotel because the lobby is teeming with people. But once I was in the safety of our room and enjoying the view then I felt that we are indeed in a luxury hotel. Other than that, the price of the stay reminded us. Lol. The only food I tried were stuff they were serving at the pool area which is always crowded. Just ok, my club sandwich could have been warmer. But nothing beats the sights from there especially on a clear day.",4
"The infinity pool, on the 57 floor, is definitely amazing. However, the room is standard and there isn´t anything to justify the high price charged.  The check in/check out is efficient but it lacks the human touch. Finally, they gave as connecting room and we had to endure with all the noises from the other room for two nights. After I went to the reception they promptly changed us. The question is: why give us a connecting room in the first place when we are a couple? Why not reserve those for family and relatives?",3
Staying here in September when the F1 race is on certainly made it a very expensive place to stay even by Singapore standards. It is really hard to justify paying the exorbitant rates even though the infinity pool is truly amazing. The views are fantastic especially at night and being in the infinity pool on the Sunday night when the actual F1 race was on and looking down on the race was an amazing experience. The whole hotel and the actual experience of being there is very reminiscent of being in a Las Vegas hotel rather than a Singapore hotel which I feel is to its detriment.  Having wanted to stay here for the last few years I am glad we have experienced MBS but there is so many other great hotels in Singapore I doubt if we will return to MBS.,3
"Luxury for sure at this hotel. Easy access to casino, botanical gardens and adjoining mall. Of course all very expensive, but that was expected. Infinity Pool was spectacular & view but considering the amount of tourists up there, overrated. Customer service good. Chocolate and cheese buffet was a lovely experience. View from room was nothing short of amazing. ",4
"This hotel is an excellent,good standard accommodation.It has excellent views and great service such as friendly staff in the reception and the buffet. In my experience I was lucky enough to stay in the presidential suite and it was marvellous even though it is abit costly. Even a normal room has astonishing views. This whole hotels is shaped as a boat on a building.The swimming pol and the higher deck is the most exciting place you should go in the world.",5
"Its a master peice in hotels,The dream hotel to stay.The view from thw 38th floor is mesmerising.Talking about food and service it exceeds the expetations and marks the higest standards in the industry.",4
"I think the best thing about this hotel isn the pool. We stayed one night just so we could try it out and it was really nice but thinkign about the price of the one room for one night, you could get a nicer hotel with friendlier, warmer staff than here. The rooms were clean and large and comfy, the bathroom was great, and the staff were friendly. However it was very busy all the time, as you would expect as it has become a tourist attraction aswell, and the pool was also full a lot of the time.  I think its great to try one or 2 nights but for the money you spend you could stay somwhere else much nicer!",4
"Great spot to sit and watch the city lights come to life. The laser show was pretty awesome, although the haze kind of ruined the impact of the light show, but still stunning and definitely worth waiting until 8pm to see it! Best view in my opinion is from The Helix Bridge looking towards Marina Bay Sands and the skyline. The southern side looked crowded from where we were so we were pretty glad we opted to stay near the bridge ",5
"We stayed here for 2 nights at the start of our honeymoon and it was fantastic from start to finish. When we checked in were on the 4th floor not too far above the foyer and the road but asked to move higher up and were promptly upgraded to a suite on the 47th floor. The room, the view and the staff were nothing short of excellent. The highlight is a trip to the SkyPark and the infinity pool. There is something surreal about watching the city lights from a swimming pool 200m above the ground at 10pm at night. Not cheap but worth every penny.",5
Russian-speaking manager Aleksandra at check-in was very helpful.   Absolute comfort within the room and in every corner of the hotel. Unforgettable show in the theatre (Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games).  Nits: Only 2 AC sockets in double room. Not enough for average number of gadgets per person.  Repair/construction works in SkyPark made access to the pool problematic from Tower 2. All restaurants and cafes at the roof shut down too early.  Summary: DO NOT book for 2 days: plan for longer stay or you will not be able to see and feel all wonders there!,5
"The view from the pool. Amazing. But it feels like the hotel is resting on its laurels when it comes to the usual Asian comfort levels available in other Singapore 4 & 5* hotels. The American management style really shows through with the lack of care and attention to what could be a superb experience.   Upsides. The Pool. That skydeck is just amazing. The infinity pool is a real treat. The rooms are large (Suites and club rooms) and well appointed.   Downsides. The finish & Public areas. From paint that has been left to run on visible steelwork & broken tiling to a lobby that's more like a noisy bus station than a luxury hotel. There's just a general lack of comfort here for the price.   The club lounge was a bit of a disappointment. Again, lovely view, but lack of comfort and…",3
"If one can afford, than this is one HTL not to be missed when in SIN... Everything about this property is above 5* growth from the arrivals to departure.... The staff are well mannered & obliging & willing to go the extra mile for any assistance required... All rooms are tastefully decorated with quite a few amenities with beautiful views of the ocean or the city... The prize possession is the Infibity Pool on the 57th floor overlooking the city, can only be visualised if one has visited it... The views are stunning & the entire layout is superbly decorated. The HTL has a high-end luxury mall attached with shops of luxury designer brands all adorned in the hugely decorated mall... The HTL also has the access to Gardens by the Bay, which is a must visit if time permits... The…",5
"I'm really not sure how to rate this monstrosity of a property so this will be a few facts that may help you decide on the length of your stay.  This is a high priced hotel and worth staying for a couple of nights but not more and only if you are trying to impress yourself or someone else. If you are looking for a comfortable bed, drive right on past. The beds lack initial quality and aren't improving with age. All of the surfaces and furniture are low for style which means lots of bending over for anyone over 5' 4"". Dresser has very little room and the mirrors are poorly placed .. as in not by an electrical outlet so you can dry your hair. It has some cool features like automatic drapes but they only opened about half of the available window view. We arrived during the…",3
"We normally stay at the Hilton on Orchard but we had seen MBS through its development so just had to stay there.  Checked in early evening so no problem. We had a 5th floor room in tower three overlooking the gardens. No problem with this location, view was good but we found that the noise from the highway was persistent.  The room was spacious and I did like the power sockets which catered to all power plugs. Take care with the bathroom floor, no shower door can lead to water on the tiles causing a slip hazard. There was black mould on the bedroom ceiling and the fridge had not been cleared of the previous customers food, for a 5 star hotel at this price that is not acceptable. There was no fresh milk, just milk powder for tea, again not acceptable at this price.  Plenty of…",2
We got the lift to the 57th floor and had a (very expensive) drink in the bar next to the infinity pool that's enough to scare years off anyone who doesn't like heights! Staff very friendly and even offered to take photos of us with Singapore views and the pool in the background. The views are incredible but the smog is very bad at the moment due to the fires in Indonesia and the photos look very grey.,5
"Everyone should stay here once, the hotel is enormous on size and experience. There are so many rooms and people, amazing views, access to a lovely shopping centre/casino - its all part of the deal.   Clearly, this is a very impressive hotel and a wonderful experience to stay here. Maybe because it was our second trip  - it did feel like it had lost some of its ""amazingness"" lustre. The changing of lifts to get to the pool (if you stay on a low floor), the security to get into and out of the pool area, the very limited menu at the pool and lines to the restaurants and check in/out. It was a bit tiresome by the end.  It is huge hotel (2500 rooms)  and with so many rooms and people these things are to be expected. My tip -   Stay once for a night or two - enjoy it for what it is.…",4
"Stayed here for 5 nights before flying to Bali. Read many reviews around long waits for check in/out. They must have sorted this as we didn't have any waits at all.  Room was on 30th facing gardens and the bay - great views.  Room was large and stylish - very pleased.  The iconic ""highest infinity pool in the world"" was fully utilised, 06.30 swims let you see the sun rise and it felt like you were swimming in the sky.  Downtown MRT is under building use Bay Front stop. For s$3.60 return,  in two stops you can be at Telak Ayer MRt which is where Lau Pa Sat is. Go the other way to Bugis , to be near the Arab Street.  If you love luxury shopping the malls under the hotel are a must.  See my review of Rise before you eat there.   Light show on city side is fantastic 20:00 hours. You…",5
"Crowded with alot of PRCs ,if u check in during weekend, it's quite happening at night ....but the rooms are very pleasant and spacious especially the washroom :))))). For those who intend to visit Singapore. ......1 night stay is good enough. ",4
" We spent one night at MBS, during the F1 race, thus the price were even more expensive... Nevertheless I would recommend this hotel. It's one Of the symbol Of Singapore, the infinity pool is just amazing with top view on Singapore skyline.There are a lot Of people, but this is expected with such a big hotel. Service + check-in is very good, staff helpful. Rooms are very comfortable with everything you need, and even the garden view is to recommend. Gardens by the bay very beautiful by day or night. I would not stay more than one day, cause Of the price, but if you are going to Singapore you should Troy it once.",5
"We stayed here for two nights. The rooms and corridors are so quiet that you feel you are the only person staying here which is very good considering there are over 2000 rooms here. Housekeeping was outstanding and room service very good. Not a thing to complain about. One of the very Best infinity pool of the world is the main attraction with big casino & best shopping mall of Singapore. Garden by the Bay is very near by, The Art & Science Museum, Singapore Eye all are near by.",5
"We arrived in the hotel in a taxi from the airport which was reasonable.  Check in took a while as it was busy but we were soon checked in and in our room.  Our room was very high up and we took the club executive option.  We had a balcony and superb views.  The rooms were lovely and large and had everything you needed.  We used the club lounge at every opportunity and made the most of it.  In fact we didn't need to eat out of the hotel because the club lounge was amazing.  The breakfast was superb, the best I have ever had.  The staff are so sweet and helpful, they remember your name, what you like and dislike, very attentive.  The afternoon tea is just indulgence and delightful.  The canapés and cocktail session was the best with food that you wouldn't find even in the best…",5
Paid almost $600 for one night and given 2 key cards and everywhere require the keycard to unlock. even going toilet. it feel like a prison unlocking door everywhere u go. a third person would costs u again $100 for a key card which is totally ridiculous. a huge hotel that got nothing to offer other then that pool. even that now access is restricted with all the stupid gates etc.,1
"If you want to see beautiful view of Singapore, this is the best choice! The pool is amazing, the breakfast is super delicious and the staff are helpful! I stayed here with my family and it's all their needs. The hotel itself has access to bayfront mrt which make us easier to travel around Singapore. There are bus stops too in front of the hotel which connect to many famous destination in Singapore. me & family love everything about this hotel.",5
We stayed her for three nights and besides being the busiest Hotel with so many people everywhere I could not fault it. The rooms and corridors are so quiet that you feel you are the only person staying here which is very good considering there are over 2000 rooms here. Housekeeping was outstanding and room service very good. Not a thing to complain about.,5
"Wanted to stay in the Marina Bay Sands because of the pool. Really liked the hotel and whilst I was in one of the less expensive rooms on the lower floors it turned out to be an advantage because of the haze. I overlooked the Marina Bay Gardens which was lovely. The hotel was very nice and the service professional and very friendly. However, personally I would not stay there again as it was far too big and it felt like a place you cannot escape easily. There are 2500 rooms, a lot of bars and restaurants, a giant casino and an adjacent shopping mall. It felt like a hotel owned by a Las Vegas chain. Even the pool was so crowded and full of people doing selfies or searching for free sun loungers. Of course I did my selfieas well but left soon afterwards. A real treat but too much…",4
"Although the digs were spacious, modern and comfortable with great views, I found the vibe to be vey pretentious. On the roof top pool it was selfie central on steroids, yuk. To top it off they hold $200 for 14 days which is a bit rich if you didn't touch the mini bar.",2
"If you want to experience Singapore's amazing view then stay here! The view from the roof top pool or from one of the roof top bars is worth seeing!!  The hotel itself is positioned in a great location with hundreds of shops and eateries directly below. The facilities are excellent, rooms are clean and staff very  My only tip is to request a higher floor room, if you don't you will be disappointed . friendly. ",5
"Have had the pleasure of staying at several nice resorts, hotels around the world.  Certainly not the most well traveled.  However, this was an amazing experience with some advice.  To stay at Marina Bay Sands is to be part of a skyline, a structure which is now so iconic it is helping define the modern day Singapore.  A fantastic location with incredible access to the Marina, to the city (Orchard) and the airport.  Surronding are the Gardens, the shopping, the nightlife and restaurants.  Amazing!  And the pool...there are almost no words to describe this incredible engineering accomplishment.    The service throughout the hotel is absolutely the very best and I was thoroughly impressed.  From the room cleaning staff to check out...top, top quality.  So why 'only above average'.…",4
"We stayed here on the last night of our three week Asian Adventure. It was definitely a fab way to end the trip.   We upgraded to a high floor, orchid club room. The view was SPECTACULAR and well worth the money.   The icing on the cake however was the pool. It is definitely an experience. We caught it on the sunset and stayed in it for an hour or so after. THe evening lights are just amazing.  We even caught the laser show on the harbour below. What an experience. I don't think you could have asked for more.   The rooms were ok - ours was big, but worn. It had a Las Vegas feel to it (large amounts of people passing in and out) however I suppose that is par for course.   The shopping area is great, the MRT is under the hotel. For a longer stay, I preferred our hotel on Pickering…",4
This is the best one when compare to all other hotels which I have lodged so far.  The casino is grand.  The restaurant just too nice.  The infinity pool in 54th floor is a signature in Singapore.  The huge shopping mall and connected to every where which is unbelievable.  A hotel must go when travel to Singapore.,5
"Stayed in a suite for a few nights, and I must say it was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in Asia.  Great views with amazing furnishings and bathrooms. Room service was on point and efficient.  Obviously priced in the high range but of course this is Singapore and it's definitely worth the money when compared to other options. The MBS complex is self-contained and has almost anything you would need including dining, nightlife and shopping so we didn't end up leaving the building the whole time we stayed.",5
"It's a giantic hotel as you need to really see it to comprehend that. For example, when you first enter to the hotel, what you see is the check-in (registration) queue is as long as a passport control queue in a busy airport. Somehow we were taken to VIP-Registration lounge, which even took more than 15 mins. waiting.   We wanted to pay the deposit cash in USD (like we do in many other hotels, where we later on pay our bill with local currency and take deposit back in USD),  which was accepted but mentioned that the return would be in Singapore Dollars only. I found it odd that I'm paying the deposit to an international hotel, and the hotel is trying to make profit out of it with their dead exchange rates. Other options are paying it in Singapore Dollars (which we didn't have…",3
"MBS is quite hard to review.  As a general overview it is an iconic & impressive building in its own right, & if you are in the city but not staying at the hotel the views from the Skydeck are awesome as long as the air quality is good. The lobby is huge, & quite imposing. We arrived by taxi & were immediately welcomed & our luggage tagged by the bellboys. The luggage tagging system is very good & is electronically matched to your name/room.  My best recommendation is to book the best you can possibly afford. We booked a grand club room & found it both huge & excellent - & it wasn't even a suite!  Club rooms or better have their own check in at Tower 1, which gets you sorted much sooner than the big queues for 'normal' check in. We found the check in staff to be friendly &…",4
"I had heard a lot about the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands and that was the principal reason why I had always wanted to stay there.   There can be no denying that the hotel is an excellent hotel. We had a lovely lovely time there and the entire stay was an experience in itself. The pool, which was my star attraction was a fun place to spend time at. Our room had a balcony and the rooms have an excellent view. One can spend hours sitting or standing in the balcony and gazing at the sea. I am uploading a picture that I took from my room's balcony.  The hotel provides a plethora of activities which can cater to people of any age group and any wishes or vices. The hotel is attached to a grand mall, a LV Showroom, a food court, has an in house disc/club, a large number of…",4
Spent 9 Nights with my Wife & 1 child at Marina Bay Sands over the school Holidays. Rooms where nothing special but nice. The Club Room was brilliant and defiantly made the stay at this Hotel. I would not stay their again unless I had use of the Club Room again. The Pool is amazing. Overall it was above my Expectations and would defiantly recommend it to others. Good location and personally I thought that the Marina Bay Sands Shopping center was the best in Singapore. Did not,5
Amazing day & night visit to MBS!! My only gripe is one cannot go & see the awesome swimming pool on the top deck of the MBS if you are not client of the hotel. Thanks.,5
"I'm a little indifferent towards this Hotel. This is an aesthetically pleasing hotel and  luxurious in its presentation.  If you enjoy mega hotels and indulgence you will love it here.  It was interesting experience to try but not my cup of tea. The infinity pool was a bit of a circus. More on that later.  We stayed for three nights in two interconnecting rooms with amazing views that were maximized by floor to ceiling windows.  The bedding, furniture, and finishes were top quality and the comfort level of the room might make you not want to leave.  The amenities were exquisite and promptly replenished when needed.  Great selection of in-room tea and coffee too(no Nescafe to be seen).    Check-in was an experience. Lots of instructions given to ensure a smooth stay.  We were at…",3
Probably one of the most luxurious hotels stays of my life. Absolutely amazing and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Singapore. Has its own casino and shopping mall attached! The infinity pool and incorporated restaurants are breathtakingly amazing! A must if your visiting Singapore. ,5
From driveway to check in was a breeze. The view from the infinity pool was breathtaking where 90% of the people are taking photo rather than swimming. The observation deck provides a great view of the city night light and garden by the bay. The room & bathroom are spacious and clean.Will definitely be back here. The price is also beyond typical hotel.,5
I went to visit this hotel. It is one of the landmarks of that great city. You can have an amazing view if you go up the building. There is also swimming pool on top if you want to relax in a water.   I really recommend visitors to take one step and visit it.,5
Stayed here for 3 days. The hotel is nice room is nice and the pool is another level and just staying for the pool is worth while but for how much you pay I would not recommend. The staff are far from helpful. The breakfast baring in mind how many guests they have is beyond basic and not much choice. If you are staying here I would only recommend for a day to use the pool. It's not worth the £300 plus a night.,4
"My husband and I had been so excited to stay here. We lasted an hour before checking out and back into the Fullerton. The service was shocking from a poor check in whereby nothing is explained to a lack of signposting leaving us wandering round aimlessly before we can even find the correct elevator. The first room we check into is dirty and a note hand written in Chinese says ""to wait for cleaning"" or something! the windows had all been left open and when Singapore is experiencing a haze issue very unhealthy. We move rooms (no apology or upgrade) and we ask for some additional complimentary water to make feeds for our baby. We are told no and they will happily send some up at $4 +. Now I'm sorry but when you're paying $1000 or so a night I expect to be given some bottles of…",1
"If there is ever a hotel that is just too big, this is it. But yet, our family couldn't get adjoining rooms (which we specifically requested at the time of booking which was confirmed). Their excuse was that the guest of one of the rooms was checking out late...  But wait for it, we couldn't even get 2 rooms on the same floor when we checked in!!!!! 3 towers full of rooms but still we couldn't get 2 rooms together???   This resulted as a major inconvenience for us for the whole duration of our stay, my husband had to share with our 1.5 year old and I had to share with our newborn. We had to run between the 2 rooms constantly as you can imagine with any young families, husband was on the 27th floor and I was on the 12th.   Another major inconvenience was that your key card…",2
"Marina bay sands is a must do in Singapore for one night to see the pool and the view. And the rooms are nice, the location good. The pool is fun, but it is not relaxing at all, because everyone is taking pictures and selfies all the time, so you can't profit of it.  The staff is very unfriendly, the restaurant on the top is not really good, the breakfast is in a way to big area and not enjoyable. The service is bad: 20 minutes waiting for Check-in, no one who takes care of the luggage at arrival.  ",2
"amazing building in singapore, the view from top is amazing and really make you amazed. the elevator is super fast. the room is clean and spacious. the house man did not speak english so hard for me to communicate. I got a nice view from my room which facing to floating football field.  one thing for sure, management should thing how to improve the hotel from inside (the people) and the outside (building) such as maintaining and developing.",5
"I spent time or visited  5 stars hotels in Europe or USA, including Las Vegas, that i adore... Dubai not yet, but next, i hope.... Well, i cannot imagine a more overwhelming experience than the infinity pool in Marina Bay Sands! For me nothing can beat this experience, not yet at least! Amazing megaconstruction, genial architectural idea, great feeling to actually be there, up there, in this amazing infinity pool, with Singapore down there....! Probably the rest, like great rooms or apartments, great service, great view, great shopping area, etc, one can experience somewhere else too, BUT NOT the infinity pool! I am grateful that i could do it!",5
"My husband and I stayed in the hotel last week and it was nice. The hotel is expensive but worth the price for a short stay. We loved the infinity pool and the restaurants there. The room was superb,I liked the bathroom alot. The restaurant Adrift was excellent and served some very good cocktails. Staff was friendly and supportive.",5
"There can be no doubt that this property has a lot going for it. I have stayed here previously and enjoyed my experience which is why I chose, once again, to try it out and, in doing so, took a friend with me who was visiting Singapore for the first time.  Physically, the property is stunning and is undoubtedly an icon of the Singapore skyline. Of course, one of the problems associated with being so big is that it lacks the warmth and personal touches of other hotels. The lobby is quite clinical and does not make for a great first impression. That having been said, our check-in experience was good with little waiting, although this no doubt had something to do with the fact that we were arriving at around 11pm.  The room was a good size with a lovely balcony overlooking the…",4
"I have read mixed reviews about Marina Bay Sands and I beg to differ the negative. I'm glad I followed my heart and booked 2 Orchid Suites in celebration of my daughter's 21st birthday. Check in was smooth as few days before my stay, I had submitted the pre-arrival planner. Upon my room arrival,  was greeted with birthday cakes, fruits and chocolates. The friendly Ms. Tze Wei (MBS Guest Relation Officer) attended to my every needs. The birthday celebration attended by friends and family was a blast. MBS night views was a stealer.

For anyone going on a budget should keep money to stay in this hotel for atleast 1 night . The hotel is like a should not miss attraction. We were lucky to get a room on 50th floor . The check in and out timings are 3.00pm and 11.00 am. There is a huge rush at 3.00 for checking but the staff handle it well. The staff at entrance will take care of your luggage so that you go for registration without your luggage . Even when in queue the staff will start the registration process . They are very courteous and explain every thing well. The room decor are top of the line . However the bathroom door doesnot have a latch. When we asked to the hotel . They said it's designed that way . It's a bit inconvinient when there is a family with children in the room . There is a fully loaded…,5
A fabulous hotel.  Large rooms.  Views of the City or Bay.  Every facility you could need.  The Skypark offers fabulous views day or night with bars to wash down what you see.  A swim in the pool is a must do whether you are a guest or not.  It is not cheap especially during an event (eg  F1 GP).  Indulge yourself just once.,5
"I have been to many hotels with spectacular views and this is by far one of the best. we were upgraded to a club room on arrival, the check in was smooth though the lobby area was busy and somewhat congested. staff were efficient and courteous. We asked for the city view overlooking the bay area, and the first thing you notice when you enter the room is the VIEW, it is a wonderful sight and from the windows you could also see the laser display in the night by 8pm i think, that further adds to beauty. the other side had the garden view overlooking Gardens on the bay, i would imagine the view there to be spectacular as well especially at night.  Everything about the hotel is great, the infinity pool, the sky park with even more amazing views, the gym and the room service are all…",5
"It's an iconic hotel I can't imagine coming to Singapore and not staying here,  at least once!! Pool does get busy, drinks and food are expensive.  We had a city view which was amazing in the evening, but the garden view looked great too as the gardens are all lit up in the evening.   Room was huge with all mod cons.  I can't say this is the best hotel or best service we've ever had, but there is nothing to complain about and it was well worth the money just to be in an infinity pool on the 57th floor staring at the Singapore skyline ( pool is open to residents only) don't forget your waterproof camera and your selfie stick !!",5
"It was expensive especially because it was a summer visit.  The cost was worth it because we had a great experience.  We spent half of the day saturday at the pool. The hotel has a photographer that takes pictures and you purchase them for a large fee.  With such a big hotel you would think the service would be lacking, it wasn't.  The pool staff was amazing, front desk, and the doormen.  Our room was big enough and well decorated with a large bathroom.  The hotel is large, but when you are in your hotel tower it seems like a regular sized hotel.",5
"My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights , we had amazing experience at the Marina, the Infinity  pool is amazing my daughter truly loved it. Great way to spend our summer vacation.  Just a few Recommendation - movie selection on TV was not great., Also please improve your shower. Room service are quick , Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast at Restaurant  is super!",4
"Eight nights at a conference and exhibition in an extraordinary location. Dinner at Sky on 57, the rooftop bar, spectacular views over the bay, the gardens by the bay, and much more.  This is an expensive location with opportunities to spend even more, so be prepared - there are cheaper locations in Singapore. However the rooms are superb, service levels are excellent, the food is very good, and it's definitely worth the visit.  The bathroom, beds and in room ambiance are very good, and the only in room downside is the frankly ridiculous wifi system which asks for constant logins and daily refreshes. Definitely the worst thing about the hotel.  A word of warning: it's a busy location. The lobby and internal thoroughfare can be like Grand Central Station, and if crowds bother…",5
"The suite that we had was very spacious, there's plenty of room for the three of us. The bed was really comfortable. The highlight of our stay was the pool at the skypark. Towel are always ready for you and you can even order some cocktaill while sitting on the poolside. The overall experience is really great. I might come back if i ever get back to Singapore.",5
"If you're the kinds who eyes luxury hotels during your stay in Singapore, you should highly consider Marina Bay Sands as one of your top choices. Stands true to being a 5 star hotel, amazing breakfast spread, spacious rooms, quick room service, good food! Their infinity pool on the 57th floor deserves a special mention .. you should hit the pool 2 hrs before sunset & hang around till around 7:30-8pm. Its mostly full & finding a good seat can be task..  The casino is also good .. they have a connected mall inside for luxury brand shopping..   Make sure you look up for a good room in advance.. one with their garden facing view..",5
"We had a very nice room on the 51st floor overlooking the city. The bed was lovely and comfortable with good quality linen. The bathroom was very dangerous when wet! I did the splits coming out of the shower so ended up putting the towels on the floor so we didn't slip over. My real bug bear was the tea/coffe situation... 2 cheap sachets of instant coffee and 1 of each different flavoured tea bags, bizzare choices for a 5star hotel but worse was the expectation that it is acceptable to put coffee mate in tea! Why was there no fresh milk supplied? Very disappointed after all our room only cost $750 for 1 night!! Unfortunately our view was very hazy due to the illegal Sumatra fires and we had a very quick swim in the fantastic infinity pool but our eyes were smarting and we were…",3
"In truth we only stayed here initially to get access to the skylark, and the infinity pool in particular. I suppose it didn't disappoint, but the pool area was consistently busy even late at night as people were getting night shots from the pool. However, I have to say thanks to the hotel staff who upgraded the room for us, to make our last night on honeymoon special. The view from the room was amazing, with a view across the marina. We didn't have breakfast included, what there are coffee shops across the road in the Shoppes centre. There are also food court outlets there, if you didn't want tho eat in the high end restaurants.",4
"Well this hotel was amazing ! Me and my friends only stayed here one night but will definitely be returning here. The hotel is rather large so you do feel quite small in comparison to all the people staying there. The hotel is easily reached by the MRT , you have to walk through a hall of designer malls to get to the hotel. Reception isn't clearly marked out. The room we were put in was fantastic , looking straight onto the gardens.   The room was amazing , so big and even had usb chargers. Only thing I didn't appreciate is that the bathroom didn't have a lock. We were on the 40th floor. I believe there are 57 rooms in total   We ordered room service and they were quick to deliver and the food was amazing.  ***the infinity pool**** absolutely makes this hotel, it is unreal. A…",4
Such a wonderful property and service . Enjoyed each and every moment in our stay . Unfortunately TV was not working as the cable was not properly plugged . Have seen some staff accessing the FOH elevators while their at duty . But we loved the place and meals . Wanna come back again . Such a nice property on earth. ,5
"Cost is $23 per per and they try to sell you a tacky photo for $50 but the view is outstanding even with the haze from other parts of Asia that is currently covering Singapore.   56 storeys up, what a view.   Perhaps next time stay here and try the infinity pool",4
"Along with the Burj Al Arab this is a hotel ""wonder of the world"" and a must try even if just for one night to expereince the iconic roof top pool.. that's what it's all about. A Vegas style hotel with shopping mall in the basement all pretty good value too! ",4
"Everything about it is so professional and high classed, but still an extremely fun experience. There will be a lot of business goers but mainly just fun adults enjoying their time. Everything from Gardens By the By through to Marina Bay Sands, and then to the Shoppes is so well maintained and clean it is a completely different world. With great views day and night, a fun pool where no one actually goes there to swim (more for photography), this hotel is filled with buzzing and excited guests, experiencing a rare but uncontrollable bubbly feeling right at the peak of Singapore's most famous piece of architecture.   Everything from service staff to sleep quality is tops.  One thing is that dining options are limited to high class and expensive foods which are quite good, however,…",5
"what a fantastic hotel. efficient staff, great rooms, brilliant location. amazing views. will defiantly stay here again when i return to this amazing city. great tube links to the hotel as well and shopping on your doorstep.",4
"Stayed here with my wife and 2 young daughters 4/5yrs old.   Positives: ------------- Nice sized room on 1576, with fold out sofa, girls loved it. Complementary access to sky bar and pool on level 57. Nice and close to the general lobby and small lift transfer to get to the 22nd floor to transfer lifts to 57th floor.   They greeted us well on arrival, although it would have been nice to check in between12-3pm, but we had to wait to 3pm.  Check out time however is 12pm, making up for late checkin time.  Breakfast in the first restaurant downstairs was good value ~$40 per head and from memory our two girls are free and as many barista coffee as you could drink.   Most of the restaurants in the mall seem to charge back to the hotel room.  Good view.   Negatives: --------------  We…",3
Stayed here for two nights and were given a balcony room overlooking the gardens by the bay. We were a group of four and the room was amazing - very spacious. When planning this trip I was expecting that we would all be put into one small room however our room was huge and had two bathrooms including a bath and make up table. We also had a balcony which was also really big and a huge sitting area where we could look over the gardens. The view from the top is amazing however the pool can be slightly crowded at times - but in saying that we were always able to get a banana chair quite easily.,5
"The hotel and staff were excellent. We booked for premier room but when they found it was our anniversary they upgraded our room to orchid suite room with a great city view plus a complimentary anniversary cake! THANK YOU!  The hotel property was modern & beautiful. The infinity swimming pool on top of the hotel building was amazing and the view was spectacular. The buffet breakfast at Rise was superb with many selection of food. The location of the hotel was convenient, very close to the mall, restaurants and local attractions. Thank you MBS for making our wedding anniversary a memorable experience!",5
"Upon arrival, it was first class, check in was seamless. My companion and I were waiting to check in, a customer service officer took us over to the VIP check in. I asked could we have a nice room with a view, (we booked a standard room) not expecting to be upgraded to a suite. Our room was (city side) 53rd level, Tower 3.  The room was huge, the view was amazing, although the view would be good from either level. The Sky deck was totally unbelievable.  Location was very good, link to the MTR, ample shopping. Everything was first class. The Sky deck was outstanding.  Will be returning in the near future.",5
"The hotel is massive and has a big multi level shopping mall connected to it. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. The highlight is the roof top terrace and pool, stunning location and views. This is an expensive hotel so one would expect the best service and quality. Mostly this is the case but there are a few issues. We received turn down service only once out of four nights, we had to ask for the room to be serviced after being out all day with the service request light on. Some areas are dirty and mouldy, not what you would expect from such a prestigious hotel. Some of the seats in the breakfast restaurant are very stained, they look terrible. Overall the experience was very good but there can be a lot of improvement, considering the cost.",4
Marina Bay is a great place in Singepore with the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. You can go to the top floor for free to have a great view of Singepore. You can pay entrance to use their pool and enjoy the sunset with a cocktail while swimming.,5
"Wonderful hotel with very comfortable rooms and stunning architecture. Beautifully designed building but it loses a star for having no heart, no management giving you a feeling of being a special guest, no lounge area, no comfy sofas in the lobby to sit and  enjoy a cup of tea or a gin and tonic and watch people go by. The main bar is separated from the lobby on a mezzanine level. I found myself going straight up to my room instead.  We enjoyed our stay overall but have felt more welcome in other grander hotels.  Good points   Room comfort Amazing bathroom with masses of counter top space and a huge walk in shower.  Balcony to dry your wet clothes (it rains, there's a pool and we were there for a week) Quick room service Excellent breakfast in room Plenty of lifts (you need to…",4

"If you are looking for a good quality hotel, Marina Bay has it all.  Easy access via tube/train/taxis. With so many interesting places to look at around the Bay you will want to stay longer than planned!",5
"Very good hotel,Good spacious rooms,excellent rooftop pool and Night club is there at the top floor which is quiet good. Hotel and city view from top floor looks really beautiful at night. Must see & stay property in singapore.",5
this is the hotel where everyone wish to stay just for a night. this hotel is the heart of singapore. it has in build metro station. it has a pool on the roof top and an observation deck on 57th floor. ,5
"Family stayed for one night in two rooms.  Rooms were both spacious, with nice bathroom amenities.  One room had an ordinary view overlooking the shopping centre, while the other had a fantastic view of the Gardens by Bay. It would be worth asking for a room with a view of at the Gardens - it was spectacular at night. Check-in counter was huge and well staffed, making check-in quick and efficient. Horizon pool was awesome, even though unfortunately during our stay thick smoke was blanketing the city because of fires in Indonesia. We ate in the shopping centre that adjoins the hotel, which was good and more reasonably priced.",5
"This is an enormous hotel! - And unfortunately they are poorly equipped at the check in  desks to cater for such crowds of people. We arrived late in the evening (it was quiet at this time) but we still had to queue for 20 mins to check in. Once checked in no-one offered to help with taking our bags to the room. Basic information was not relayed to us either - once we got to our room we had to phone down to ask where is breakfast served? What time is breakfast?   Rooms face either the bay or the city.  We went for a bay view room, which had stunning views across the ""Gardens by the Bay."" The room itself was average - a decent size - but it had a faint mildew whiff to it.  The best thing about this Hotel is the Rooftop Pool! It has stunning views across the city. Due to the music…",3
"The rooms are spacious & the amenities are in good condition. Nice view of the city skyline especially during the night. At day time, hotel guests can travel to the top floor to take a peek of the 360 view of Singapore CBD if you move 1 floor higher than where the infinity swimming pool is located. Overall a modern & luxury stay.",5
"Hotel location: 20-25 min can ride from the Changi airport and located in Marina south. Taxi fare will be around 25 dollars.  Hotel access : there are three towers and all are easily accessible, if you don't know which tower you are in ( unless it's stated in your booking) it's a short stroll to each towers.  Hotel staff : excellent staff, upon arrival greeted with a warm smile and all the staff around the hotel were very pleasant. Pool bar staff was very busy and they did their best to get the menu orders as quickly as possible.  Check in process : when we arrive it was a very busy time in the hotel and even though we waited for a little while, reception was quick enough to get us in to a room.   Hotel room : we stayed at premier room with city views (see photos) on the 43rd…",5
3 of us only stayed for a night and booked a family room with consist of a queen bed and 2 x single beds. Quite pricey as expected but the entry to the infinity pool made it worth while. The view from the pool deck especially at night is unreal.,5
"We had a room in Tower Three on 50th floor. Great views over the bay front gardens. The room facilities were excellent and the room a good size for a city centre location but the room lacked character and for me, overall, the hotel felt like an impersonal cash generating machine! We were there at a very busy time because of the Grand Prix and the room rate was very expensive. I would say that generally services in the hotel worked ok but like a machine, no personal touches.  The breakfast selection however, was excellent. Although the exterior of the hotel is very modern and exciting our room was very classic. Could have been in any good hotel anywhere in the world. Somewhat surprisingly there were no real touch of luxury but the bed was very comfortable. One major concern for…",4
"LOVED, LOVED LOVED this hotel. Saying the pool is spectacular is an understatement and although it is very busy I still feel it is worth the experience. Great location for shopping and walking to nearby attractions like the cloud forest. Wouldn't hesitate to go back!",5
"Stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend in one of the premier rooms. When you stay in a 5 star hotel you always expect a lot, and I'm usually disappointed, but not here. You pay for luxury and you get luxury!   Our room was amazing. HUGE bathroom with large free standing bath and spacious shower. The coffee in the room was really good, but the mini bar was super expensive (14 dollars for a can of tiger?!) so we bought our own from 7/11! The view over the gardens was lovely. We were on the 44th floor and had no complaints what so ever.   The pool is amazing, obviously one highlight of staying here. It wasn't overtly packed like a lot of people have mentioned, and there were plenty of times where we were the only people in one section of the pool (it was the F1 weekend so I…",5
Wonderful rooftop pool. Nice room with balcony. Modern hotel.Close to all amenities. Walking distance to great attractions. Great walk around Marina Bay. Lacks some of the old world charm and magic that some other established hotels possess.,5
"Great hotel and location. Very pricey area but that is expected since we were there during Grand Prix weekend. My only complaint is that the pool was way too busy with people putting towels down on chairs even though not being anywhere near the pool. Other then that, this hotel is great. I suggest getting a room on the 34th floor or higher to avoid having to change elevators to get to the pool.",5
"This is a 5 star gig, but felt like a 2-star guest. A really impersonal experience: the rooms are good, clean, fresh - everything you would come to expect from a big name hotel. But was just not feeling it, for my first ever staycation in Singapore. Had a couple of teething problems: the headboard light wouldn't switch off, and no engineer came to fix. The cleaning staff do not speak English, so difficult to communicate with them. We got locked out of our room, despite the late check out. The 'spectacular' pool (which it is) was ruined by drunken revellers from C'est La Vie - 'bombing' across the barriers with wine glasses in hand. Terrifying to watch. There were small kids were in the no-kids zone (not policed). A really average experience, also marred by the extraneous…",2

From the time we were dropped at the entrance we were welcomed by the most smiling face bell boys who helped us to deliver the bag to our assigned room. The reception at the lobby three was absolutely hassle free. The checking process was as smooth and professionally handled by the staff and especially i would like to recommend Mr Bryan Cheong the duty manager, what an gentleman, Must say a true asset for the institution.

"We want to say very very thank you to Geraldine! We stayed just one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary and Geraldine made it all the more special. The hotel is unique in its kind, the infinity pool is less crowded in the early morning and at lunchtime. Thank you for the great experience.",5
This place is unique in that Marina Bay Sands has a high end Mall an amazing hotel with a swimming pool on the 57th floor. Excellent plants and so on.,5
"This is the new icon / landmark for Singapore and a great location. The hotel is stunning as a view and even more so when you head in. There is plenty for everyone to do and enjoy, from the gardens, to the pool and restaurants.",4
"This is a great place to visit even quickly if you have a 5 hour layover at the airport. There are shuttles that will run you there or taxis. It's very convenient and well worth it. Go to the top to have a drink and look around. Drinks are expensive of course, but go for the sangria pitcher and share with your friends. Beautiful views, and afterward you can go to the tree forest just below connected by bridge. Two great tourist attractions in a few hours. Well worth it!",5
"stayed at the 52nd floor presidential suite , a luxurious and sprawling one with a wide view of the city skyline and river. the iconic hotel has a museum ,mall , casino , and the skypool.",5
"This was a bit of a treat. We had 3 nights in a club room. Huge room with everything we needed including a comfy sofa to sit on and a beautiful bath. If we did want to let fresh air in (not that the air feels that fresh in Singapore!) the huge balcony doors did the trick. We were on level 6 which did mean that there was quite a bit of road noise but the bed was so comfy the noise soon retreated into the distance. Loved being able to go up to level 55 for our included breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail hour. The staff were lovely, remembered our names and coffee order!",5
"Nice room,nice service,nice view,nice pool, It's perfection!!!(also nice price,but its worth it after all) Located at the center of downtown,u can reach it absolutely easily. Hope i can be there again w/ my husband for our honeymoon next year ;P",5
"It was always a dream to one day stay at Marina Bay Sands and we weren't disappointed at all, the rooms are amazing from the wow moment of walking in your room the first time to having your blinds automatically open to show he amazing views, to the size of the rooms and how luxury they are. This resort is amazing, the skypool is unbelievable an experience I will never forget. We stayed on the 39th floor with a city/bay view and it was WOW my only disadvantage I would say about the location is everything around you is so expensive in regards to shopping and restaurants. We will be back for sure. ",5
Stay in the Club Room or above and everything about this place is exceptional. This was a 'take off the bucket list experience' and we were in an Orchid Suite. It is now back on the 'bucket list' and we WILL be going back.,5
"My wife and I went to this F&B outlet with friends. It is located on the higher floors of the Marina Bay sands building and as such has fantastic views of the Singapore sky line plus also the bay with the assortment of ships. The food items are cheese and chocolate plus high quality coffee, so its not place you go for dinner and expecting a steak! What it is a amazing place to catch up with good friends, admire the views and enjoy a great arrangement of cheese, followed up by an assortment of chocolate that even had my chocolate fanatic wife in a frenzy!     Highly recommended as a must do to anyone visiting Singapore!",5
We preferred to stay at this hotel as a honeymoon couple because of the famous infinity pool. Hotel is clean and view from rooms is great but: 1) pool is really really crowded - not peaceful as in pictures. We did not swim. 2) we felt like entering a business centre not a hotel. Nothing is personal does not feel like a hotel. 3) check out time is 11am even with late check out it is 12.,3
"Stayed here for a week. 47th floor, tower 2. Great view over looking the city and the bay. Rooms are well presented, and offer everything you'll need....5 star. Hotel seemed to be very busy and full and yet every staff member encountered are friendly, helpful and very professional.  Highly recommend staying here. ",5
"This hotel has become as iconic for Singapore as Raffles, but it couldn't be more different.  This is ultimate glitz.  The staff are great, friendly and helpful, but the sheer volume of the place works against them.  We stayed in a club room with a view of the Marina Bay and city.  It could not be more spectacular, worth the visit all by itself even if nothing else worked.  But for the most part, it all does work, just not as slick as it could be.  An exception is the Club Lounge.  It's been moved down from the roof to make way for a new restaurant.  The offerings throughout the day are wonderful, and the staff makes it something special.  However, it is set up more as a restaurant, and not so much as a lounge.",4
"Our room was amazing! The moment we walked through the door, the curtains automatically opened and showed us our amazing view on the Gardens by the Bay. The room was large and the bed was nice. The Infinity Pool met my expectations but around 7PM it was freezing cold, but less crowded than in the afternoon. You also have a great view on the city lights of Singapore. The gym at the 55th is also worth the visit; lots of good equipments but I expected it to be bigger. Overall, anyone that visits the MBS, should stay at least one night.",5
"The hotel, the pool, the views, everything is amazing. I would recommend to add the extra for a club or grand club room because the breakfast on the 57th floor, plus the afternoon tea and evening cocktail hour are a great investment.",5
"Stayed here for two nights in September.  Rooms get four out of five and the pool gets five out of five.  Service in the bars and restaurants is also great. However general guest services is really poor. For example when we stayed there was an issue when my guest account was blocked. Apparently we had been enjoying ourselves too much and the hotel wanted a down payment for the account to be made in person at front desk.  First time that has happened in a life time of travelling, and nobody seemed to deal with my follow up complaint on this.  If you visit Singapore, stay one night for the pool access as this is for guests only but stay elsewhere for a better experience. ",3
"The room was beautiful but the overall service and experience was less than acceptable. For a premium hotel, there needs to be some serious work done on training staff in the essential skills of customer service. I would be unlikely to stay here again or recommend to anyone",2
"This is a hotel complex that has it all under one roof - hotel, good restaurants, casino...(I'm not a fan of the type of crowds this draws in).  So you either love it of hate, this ain't no romenantic boutique or historical hotel,  if you know what I mean.    But worth a visit once.  My biggest gripe is that you cant reserve the city view rooms.  Their room types are mixed city and container port views, so its a 50/50 change you get the right view. Same price...only decided at check in.  maybe thats changed now, but you better check to avoid dissapointment.  Pool now well known and now a destination for tourists!  Yes its worth a dip in the night when its quieter and all the day trippers have left...",4
"When visiting Singapore you must stay here! The infinity pool on the 57th floor is amaaazing and the only way to swim there will be staying at the hotel!  The food market, the shops, the rooms, the casino, everything will make your visit to Singapore a memorable one! Friendly staff and luxury 5 star service.",5
Its really comfortable and hospitable as it offers a luxorious touch to its hotel rooms . The hotel lobby is exquisite and really spacious to accomodate for all of the tourists. The food is top of the class and also offers a variety of cuisines to choose from. Would stay again next year if possible !! ,5
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 days after a cruise. On approaching we were in awe it looked spectacular. Stepping inside it is absolutely huge.  Check in took quite a long time but the staff were very pleasant.  We had 3 rooms between our party.The rooms were huge and were very well appointed. They even had electric curtains which automatically opened and closed with your door key. We were on a high floor and had spectacular views over the gardens and the city. The city views give you the chance to watch the light show from your room.  We didn't use the hotel restaurants as we thought they were overly expensive, but beware you are in an expensive part of town.  We couldn't wait to use the hotel pool but unfortunately were left a little deflated. It is extremely busy and people…",4
"Its expensive, don't get me wrong....around $20 USD, but TOTALLY worth it.  If you get up there at the right time, they do a light and sound show of the ""botanical gardens"" below that is great to watch.  Just go up for the view....trust me.",4
"We stayed at MBS for 2 nights recently and it was absolutely amazing! From the smooth check-in process, (where they were kind enough to let us check in early as we had 2 young children with us) to the sensational service from all staff (certainly not understaffed at this hotel!) to the breathtaking infinity pool on the rooftop, and the restaurants. We can't fault one thing. The rooms are very spacious and beautiful, the views are priceless and the service across the whole hotel is impeccable. We had breakfast at the Rise restaurant on the ground floor, which was a buffet, there was heaaaaaps to choose from, the only thing that wasn't amazing was the coffee? The following day we had breakfast at the rooftop restaurant Sky on 57, that was sensational! it was a semi-buffet and we…",5
"We stayed on floor 42, the first thing i remember is the electric curtains opening to the amazing view of Singapore bay. I have been up and stayed in many skyscrapers around the world, but this is the closest you get to that utopian idea of architecture. It does totally shut you off to the rest of the world, mainly because it takes so long to get out of there especially if you go through the mall, but also of course the sky garden. We had the largest selection of food at a buffet I have ever had, and the quality was incredible considering the choice.",5
"The hotel looks great, very clean and comfortable, nice personnel, willing to help you at every moment, the room is very modern, bathroom great and  the infinity pool is the cherry from the top. I wish I can come back here as soon as I can, there are still plenty of things to do here that I didn't get the chance.",5
"Airport pick up,in room check-in,room nice,hotel PERFECT location  to many restaurants,shopping,museums,all walking distance to hotel !!!! But the very best thing was gorgeous rooftop pool !!! Xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx.    Xxx.",5
"Staying at the MBS was an amazing experience. From the relaxing rooftop infinity pool, to the 5 star quality room, 10/10 service it was an experience I will never forget.  There is nothing that could have made my stay at the MBS any more enjoyable. I will definitely be coming back!",5
"This place was chosen purely for the pool but this was probably the biggest disappointment. Sure it is pretty spectacular, engineering wise. But unless you like feeling like you are packed into a sardine can good luck swimming. Room was nice, bathroom huge. Shopping amazing (if you are a millionaire) but I think I'd rather stay at a more boutique style hotel than something so commercialised. If you are a drinker, which I'm not (cough cough) many restaurants with many different cocktails to drink through. All in all a lovely place but I'm sure singapore has more to offer.",4
Arrival 1040pm. No doorman or bellman available to welcome or assist with luggage at porte corchere taxi drop off.  Had to pull open the heavy doors to get in. Lobby was packed.  Check in was fast. The ladies at check in desk were abrupt and rude to guests making enquiry about checking out and taxi booking to airport.  I was taken aback.   Room Overall comfortable. Balcony was stained and not clean... there were some dried leaves on the floor.  Air cond was making noise but quickly fixed after making a call to the service desk. Lady at service desk and the engineer who fixed the air cond were very nice.  Special mention to the daily housekeeping agent. Good job!  Breakfast  Plenty of choices. Staff were very attentive  and able to provide personalized service on the very next…,3
"The outlook of hotel is one of the icon of Singapore. However, the rooms are very ordinary. No effort has been put in to properly maintain the rooms. It is more like a business bed & breakfast hotel. You do not feel relaxed and on vacation while staying there unless you only need a bed after your business meetings or after spending a long time in the casino. The plus side is that it is very accessible to town and there are many malls nearby.",3
"We stayed here at MBS for my husbands birthday , the rooms are spacious , breakfast is wonderful. But Like everyone is aware the highligt is the swimming pool. The only negative I found was the lobby area as you do not expect a crowded common passage for a 5 star accomodation. One time recommended",4
"I was lucky to spend a week here for business. The hotel is great, rooms are spacious and offer fantastic views over the Singapore skyline or the gardens and ocean, both amazing. The highlight of the hotel is the infinity pool on the roof, you're way up, swimming and relaxing with the Singapore skyline as a background - jawdropping, really. Great gym with same view as well with superstaff.",5
"We stayed in the orchid suite for 2 nights. Great view from the room over gardens by the bay and the sea. The room looks good but is lacking on certain basics such as a place to plug in the hairdryer where you will be able see the mirror for styling purposes and sufficient hangers. In addition, for the amount charged per night, I wish the hotel could have at least given me a pillow case in good order. The one I had had several holes in it. Time to change the bed linen?   A note to mothers who are breastfeeding and may need to express and store your milk - you will have to pay for rental of a mini-fridge. The cost is nominal at $10. The in room mini-fridge can't be emptied as it will auto-charge the items removed to your room bill.  The service is business-like and lacks warmth…",3
"I had a room on the 49th floor city view. The view was of course breathtaking, the room was very big with two doublesize beds. The infinity pool on floor 57 as well as the bar and the exploration deck were the pick of the vacation.",5
"The main attraction is the infinity pool at the top of the hotel. It looks like a waterfall in 200m height with the city skyline as view. It has extreme opening hours from 6am to 11pm everyday. The view is stunning on the day and in the night. There is a towel concierge for new towels all the time. The pool is 150m long and there is an adult section without kids. There is additional a warm whirlpool. When I was staying there, there it was not crowded and there were no waiting times and very friendly staff. The prices of the drinks (served to your seat) are typical for such hotels (20SP$ for a coctail).  Beside the pool, there is free a gym with great view which even opens at 5am (and closes at 11pm) with hot pool, sauna and hamman.   My room was large with a great city view and…",5
"1-star only is a harsh judgment. But the point is to attract your attention. View is magnificent and service is near perfect (we had a Club formula: waiters are just super good). These are the only good points. For the rest: it's a touristic industry. A Disney land (you'd pay 500€/night). Charmless international hotel. Getting a bit old anyway already due to intensive use I guess. You hear your neighboors receiving SMS, spitting and pissing. Swimming pool is like a lunapark. I'd rather say selfie-swimming pool. Impossible to find a couple of seats due to over-affluence. In fact we didn't even get in. Not fun to fight for a spot. You present your access card for the lift, the access to the pool, the food, well... Disneyland. Almost 3k rooms. It had to be an industry. we could…",1
We got in early and was just planning to leave our bags but the front desk guy cheerfully announced that a room was ready for us. That set the tone for our stay in this magnificent hotel. My only issue is the buffet breakfast. It was kinda chaotic out there which is not aligned to our overall experience of the hotel.,4
Nice place. Nice room. Awesome swimming pool... I loved it... I will be back.. Promise. It s the best of Singapore i ever know. This trip is unbelievable.. And for the breakfast is really good. Many kinds of food. I hope this comment can give a reason for you to visit Marina Bay Sands.,5
"What a hotel! Stayed in a club room on the 47th floor Tower 2 with a view over the Gardens by the Bay . Beautiful room - huge bathroom with separate shower and separate  toilet room- magnificent big bath. The bed and linen were heaven to sleep in.  Club room provided full American breakfast, delicious afternoon tea and drinks in the evening (2 hours of drinks and nibbles so no need for dinner)  The infinity pool is great very crowded but there is an adults only section for those that don't like having ankle biters splashing around them. Good bar service at the pool but expensive. As a hotel guest you receive access to the Sky walk which gives expansive views over Singapore. You also receive a discount at the Art science museum. A short walk through the hotel to the Gardens by…",5
"We loved our stay and our room was wonderful apart from the toilet getting blocked! But it was fixed straight away. We stayed on the 42nd floor with views of Gardens by the Bay from our balcony, stunning. Breakfast was included daily at The Rise restaurant which was an amazing buffet. We also treated ourselves to dinner there on a Tuesday which was Seafood night and had enormous oysters which my husband- an oyster fan said were the best he tasted. A stay at Marina Bay Sands is a holiday in itself with a casino and the most fabulous shopping malls! The staff at the hotel are so friendly and ready to assist when needed. You also get access to the Sky Infinity Pool- breathtaking! Go on treat yourselves!",5
"One of the must visit hotel in Singapore. The hotel fully lived up to its brand and repetition. We were on a family holiday trip there and booked a Club Room with a Kings size bed. We have 2 small children and the reception upon confirming our number of guest upgraded us to the executive floor where she said they can arrange an soft bed for the children. We were absolutely delighted! Overall the hotel service are great at lobby and on Club floor. The view is magnificent on both side wether you are looking at city view or garden view at the Garden by the Bay. The world famous infinity pool is a must visit, if on a clear day, the view is absolutely fantastic! Food in restaurant and Club floor very good selection. Only the free tea buffet for Club floor member is a bit…",5
"We had Breath taking views of the sky gardens from our room on the 4th floor,  the hotel was obviously very nice and clean, u dnt even need to go out when ur staying here..  The place has everything, the hotel is connected with a very beautiful mall called the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Also connected to the hotel, is an amazing theatre and a museum. And then there's the Skypark observation deck.    So do request a higher floor. And it should all be great",4
"Staying at Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one my dreams which has come true and I believe that is of other visitors worldwide. The hotel provides you with what you wish when stay in a hotel. Around the hotels you could also find all things, from shopping center to culinary sites as well as amusement and casino. When you are to come to Singapore, I bet you should try to stay at MBS.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is adjacent to world class  Marina Bay Gardens. The hotel with roof top pool overlooking the high rise of Singapore, is 3 towers of luxury. Large rooms overlook either the city or bay, huge reception/restaurant mall to luxuriate in air conditioned luxury, gorgeous roof top infinity pool. Marina Bay Sands has a walkway direct to the Gardens where there is a platform to view the nightly light show. No taxis needed.",5
"Stayed with friends for 3 days 2 nights. Fantastic view and service by staff. The infinity pool, obviously is one that stands out as a plus for the stay. Shouldn't miss it. Pricey, but well worth it. If one is looking for indulgence and aome self pampering, this place, is perfect for it.",5
"We recently stayed here when we were lucky enough to have a holiday in Singapore (my first time!!). The lifts and hallways were looking a bit banged around but I guess that's to be expected as the occupancy rate is very high indeed. The service we received was second-to-none from the moment we arrived (door held open by and business card given by one the very lovely door man on duty), checked in (we were early but received a text as soon as our room was ready), asked for information at the concierge desk and checked out. The room was very nicely appointed and I loved the way the curtains opened to reveal the amazing view when we put our door key into the slot. We had chosen a room with a garden view which was cheaper than the city view but I would thoroughly recommend doing that…",4
"This is definitely a luxury hotel. It has everything in it from the fabulous rooms, fitness center, spa, restaurants, shops, casino, park, sky bar and my favorite infinity pool. This is a hotel like no other. It has reasonable price if you compare it to other hotels in Singapore. You will get a great view of the city day and night. It is very accessible to wherever you wanna go in Singapore. I love the 8pm light show of the hotel that is best viewed from one Fullerton side. The infinity pool will make you feel that you're on top of everything even if the building isn't the tallest in the city. I like the fact that the water isn't very deep for Asian like me. The room is spacious with a great view of the botanical garden. The bed is nothing but comfy. Looking forward to my next…",5
"Have a very pleasant stay. Friendly,helpful and poise front office staff. Clean and elegantly setup room. The Infinity Pool meets the expectation though the air quality in the Casino can be further improved. Will definitely recommend and return for stay in future.",5
Superb views from this new iconic hotel - go to bar for a drink - restaurant extremely expensive - £300 for 2 courses for 2 adults and 2 kids and not particularly nice,4
"The hotel is a masterpeice of architecture and technology , especially the Sky Park & the Infinity Pool at 56th floor .  I would suggest a better organization especially in the reception department especially during check-in & out which looks very chaotic and very rushed without that care and that warm welcome typical of 5-star luxury  Instead the front desk staff seemed very cold and inaccurate in giving all directions of a hotel so big Also there were renovations going on Sky Park which made it very uncomfortable being in the pool",4
"i have tried at least 6 different types of rooms ranging from the very basic to the likes of the Orchid Suite. The pool, although situated at 57th flr may seemingly be breath taking is perpetually packed. many occasions I couldnt even get a place to get a tan. The staff performance overall has dropped. unless you are planning to splurge at the casino or the shoppes at the bay, there are other alternatives and definitely not so costly.",4
My wife and I stayed here for two nights in August. What a nice hotel and the Infinity Pool is amazing!!! The Skypark views over Singapore are wonderful! Although our room was on a low level (2nd Floor) and only had views of palm trees. All the staff are very helpful and friendly and the hotel is a sight to be seen inside and out.......,5
"Could not recommend this hotel more, from check in with Cheryl V who immediately acknowledged it was our honeymoon and upgraded us comp to a Suite  which was out of this world with views of the Singapore skyline on one side and the gardens by the bay on the other side, The room was very nice and bathroom huge. Everyone was very polite and helpful, the swimming pool was incredible and location not too bad as well, mall attached, mrt attached, taxis easy to come by and relatively cheap, bars in reach and restaurants plentyful",5
"Marina Bay Sands gave us a great start to our honeymoon when they upgraded us for free to a deluxe suite on the 42nd floor with amazing views over the sea and the Sky Garden. The infinity pool with is breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline is almost indescribably and the hotel itself, the huge shopping center next to it and the extravagance and size of it all is something to be experienced.",5
"This has to be the best swimming pool in the world. Music by the pool can improve. adult pool is separated; that's a good thing. Hotel rooms are above average ad very quiet, you cant hear anything next door or hallway. We stayed at 33rd floor facing the garden.  The good thing about this hotel is you have 3 breakfast places to choose from; well 4 if you have the club access. Great service all over the property. Perfect hotel if you are in Singapore to party with a big group.",4
"Marina Bay Sands is truly an architectural and engineering beauty. We fell in love with the building and infinity pool a few years ago and have wanted to stay at the hotel ever since. The infinity pool is as amazing as the pictures, and the rooms have wonderful views of CBD and the marina. We can't find a fault with the room, which is tastefully decorated and colour-coordinated. The bed is comfortable, and there is very good insulation; we slept like babies. The bathroom is beautiful and private. We would definitely stay at the hotel again the next time we're in Singapore.  The only downside is the quality of service, which is definitely not 5-star. The check-in was pretty slow but wasn't unbearable. The most unacceptable part of our stay was that we had to pay cover to visit…",4
"I choose this hotel as we wanted a stopover to relax and read by a nice pool. It was so busy with hundreds of people wanting to take photos and not enough sun lounges and too many restaurants. The lifts to and from were always full and sometimes had to wait. We visited once and then decided to give it a miss as it was too stressy. Check in, we also had to wait but had a lovely friendly reception. Our room was fine with all things that we expected for this price. Check out was quick and also very friendly staff. Be careful as the mini bar has a sensor when you pick up a drink. ( but it is not a problem to get it taken off your bill) It was good to see but wouldn't stay again.",3
"While this hotel stretched our finances, it was well worth it. From the magnificent views from our Premier room through to an amazing roof top infinity pool, this place had it all. Without a doubt five star throughout. We wanted to spoil ourselves with something special and we weren't disappointed. Additionally, the location in proximity to the Night Gardens and the river really topped it off. Very highly recommended if you can spare those extra dollars",5
"Staying here was superb, the hotel suite was fantastic and the building is amazing. The construction that went into this thing is pretty impressive. Check in was fast as there's a separate section for suites and club rooms. There are a lot of restaurants to choose from to eat in this iconic venue, however only the two on the top level actually have a view of any kind. The more time I spent in Singapore the more I realized outdoors and views are rare compared home.  The hotel for it's size did feel very full, and you do have to book for everything and wait for service and elevators to go anywhere. It's so big I was on hold to get to house keeping for over 5 mins, definitely a first for that. Club access includes complimentary afternoon tea (cookies, and tea/coffee), evening…",4
"The location is great, with a complex of restaurant, shopping mall and casino. The room is ok but the bed is comfortable. You might have to wait for a long line to check-in and check-out. The best part is the infinity pool which only allowed for hotel guests.",4
"Fantastic hotel, the only drawback is the anmount of people checking in and out. The rooms are big and clean. The breakfast is amazing, you get everything from all countries. The swimmingpool at the roof is epic. The best hotel I have stayed at",5
My friends live in Singapore and they took me here for afternoon tea and champagne at the rooftop pool! They regularly visit but for a first timer wow just wow! This is the life and the ultimate in pampering! If you ever visit Singapore you must must go! And the designer shops are heaven! Spent 5 hours in Louis Vuitton!,5
"Great hotel for location, rooms a little small but didn't really matter as we didn't spend much time in them.  Food was good, service very good - if possible ask for a room with a view.",4
The hotel looks very opulent and grand but the service is very personal and courteous. The staff are efficient and happy. We stayed in an Orchid suite and the room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. The restaurants are amazing. The hotel is accessible and the light shows are very entertaining. The infinity pool is the icing on the cake.,5
Stayed one night in a room on the 40th floor - Tower 3 that smelled like a bathroom. Ordered room service the next morning - which never showed up. Called but breakfast went missing. Mentioned all this upon check out - staff not really interested. Back to the Fullerton. ,2
"I took my partner here for 4 days with the plan to ask her to marry me. On day 2 i couldn't wait any longer. The level 57 infinity edge pool was the location. After a nervous swim up with the ring in my hand and one of the best views I've ever seen i popped the question and she said yes!  Our time at Marina Bay Sands feels like a dream. You pay a premium for this but the outlay was worth the experience. I'm not a 5 star hotel type of guy but im glad i did this. The whole complex has absolutely everything you need. If you didn't want to see the sights of Singapore you really wouldn't have to leave and you'd never be bored!  The pool is amazing but get a chair early as it's always packed. The view is mindblowing. It really is, dreamy, can't stop staring mindblowing!  The…",5
"If you really wana know what it feels like being pampered, this is the place for you. Good food, loads of activities, classy amosphere, grand, and serene!!! A must visit place !!! Loved the shoppers at marina bay, almost every fav brand here welcomes your stay!!!",4
"You can enjoy a panorama view of Singapore landscape.As a narrow long shape of the pool, is really hard to accommodate large pool of crowd.I believe this is most crowded hotel swimming in Singapore.if you don't mind to squeeze in to the pool, you may have a beautiful floating in the sky photo shot in the pool.",3
"We were there for a conference. The facilities are great and the hotel is fairly new. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the food tastes great in general. I like the Infinity pool but it is usually crowded and the bar on the rooftop is excellent. The only issue is the check-in and check-out counter, the line is typically long. Love the room service, must check out their laksa on the in-room dining menu.",5
"Great hotel, great location. Helpful staff, rooms adequate. A tad expensive but a pool and view to die for. So much to see and do locally. Gardens by the Bay is a must, fab light show during the evening.  Love #singapore",5
We stayed at the Ritz Carlton our room had an amazing view on the Marina Bay.. It is a very nice spot .,4
"We booked a family room for our business trip, fortunately, when we arrived at the hotel for check-in they mentioned that we got a free room upgrade to suite room. The room encompasses a 1 bedroom with King size bed, bath tub, 2 t&b, sala, and pool. We got the whole group so happy during our stay in SG. Definitely one for the books! ",5
"A brilliant hotel in an amazing location, centrally located and near most of the top things to do and see in Singapore.ther is a shopping mall in basement where you can buy lot of things like watches clothes etc also there is a metro station unden the hotel. swimming pool at the top gives beautiful view  of the city.",5
"I have never written a hotel review because I have always believed that for the most part, you get what you pay for and if you are not paying for service then you are paying for the location or convenience. My husband and I love to travel and have stayed in everything from cheap hostels in remote places to overwater bungalows on private islands. I feel like we know what to expect and are always very realistic, positive travellers. I am just so blown away that this hotel has passed as a '5 star establishment' based on everything we have seen. My first hotel review couldn't even wait until we left, I am writing it from my bed at the hotel!   The hotel has 3 towers and 3 small check in counters. We tried to find a staff member to ask which tower we should head to but couldn't find…",1
"Getting there:  I recommend taking the MRT from Changi Airport to Bayfront stop (Circle Line). The train stops right beneath MBS mall, hotel and convention center. It's really accessible and love the convenience.  Check in:   I arrived at the peak of check in time, It was complete chaos and there were just tonnes of people all around. It was loud and noisy. Felt like a fish market. Didnt quite like the crazy check in atmosphere. I would prefer the conventional hotel environment which is more organized and personal. Our receptionist was very helpful, friendly and great though. That was a great balancing factor.  Room:  It's a basic hotel room setup. The bed is absolutely comfortable and the duvets were good. Nothing special about the rooms. Just like every other 5* hotel.  …",4
"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was - as our expectations accordingly - simply sensational. The hotel holds really what is promised by the appearance and the site. A gigantic 6-star complex in which everything is offered, what you can imagine, including a wonderful musical theater, a world-class casino and a shopping area and all this in a hotel. The highlight is certainly the Skydeck on the 57th floor on which provides the huge infinity pool with view of the skyline of the financial district of Singapore. There are probably not many more exclusive beach clubs as these, because hotel guests r denied access. Onlookers there are massive. The restaurants on the property are worth a visit, though expensive, but the quality is right.",5
"PROS: A brilliant hotel in an amazing location, centrally located and near most of the top things to do and see in Singapore. So much to do and see and most things are connected to the hotel (Art Museum, Helix Bridge, Gardens etc) EXCELLENT customer service! I was in a club level room so had access to the lounge- EXCELLENT service again- catered to my vegetarian and vegan family. Infinity pool!! CONS: None!!  Highly recommend staying here. Yes might be a bit pricey compared to other hotels, but you will get so many add-ons it will be worth it!  Taxis to Sentosa Island, Chinatown, Little India were in the $10-15 range and everything was walking distance.",5
"MARINA BAY SAND is really place to be for bussiness travel and luxury one you can find all TOP BRAND what you need the have it.  Its really paradise for woman , SHOPPING PLCE Shop till you drop.  when you stay at marina bay sand you can free to use the sampan ride just show your room key",5
"I'll start by saying I agree with a lot of the negative reviews here;  On entering the Hotel it's more like a shopping mall on opening sale day. The check-in process is a nightmare, I had emailed in advance as my wife was 7 months pregnant and we had travelled quite some distance and they still screwed that up. The rooms are at best OK, although my pregnant wife loved the bed for some reason. The breakfast has lots of options if you walk, queue and battle your way through.  If you have ever queued hours to travel to the top on an impressive building and then spend 15mins enjoying a view but wondering was it all worth it?  Please be assured the time to check-in, the general hustle and bustle of the hotel and the slight disorganisation is worth every second, minute and hour you…",4
"Stayed at this hotel for two days with my husband on a business trip. The location is set apart from the rest of the city, so you are a bit of a captive to mostly overpriced stores and restaurants. The best part, of course, is the pool! No one can say this place is not spectacular in sheer over-the-toppedness. (New word!) It's Vegas-style in Singapore. Lots of lights and bells and whistles. I found it kind of chaotic and busy. If you want to shop and gamble, then this is the place for you, although you can stay somewhere better and still do those things. You will get discounts at ""Marina Bay"" stores and attractions if you stay here. Not a bad incentive. The rooms are good, but not great. We stayed at the Westin on the other side of the water and it was a better location and…",4
There is only one pick up and drop point for all the tower. As we got down we had entered huge long lobby. Totally spacious but check in counter were small as compared to people check in hotel for stay. Staff was quick and helpful. Rooms are spacious with amazing Garden By the Bay or Singapore City View. Skydeck is always full visit anytime of day. But as one of the amazing view to the city. As evening comes Skydeck is all deck for the eve with people for drinks or for pool. Only issue come is to Indian Vegetarian People as there is low option available on menu.  But one must stay there to enjoy the luxury to fullest.,5
"It's a huge complex lots of designer stores our room was upgraded and it's very nice our view was really good especially at night we were facing the gardens this hotel is next to a main road and you can hear traffic we are in tower 2 6th. Floor getting around this place is interesting good luck with that. We have just stayed at rasa Shang gri la and our breakfast there was amazing so breakfast here was very poor in comparison considering it's more expensive but location I guess, no latte machines or personal service a lot of guests were looking and sounding disappointed too we had to pay an extra $52 for our 2 kids so glad we took them down to TOAST in mall we got them peanut butter on toast and milo x2 for $10. The pool is weird very small deck space good luck getting a lounger…",3
"What can I say.... Where do I start!!! Singapore in itself is so advance. The hotel is fantastic, concierge service, 3 towers shoppes bars restaurants you name it they have it!!! The view from the rooms are spectacular! The lights curtains etc all controlled by remote!! Walk in shower great, lots of detail to things like USB ports around the room..   To come to marina bay sands you really don't have to go anywhere else as there is lots to do... So long as you have the MONEY!!!   Casino was my favourite- British passport holders need not pay entry fee!  Would definitely stay there again",5
"It was a great hotel but was marred by the infinity pool access. My 12 yrs old daughter could not enter the pool as she was denied entry at the gate. We had only 2 room cards which only allowed me and wife to enter.   So what can my 12 yrs old daughter do? Gate staff said she need a room card to access as she is 12 yrs old but when I went to enquire at Front Desk, I was told to pay about $100+ per night for additional room card!!!!!  Pay that amount just to use the infinity pool ????   And now reading about Room deposit of $200 per night, I was also charged $400 immediately on my credit card but refund process takes 14 working days ???? Why does it require 14 working days ???  Most hotels I have been to take the most 2-3 working days and there is no need to call and ask. But…",3
"As we entered the hotel, we were met with a train station like queue at the Check in counter. And there the experience started. The hotel was huge, the room was huge and the pools were huge. But all the public spaces right from the reception to the pool was crowded. Yet the hotel had a machine like efficiency to it. The service was quick and efficient.  The views from the hotel was beautiful. Bathroom was huge with separate wash, shower and toilet areas. Being a Muslim, this was a negative as there was no water in the toilet to clean ourselves after using the toilet.  The pools were beautiful but was swarming with people (at least a few hundred people at a time) by the time we went for a swim in the evening, the water had turned dirty.  Apart from the opulent ambience and the…",5
"There is nothing much to say, its absolutely splendid and stunning. Me and my girl friends gather for a short staycation pampering ourselves once in awhile (which is a must!) overall facility is a double thumbs up. Room service will arrive very fast few minutes after you hang up the phone. Kudos to everyone!",5
"I was initially disappointed when I was being given a room that is different from what I booked. Credit goes to the front desk officer for doing something about it and upgrading it for free as soon as she saw my discontent. The new room was just perfect. One of my favourite hotels in the world, for sure.",5
"We decided to stay at the Marina Bay for the swimming pool of course and to celebrate our anniversary in a special place so we reserved a junior suite but when checking in, we had a wonderful surprise. : thanks to Dylan at the registration desk we were upgraded in a Sands suite : almost 150 square meters with a dining room, billiard table, terraces overlooking the gardens and the ocean. We had also access to the Marina Bay Club. Usually these places are quiet but considering the number of rooms (2 500) the Club is very big and busy but well organized with an efficient staff. The swimming pool ... amazing of course almost 150 meters long overlook the city at the 57th floor but overcrowded especially during week ends. If you are not staying with children, there is a part of the…",5
"Where to start….. After returning to Sydney, I have not stopped speaking about Marina Bay Sands. After my feedback to my friends and family, they have all confirmed they are very interested in staying at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) in the very near future. Upon arrival by taxi, we were greeted with exceptional customer service by the MBS taxi service team. They opened the door, took our bags down and offered to take it to our room. With all the humidity, the team were still more than happy to work and were still smiling AND their professionalism never stopped. I have stayed at hotels such as Four Seasons and Sheraton (not saying these hotels aren’t great) and I have not seen such great service. Upon entry, to the hotel (we entered through Tower 1 – Main Entry) you are just held back…",5
"We booked one night at Marina Bay Sands because we really wanted to experience the swimming pool. We have no regret, we fully enjoyed this amazing experience. At first we hesitate between Garden view or City view. We booked Garden View but we have been upgraded to City view. The view from the room is awesome. Afterthought, I would definitely recommend to take the city view. The room is very big, clean, very comfortable.  Of course, the best is the swimming pool on the rooftop. Simply amazing. One of those must-see place. You will be amazed by the view, both during the day and at night. Of course, you will have to share this experience. The swimming pool is always crowded, but it is still worth it.   I did not enjoy the club and the bar at the rooftop. Service is average,…",5
"Two bedroom suite (Singapura) plus two normal rooms for family. Firstly the room, huge suite, lots of extras that you would expect plus the great view that MBS is famous for. Have stayed in normal rooms before but this was a completely different experience. The difference is the dedicated butler that is there to make sure that every detail is looked after. We were there for a special occasion and the two butlers were just fantastic. Every little detail was looked after and everything was so smooth - checkin to checkout.  Fantastic experience. Pool less crazy (but still busy) then last time. ",5
"I stayed in the hotel with my girlfriend for one night, although we booked the basic room we got an upgrade to a suite on the 44th floor. The whole experience in unique, not cheap for sure, but it is worth to try once in a lifetime. Amazing panorama, lavish breakfast and the infinity pool the you can access any time during your stay. A must in Singapore!",5
Best hotel in the world. Every view in Singapore is drawn to this hotel so staying in it was spectacular. Our view was the garden by the bay view on the 36th floor. I would recommend this side as opposed to the city side as you can see the City views from the amazing infinity pool at the top of the hotel or the gym so enjoy something different from your room with a balcony. Press the gold service button on your in room service and all your needs are answered very quickly. It has a shopping centre & casino. Definitely one worth putting on the bucket list.,5
"Marina Bay Sands! It is my best favorite hotel that I never have seen such a beautiful scenery from pool located at 57th floor.  I could check in early in the morning because there are 2500 rooms, so huge I surprised. I go to the pool every day, the pool staff are very friendly to me.  Mango juice is good taste on the pool side.  I recommend if yoyo go to the pool early morning around 7 am is the best because it is not so crowded.  There is a show every night on 7 pm and 8:30pm. Do not miss it.  It is so wonderful.",5
"It was my second time visit. The service level was even decreased. I had to wait at least for 30 min for everything.  We have two rooms and we found out that one of our children was playing a very dirty slipper he found under the bed after we entered room. I had to wait for 30 min to make a complain about this and when i talked about it, the receptionist asked me ""what do you want me to do? with very arragant attitude.   I asked to change to room and he said he wilm change the room as same type for higher floor and asked us to pack our bags and bring them all to the first floor by ourselves.  I was speechless. I asked to change to better room as a compensation for my time and energy and he frowned and get us the room in different tower. I felt he treated me as a very troublesome…",1
"This is the type of hotel which is far more breathtaking looking from the outside in.   The pool, bar and restaurant on the rooftop are amazing and be light show and structure take your breath away but these elements only weigh up the standard amenities and rooms within the hotel, unless you are prepared the spend thousands per night!   Nice for the experience but I would rather stay in a hotel on the marina bay to appreciate MBS from the outside. ",3
We knew we were going to be staying in an impersonal huge hotel (2500 rooms!) so we were not expecting a great deal of service but actually the hotel pleasantly surprised us.  We were greeted very well and our cases taken off us and stored until check in later in the day very efficiently.  We checked in and all was good and we were upgraded to a better room with city views.  They provided a free bed for our son and we were not charged breakfast either for him....a nice gesture.  The check out was also efficient although I could see that at times there were large queues checking in and out.  There are a few niggles such as why aren't there any comfy chairs to hang around in in the lobby?  Why is there no milk in the rooms for tea (I had to pay $8 for some milk??).  Overall I…,5
"We checked in to celebrate my 50th Birthday on top of the world. We went for the pool  but discovered so much else.  Everything about this place is massive. Check in which mostly happens in Tower 3 is like being in a big airport. There are two check in counters - one for their suites and one for other rooms. From about midday until 4 pm in the afternoon there is a massive queue for check in. Despite the size the whole resort is relatively simple to find your way around.  We requested a suite the faced the bay. We got way more with our lounge and bedroom facing the bay and our bathroom overlooking the gardens and the ocean - so awesome. The lounge was huge with a sitting area, four seater dining table, flat screen TV, guest toilet, desk, mini bar and Nespresso machine. The…",4
"Was looking forward to my stay at the Marina Bay Sands. It's an iconic building to say the least. Checking in was pleasant enough as there was a line up. Locals and tourists alike were staying at this hotel which is fine. Also, tour groups from mainland China seem to dawn on this hotel too as part of their tour package I guess. The lobby was like a marketplace coupled with the crowds going to and coming from the casino.  Front desk were kinda friendly...it seemed to me like it was a put on rather from the heart. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable.....and quiet. Room amenities and toiletries were more than adequate. Had a sea facing room with the Gardens by the Bay in view as well. House keeping were efficient and pleasant, I think they are the unsung heroes of most hotels.…",4
"We first arrived yesterday the lines were not that bad.  The people working here all seem very nice, the Hotel feels a lot like Vegas.  Very Massive, feels very loud and very expensive.  The hotel offers the club level service, not worth the extra charge, the meals at the club level were mediocre at best, the service up there seemed very lost with all the guest.  To be paying over $1k per night the service is not in alignment with the expense nor is the quality of food.  We decided to stay here only two nights as others on Trip advisor suggested not doing more than 2-3 nights, advice well taken.  We went up to he pool area, my wife forgot the Sun Screen to bring with us, we where shocked to discover hotel sells sunscreen for a HEFTY price of $50.00 Dollars, yes $50.00 dollars. …",3
"Stayed at MBS for the 4th time and it is going to be the last! Every year the service becomes worse and worse. There was a problem with our reservation for second time and we spent 2 hours at the front desc arguing after an 18-hour flight! The management doesn`t expect people to stay for more than 2 - 3 nights and they won`t make you feel welcome again A part of the iconic sky park was under reconstruction, the infinity pool was crouded all the 14 days we were in the hotel. Although a great part of the staff were kind and helpful and breakfast, tea and drinks in the Club at 55 were good, we are not going to stay at MBS next year!",3
"We spent three nights in Marina Bay Sands last week. The room is with a king size bed and  an extra bed for three pax. However, housekeeping only topped up all the stuffs for 2 pax. Then, I called guest service for 1 more bottle of water. She told me it was chargeable. I asked receptionist and one of the staff in lobby. They all told me 1 more water bottle was chargeable. The most important thing was I already explained clearly to them that my room was for 3 pax, but only provided us with daily necessities for 2 pax.I was really angry because I paid for 3 pax, only 2 pax of necessities were given everyday. When I checked out, I asked the receptionist again. She told me that it shouldn't be chargeable as our room was for 3 pax. I don't understand why the staff here didn't listen…",2
"We stayed a few days on our way back to New Zealand after 8 weeks travelling. We came for the pool but enjoyed so many other features.  Check in and checkout were fast and easy as we were not a peak time. The service was very good and staff were friendly and helpful.   When we were at the pool we found the service to be very good. Vermar (I think that was his name) offered great drinks and food service by the pool and added to the pampered experience. While it was busy, we enjoyed the pool experience. Anyone wanting the pool to themselves should not be here.  Our room was very large with city views, the bathroom excellent and the whole complex very clean.  We found the heat of Singapore a little overwhelming so found it refreshing to be able to cross to a great shopping centre…",5
"Perfect stop on way back from Europe to Australia , the view from the rooms are stunning and the pool is out of this world plus the hotel is located close to most of the main attractions. Vermar at the swimming pool was great, he gave us advice on what to eat and drink and was spot on. Even the cleaner Jia Jia was so friendly and accommodating, the staff here are world class. ",5
The most popular place to be visited when you are in SIN. Fenomenal architecture in high construction. Good to come with family and small group. The place is clean and comfort for all travellers age. Don't forget to bring your camera to capture your memorable visit.,4
"We spent my birthday at the Marina Bay Sands in July...the best place to have spent a birthday!!  The moment we pulled up to the hotel, it was first class service all the way. We were just overwhelmed just stepping into the hotel foyer, it's nothing like we've ever seen before that left us speechless.. We were taken to the ""VIP"" check in, where everything was explained to us, then offered a drink in the Lobby Bar and Lounge, before being taken up to our suite. Which was located in the 2nd tower on the 45th floor with unbelievable views.It was immaculate. That afternoon we explored the hotel's luxuries, featuring the Sky Bar, Observation Deck and  Sky Pool. That alone was worth the trip, it was mind blowing and something that we've never experienced before in any hotel. The hotel…",5
"Booked a club room for a two day stop over. I travel a fair bit and use hotels a lot, but never stayed in such a brilliant hotel as this.   I have been in a few huge Vegas hotels, but the Marina Sands beats them all, I say this as I know they are affiliated.   From check in to check out, the concierge and the club level team, my stay was perfect.   I had a room in tower 2 on the 43 floor looking out to the harbour with the most spectacular view. Who need curtains. We breakfasted in the club lounge as well as for afternoon tea and again for canopies and drinks and can honestly say the variety and quality of food was outstanding. The staff were awesome, always remembering my name and addressing me with politeness and interest, keen to make conversation and to ask my requirements. …",5
"I love that place! For the view, food and especially for the concierge! My husband had his b-day at the time when we arrived and concierge was really helpful in organizing the cake and candles and everything. He was even watching what my husband was doing at that time to make sure that this will be a surprise.   Definitely a good idea for accommodation!",5
"This hotel is just a massive tourist factory. The rooms are average, food is awful and it is far too big and lacks any real luxury or personalised service. I wouldn't go back - looks good from afar but really just a big tourist attraction and not an enjoyable stay. Too many fabulous hotels in Singapore - this isn't one of them. ",2
The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is right in the heart of Singapore if one is looking for an experience. The hotel itself is good but the views from the very top are spectacular in every direction. The pool on the top is also something to see. Alcohol is expensive but you can just have a coke and get the same amount of pleasure. The ground floor level is like a very busy railway station with literally hundreds of people milling around. Shopping great.,5
"Alhought singapore dollar high rate now but if come to singapore must visited here, best place to shopping, and have fice star hotel, nice view, good price, have cassino area, large park, and near to go another place, i wanna go here again and again.. And this is photo me and my mother of law and sister too.",5
If you want the best of the best you have to pay for the best  however this would have to be the best place we stayed on our trip yet  if you want to be treated like royalty get to the Marina bay sands. This place has amazing views and service highly recommended. ,5
"Three nights in the Club with great room on 42nd floor facing the city. Service brilliant everywhere in this vast complex. Rooftop pool experience very dissapointing due to hundreds of guests all of the time. Getting a place to sit virtually impossible. No special area for Club members which was surprising. Many many guests in dressing gowns and slippers in lifts. Wet floors in lifts common. Not in line with the overall standard of MBS. Club lounge excellent in food,drinks and service. Probably needs to be larger. Not available to members at all times unlike other high end hotels. Access to casino needs passport both entering and leaving.",4
"The Marina Bay Sands is an impressive architectural structure, sitting on an outstanding section of real estate overlooking the Singapore Financial district on one side and the outer harbor on the other side. The hotel offers sweeping views, awe inspiring internal spaces and access to some of the finest amenities that Singapore has to offer (shopping, dining, gambling, museums). Unfortunately it does go all the way to delivering the goods, and for the price paid one expects just a little more polish on the edges. The check-in/check-out process is agonizingly long and the cost of dining anywhere in the hotel is over the top. Love the view, go elsewhere in the city to spend your hard earned cash on shopping, dining and drinking.",4
We stayed two nights at Marina Bay sand hotel on May 23-25.2015.Well the room was nice and big but the hotel does not have an Atmosphare of a 5 Stars Hotel.I think that it is because of the Casino inside.It makes things busy and noisy like in Las Vegas.The room for  around 600 Singapore dollar does not included breakfast.So it was a bit too pricy.BUT the pool is AMAZING....well to tell the thrue we only booked this hotel because we wanted to swimm once in that amazing pool.We wont go back again unless the price will go down.,4
"We just returned from a fantastic 3 week  holiday which included 6 nights in Singapore and 3 exquisite nights in The Club Rooms at Marina Bay Sands.   After a lot of consideration we decided to stay in a city view Club Room (2 adults and 2 kids 8 & 6). We felt the club rooms were really great value for money. We found the service was exceptional and personable. We chose a city view which we were very happy with because when you go up to the Club Rooms for breakfast, afternoon tea and canapés at night you can choose a window seat looking out to Gardens By The Bay or the city. So you end up with the best of both worlds anyway. We swapped our view each time, it was brilliant.  We found all the staff at The Club  to be exceptional, charming, personable, welcoming and professional…",5
"We spent 6 nights at Marina Bay Sands on our Honeymoon. The service was impeccable from everyone at reception, concierge, bell desk & in room dining. We felt like royalty and like special guests.. They upgraded us from the room we had booked in tower 3 to a bigger room with a bath tub in tower 1 at no extra cost & everyday when we arrived back to our room from sight seeing we had a animal made out of towels with a happy honeymoon card. The in room dining serviceman laid your napkin on your lap, poured your coffee and always ask before doing anything. Very professional. I would definitely recommend staying there if you feel like lashing out. Be careful of the laundry service they provide, it was quite costly but our clothes came back like new and all in their own bags, ironed and…",5
"Went there twice, stayed in premier room with city view @ 32nd floor and deluxe room with garden view @ 29th floor.  Premier Room – Twin beds @ Tower 2 - You are welcomed with fantastic Singapore city view when you opened the room door!! They are using auto opened curtain, the views is smiling to you once you opened the door - I love their bed, I do not want to leave the bed at all. It is so soft and comfortable - Their beds are big, more than super singles. And there is day bed near the window, to enjoy the day view and night view. - Had a great time in their big bathtub, and their bathroom is HUGE, one big bathtub, one big space with 2 basins, hairdryer, various of toiletries, and big mirror, 2 inner rooms inside the bathroom – stand shower and toilet  Deluxe Room – King bed @…",5
"The most popular place to grab a drink, for good reasons-it has the best view of all the city lights and is a highly popular place in Singapore. All foreigners, visitors and expats frequent the rooftop bar which serves moderately average drinks. If you want to visit the sky view platform, you might as well just grab a drink at the rooftop bar so you don't have to pay the fee.   KailaInTheWorld.Com",5
"if ever you want to enjoy your stay in Singapore, MBS has it all.. I often travel for one/two nights to Singapore and MBS could fulfill my every need from a relaxing room and good hospitality. Not to mention the perfect pool where you can see the best views of Singapore and a place where you can enjoy a night out with friends at Kudeta. And it also has the best food, I mean it you can find everything around this hotel from the most expensive meals to the cheap ones at the food court inside the mall connected to this hotel :)",5
This is the dominant building on the Singapore skyline and the top couple of floors are accessible for spectacular views over the city and surrounding seascape. You can pay s$11 to go to the viewing deck but a better option is to go to the bar on the floor above (free) and spend the money on a nice drink. Relaxed and comfortable and the service is second to none. Well worth a splurge,5
"excellent , superb . great break fast. amazing swimming pool. suits to every group members. Members were not ready to come out from swimming pool. all enjoy a lot.  hotel is value for money. Still need to improve support staff.",5
Very cool!!!! Beautiful building and beautiful view from it... For visitors like me it's allowed only to visit the bow of the vessel but it's okay for first time - I checked atmosphere. Next time when I'll visit Singapore I think I take the room for a few nights for sure. ,5
The pool has amazing view but too crowded.The room is just OK compare to the price.So easy to walk to the Helix bridge and Garden by the bay.The bridge at night is very beautiful and romantic.You can just walk pass The shoppes.,3
"The structure is incredible, composed of 3 towers joined by a skypool on the top. the Rooms are large, clean and quiet as well as overlook stunning views of Singapore. The skypool on the top is an experience of life! Good balance between price and quality offered. Reccomend!",5
"I have been there with my bf..We  stayed here for 3 nights.I was very happy with the room hotel, it was a great designed with a lovely furniture, and it was very clean.There are a nice breakfast...But service was just OK...a bit disappointed!!!!",4
"The pool. What more can you say about this pool other than it looks exactly as you see it in pictures. Just stunning. But, they do make it difficult for you to get there. You cannot access the pool before you've checked in to your room or after your check out time. So really, if you're staying for 1 night, you'll only be able to swim after 3pm. The rooms are luxurious and large. The free wifi was fast, too. We had a room with a view over the Gardens by the Bay, so the view was lovely at night. Because the hotel is SO large, it can take sometimes 10 mins of walking from your room and down to the reception, even longer if you're walking to the casino or shopping centre. It was definitely an experience and am so pleased I stayed here - but the pool...this made my experience.",5
"Perfect view from above, you can see the beach and Singapore city, enjoy the ambience and see other tourist, as well as gambling in the club. Everything in here is all about holiday and forget your routine for a while.",4
"I stayed for 3 days and was swept off my feet. My room is facing the garden's by the bay and was so relaxing - the tranquility that you would love to find in a hotel room. The bird's eye view in the swimming pool is exhilarating, showing off the business district of Singapore and on the other side a beautifully created garden. Though the pool got very crowded, I enjoyed my days drinking while soaked in the sun. Traveling alone could be both interesting and boring at the same time but I never feel alone as the service was great and the staffs and even managers are engaging. Thumbs up for Dax and Marecon for a great customer service.  This is definitely a ""must visit again"" hotel. Not just a place for slumber but a total destination to go for.",5
My husband and I only got a chance to stay one night here. Singapore is such an amazing place and getting to sit up at the pool area and take in the views was great. I hope some day we get a chance to come back and stay longer at this hotel. It's pricy but worth every penny!,5
"Have been to Marina Bay twice before but didn't find anything interesting beyond the normal lineup of high end name brands. But the opening of this Gordon Ramsey resto called Breadstreet made me go back. And I was happy I did. Food was fast and good, and service flawless.  Truly lived up to his name. The pork and the toffee pudding were good, and so were the rustic bread. Ambiance was great. You have the choice to sit outside and relax by the bay, or stay inside. Truly  lived up to his name. Incidentally in this visit, i found more affordable or mid- priced shops open. So my visit to Marina became more productive and worth repeating now.",4
"This place is just amazing. The infinity pool is the best view you could ever have in Singapore.  Staff makes sure you are happy and they offer an upgrade for first time visitors. It's pricey but it worth it for the experience. If you are not a guest, you can't go to the pool.",5
"We stopped here on the return leg of our trip to the far east. It is a hotel that is a work of art, stunning to look at and a phenominal structure. We had 2 club rooms for the one night which cost over £800.  I know that Singapore is expensive, however this place is certainly not worth that much.  The rooms were very average, not luxurious (we stayed at the Fairmont on the way out in club rooms - far nicer), the club lounge was nice, however we had to wait until a table was available as it was so busy. quality of food was OK but not excellent, just average.  The amount of people around was the killer for me - the pool (which to be truthful is the only reason why you would choose this place) is too overcrowded with very limited seating/sunbeds around the pool. it simply cant cope…",3
"Went really for their famous infinity pool and it was well worth it. The rooms are nice and clean, we got the bay view of the merlion which was nice. Cause the hotel is so big walking around feels like you’re in a shopping mall, didn't like that. We went to Sky on 57, they had great service and the food was real good. Very romantic setting. If there was no infinity pool this is a very average hotel.   The pool is a must obviously awesome views, nice and relaxing in the Singapore heat. Make sure you go up early cause it will get busy. We went up early and by the time we were leaving it was getting pretty busy up there. Saw Richard Branson by the pool doing an interview too.",4
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for anniversary. My fiance and I were mighty impressed, especially with the gorgeous infinity pool. We spent our first afternoon by the pool, swimming and chilling, admiring the sunset. Only issue was, it does get a bit crowded! There are free drinks available.   The room was spacious and new. Especially love the bathroom; very clean and bright. We had a view of the ocean so the day view was beautiful.  Service was excellent. Conveniently located above the MRT and an easy walk to the Garden by the Bay.  Lovely stay and would definitely stay here again (for special occasions!)",5
"I booked Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore as a staycation and a gift to my parents who were both celebrating their birthdays in August. From the time of booking till we checked out, the staff were polite and accommodating all through which made the experience a very pleasant one.  We were given a room on a high floor, facing Gardens By The Bay. The views were absolutely stunning, and personally, more amazing that the views which faced the CBD (even though prices for the rooms facing the CBD were more expensive). The rooms were very clean and spacious, and there was a balcony (albeit small) that we could access. Because the staff knew that my parents were celebrating their birthdays, they were given a complimentary birthday cake, which was a very nice gesture.  The only small…",5
"I stayed here with 2 friends in a standard room which meant we had to pay €100 for a night. The room was okay but definitely not worth €300 a night. However, the infinity pool on top was amazing! When we visited it, it wasnt so busy at all and the views are amazing.  Overall the hotel itself is overrated but for us the pool made everything!",4
"We were in Singapore for a family holiday celebrating my husbands 60th birthday.  On a previous stop over we had decided we would stay there for one night if we ever came back just to swim in the Infinity Pool.  So we booked in for one night before the rest of our family arrived.  It was the most expensive swim I have ever paid for but worth ticking it off our bucket list.   We booked a deluxe city view room and were upgraded to a premier room so that was a bonus, the room was nearly as big as our house.  The view was to die for especially after the sun went down with all of the lights.   We decided to wait until the morning to swim in the pool as it was absolutely packed when we checked in at 6pm and right up until it closed, so we headed up there around 8am, there were a few…",4
"I was very happy with my choice, i booked this hotel for the iconic pool on top and we were not disappointed. Everything was super: the pool, the room, the view, the service. Everything else was said already, the hotel has so many reviews. If i will travel again to Singapore i will book again this hotel",5
"Enjoyed my second stay at this great hotel in August, three night stay before a Madive holiday. Enjoyed the grand club suite room, excellent accomodation and service all round! We had a late checkin and were surprised to receive a special birthday cake for my special lady, delivered at 10 pm at night. Reception had picked up that it was her birthday the day prior to arriving, from passport details. A very nice surprise. The hotel location, so close to the Flyer, Skygarden and other attractions is vey handy. We took in a show at MasterCard theatre and enjoyed a while in the Casino, all onsite and so easy. Marina bay sands remains my favourite Singapore hotel, club rooms are great value if you can afford the bit extra! And of course the pool, well worth a try.",5
"My wife and I visited this hotel for 5 nights.  It is an amazing structure, both beautiful and useful.  The pool on the 57th floor is a sight to see in itself.  We stayed on the 48th floor and the view of the sea was wonderful.  The room was always very clean.  It is large but not huge.  I'd say more normal.  The breakfast buffet was great, but very crowded.  Lunch and dinner were good but not anything to go out of your way to do.  It is in a great location and city busses take you everywhere.",4
"located at the city center,hotel has a very nice pool with great view of the city..  walking distance to some of the attractions like garden by the bay and just across the harbour bay front. since the hotel is so big expect to be so busy and crowded everywhere around the lobby, pool area and restaurant too.  over all it a great experience to stay here and a bit expensive.",4
"We had a family weekend escape in Singapore and purposely chose this hotel for its iconic rooftop infinity pool. The pool didn't let us down with spectacular views. However, the pool is slightly too small for the amount of guests that this hotel can host.  Check in and check out process is very fast, rooms are nice and big. One thing that isn't quite work out for us was our room keys are constantly not working and we had to wait for someone to open the door for us each day when we return to the hotel.",4
"I just don't know where to start! We had to fly back via Singapore and booked 2 nights at this hotel as it looked so amazing. We weren't disappointed, it more than lived up to expectations and price. We booked a club room and ended up on the 44th floor with an amazing floor to ceiling view of the skyline which was amazing. The room was huge, with an enormous bathroom with a free standing bath and separate huge shower and 2 sinks. The bed was huge and comfortable and we had a sofa and armchair too. Check in was immediate with a dedicated check in line, and Alice on the desk was super helpful and friendly. We ate at the buffet restaurant Rise, which had excellent choices and quality, again with superb service from the staff. The pool was a slight disappointment as it was crowded…",5
"When i went there, exchange rate was 2.8 plus per SG dollar. Place was great but unfortunately haven for expats and foreigners only. My SG friends told me they never like going there because of overpricing for everything. With 3 plus per SG dollar today, its no wonder my fellow malaysians not going to its casino anymore and business no longer good like last time. Overall, still a great place 4 walking and window shopping with family.",4
"We stayed for a night from England to experience the Infinity Pool, as my son and I are both swimmers.   1) Visitng at 4.30pm: We went to observe the pool first without swimming. The pool was packed. It was difficult to move around. It wouldn't have been an enjoyable swim.  2) Visiting at 7.30am: The following day, we got to the pool early and the pool was much peaceful. We managed to swim for a few lengths before the crowd with selfie sticks and cameras started to arrrive.   3) Behaviour: It was interesting to swim on the rooftop, yet you need to learn to avoid bumping into people. A lot of people in the water were not swimmers. Some of them were rather loud or too enthusiastic with their selfies.   4) Water clarity: The water was cloudy.  5) Hotel Image: Many people would wear…",3
"Marina Bay is definitely one of the best hotels in the world. The moment you enter the hotel, you're in complete awe of the enormous property. The infinity pool is worth dying for and the casino is one of the biggest you'll ever see! Fantastic experience!",4
"The hotel is crowded, long queue everywhere. Staffs are rude and a lot of restriction even for hotel guest. Hotel service worst than 3 star rated hotel. Definitely don't live up to 5 star hotel level! Restaurants are pack with people, minimum spending even on accompanied children. Not family oriented, obviously not children friendly. restriction even at the swimming pool, what kind of 5 star hotel on world they are living on? ",1
"Had an incredible and memorable one night staycation with my family at MBS for birthday celebration. The service was impeccable right from the moment we reached the hotel, check in till check out. It was a great experience staying in MBS.  We booked the Orchid Suite. We requested for an early check-in, a high floor room, king-sized bed and a non-smoking room and I was very pleased that all my requests were acceded to. We were also allowed to check out by 12noon the next day instead of the usual 11am, which gave us more time to enjoy breakfast and admire the amazing city skyline. A complimentary birthday cake was placed on the room's dining table, which I thought was a sweet gesture from the hotel staffs. We got to see the astonishing view of Singapore's skyline from our hotel…",5
"Surprisingly, the pool size is much smaller than what i expected from the pictures. The property is huge and ceiling at lobby area is endless. We went out a night for the famous chili crabs, taxies are expensive, but they are mercedes.",5
"A wonderful staycation for X'mas celebration just that it's a bit pricy.   The whole setting of the room is just cozy in class. Good for family stay as well as couple. Excellent location, you have shopping centres all around.  We booked two Deluxe rooms and got a connected one too. Four of us with two king size beds.  The room that i had had a couch and a wonderful view of the Gardens by the Bay. Big TV, bathroom was big too. They even had the usb point for your phone beside your bed.  The infinity pool was crowded as usual. We spent hours up there despite the weather was gloomy. The view was just good and best if you went during August period during Singapore National Day, splendid view of the fireworks as well as the aerial display. No kidding on this.  It's a must go stay…",4
"My wife and I stayed here during a 3-day stopover on our way back from France. While the wait for check in was only about 5 minutes, the process itself took about 10 minutes since they claimed our room had not been pre-paid by our travel agent. The onus was put on me to contact my agent and have her contact the hotel, resulting in time wasted sending/receiving emails and talking to the front desk during out stay. The hotel had received the payment a month before we checked in.  Regardless we were given a wonderful room with great views. The hotel and shopping area is so huge you need a map to find your way around but walking throughout the complex is an experience in itself. Drink and food is very expensive but the food hall had dishes for under $10. The infinity pool is amazing…",4
"Great service and views. Reasonably prices considering the location and room that we had.   Pool gets very crowded, which I guess is to be expected. We had breakfast included - largest buffet I think I have ever seen! Huge variety of foods from all over the world.  Room was lovely and well kept. View of the bay from our window was awesome (especially at night). Bathroom was gorgeous,  with a large shower and freestanding bath.  Would definitely stay there again!",5
"We stayed for one just night in the cheaper type of rooms. It was simply amazing.   The room was huge, with and living room separated from the dormitory. The bathroom had both shower and bath.  The room had a long balcony along the dormitory and the living room with amazing views towards the Garden Bay.  The swimming-pool was fantastic. The views are the best of the city, specially at night. It opens from 6 am to 11pm, so you can make the most of your time of your stay. The swimming pool is big enough to not feel crowdy  The hotel is connected directly to the metro station and to a large shopping mall.  The staff was nice and helpful  Don´t lose the chance to stay in Marina Bay Sands if you are in Singapore. In spite of being expensive it is an unforgetable experience. Highly…",5
"Another must visit place. The tickets though a bit expensive for the Marina Bay Hotel, but worth the money",5
"When we first stepped into this hotel, we were amazed by the scale of this hotel, but also annoyed by the crowd and noise in the lobby. The check-in process took longer than we expected (about half an hour). Like everybody else, we enjoyed the swimming pool and the amazing city view it offers, it is beautiful both at night and day with distinct tastes of Singapore skyline. However, there are certain things we found inconvenient in our room, such as the shower, there is only one rain forest type of shower head which gave us some trouble when our 3 year old kid took the shower, this type of shower is not suitable for very young children. Basically this hotel is more for adults. Maybe it's because it is the summer vacation time when we stayed, the breakfast area was full of people,…",4
"Decided to treat ourselves after two months backpacking. The room was everything you expect for the money but at the end of the day it all about the pool which lived up to the hype, coulda spent days just sitting up at the edge and at the bar drinking and eating.",5
"Since it has been a landmark in Singapore, it has been flooded with tourist especially during SG50 period. The hotel still able to maintain its high standard of efficient check in/out service, valet parking and room cleanliness. The pool was packed with tourist during our stay.",4
"My now husband and I stayed here the night we got engaged last September, and couldn't have wished for a better setting for such an occasion. We chose one one of the club rooms (not a suite) and it was definitely worth paying extra for. The room itself was enormous, with views (from the floor to ceiling windows) overlooking the entire city skyline, and it's own dressing room area. Included in our room was afternoon tea in the club house, and cocktail and canapé hour in the evening. The food was delicious, and there was so much that we could have gone the entire day without eating any meals! The staff couldn't do enough to help us, and we're all so friendly. The next morning we also had breakfast included, again in the club house on the top floor, and this was also great. We made…",5
"Its worth spending so much for the sheer pleasure of its magnificent pool. The room is nothing extraordinary and is pretty decent. Service is excellent. The hotel building itself is an architectural marvel and the best view of the hotel is offered from right across at the Gardens by the Bay. If possible, ask for a garden view room. For a city view, its much better to try out the Singapore Flyer.",5
This is the only hotel where you will see people roaming in bath robes. Because this is only about the pool...and its awesome. ..take the city view cause when you walk in the room and the curtains open you see the city with a full window view...tht s when you realise you are in a magnificent place...when you sleep keep the window shades open cause when you awake you will see the city. The rooms are massive and they also give you an extra bed. The bed is wonderdul and so is the spacious bathroom. The mall and the food court below are massive and have some good options.  The check in and check out was smooth.  Beware of the photo con at the pool...expensive but good clicks... We stayed for nearly a whole day in the pool and it was worth it..... This is an experience that one…,5
"My Family (Mum, Dad and daughters 4 and 8), stayed here for two nights, after the weekend of Singapore's 50th Birthday Jubilee. There was a queue to check in, waited about 15. When we'd checked in the room keys are 'old school' credit card type, not that it's a big deal and the checkin assistant did comment that the system was being upgraded. When we entered the room we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the overall bathroom and room, although the fitout and décor was nothing flash, or that you wouldn't expect from a lesser star or older hotel. Our room faced the city which made for magnificent views out to the city and front row seat to the nightly 10-15min laser show over the lake, but I can't image the garden views would be bad either. The rooftop pool has amazing…",3
"Room was luxurious, everything was perfect! The pool and upstairs area were indescribable - I could not recommend this more. Absolutely beautiful! If you're in Singapore, spend at LEAST one night here! Oh, and the free WiFi was about 50mbps download - insane!",5
"I stayed with a friend at Marina Bay Sands for a week in early July. From Check In to Check out, the experience was one of the best.  Our room was on the 51st floor facing the city, and it was an amazing view.    The room was huge, had an Orchid Suite, with separate living, bathroom and bedroom. The rooms were very clean, the bed was very comfy, the space was great.  Enjoyed a number of facilities at the hotel, and all were a great experience. Especially the rooftop pool, an amazing pool, so don't forget your camera for some perfect pictures.  Breakfast on the 52nd floor of tower two was brilliant, loved the choice of food. The staff were excellent, and Ramana was amazing, she went out of her way to help get tickets for us to the movies, and suggest places to visit, such a great…",5
"Apart from the pool, the main drawcard and reason why we booked this hotel, overall it was a disappointing hotel stay which was a shame as it was also a birthday celebration stay. It was also disappointing to discover the pool are was being renovated (as well as some floors it seemed) and the 360 views promised were not available. Room rate discounts or at least notification pre/upon booking would have been helpful at the very least. The staff are unhelpful offering conflicting information, if not rude as were many of the hotel guests but that itself could be because of the way staff treated you. We had a club suite but then found out we couldn't use the club room for some reason...our keycards informed the staff at the counter of this.  Many times we were told conflicting…",3
well - the best part of the property is the Sky Park in the day Swimming pool at the top  in the evening and night Sky Park bar at the night Of course - the hotel Casino is must go. Rooms are OK Service is OK Stay once is recommended,3
"I just love their swimming pool :) ""Infinity pool"".  It is situated at the last floor( 57th floor) and you are just afraid not to fall down because it is so high and you can see there the amazing landscapes of the luxury city. There are also a very big shopping centre with luxury brands :)",5
I stayed here for one night.. I originally booked a garden view room but the staff suggested that the city view is better so I moved to a room in the 37th floor. I should say the view and service is well worth the money.. The skydeck and the infinity pool are amazing but it gets pretty crowded at times. The light show at night is a must see. It's free and it goes for about 15-30 minutes... The hotel it self has few fancy restaurants but if you want something casual walk to the shopping centre next door which has a massive foodcourt with amazing food.,5
"My husband I stayed here back in June on our Honeymoon and we cannot reccommend it enough! We opted for a Grand Club Room with a city view and it was definitely worth the extra money as the views of the marina and city at both day and night are brilliant! Our main attraction to Marina Bay Sandas was the skypark and it certainly was not a letdown - if staying here, make sure you use this facility both day and night as it is a completely different experience!  I have to say that the breakfast I had while at Marina Bay has to be up there with one of the best breakfasts I've ever had - such a great selection of foods on the buffet plus a good choice of dishes from the menu too, the French toast is by far the BEST french toast I have ever tasted! Looking forward to returning one day,…",5
"The intent of our stay was to relax for four days before returning to Austarlia. The infinite pool, sun and bar looked amazing on the internet. Unfortunately the pool was overcrowded during open to close times which wasn't at all relaxing. If you are looking for a place close to the city that is reasonably priced it's not this place. The room was great. The prices for food and drinks was over the top.",2
"Well, there's no doubt this hotel is special but one look from that pool and the experience is even more jawdropping. Dusk is amazing as all the building lights start to come on.  The breakfast buffet downstairs is also excellent and caters for every need.  My only criticism, albeit minor, is that sometimes there was a fair queue for the lifts, otherwise the stay was perfect.",4
Our 1 night stay was such a treat which we had really saved for. We were able to check in early which was fantastic and the check in procedure was smooth despite quite a big queue. Our room on the 33rd floor has a beautiful view over the Gardens. The room was huge and had a gorgeous bathroom.   My only negative about this hotel would be the swimming pool. It was seriously overcrowded with many children in the adult only area despite being asked to leave by life guards. I was disappointed about this due to the amount we had paid for the night as I didn't feel it had a very exclusive feel. ,5
"The hotel is nice when you can come up at the top floor, else, it is boring and expensive and too many outsider tourists. We stayed for three nights and booked for executive room and since our flight was delayed, we got a room in 2nd floor which is very disappointing, with no view rather than a busy road outside the window. The sink doesn't work, so we have to call at 2 a.m to fix the clogged sink and the toilet is not working properly as well, the water runs continuously even after you have flushed",3
"The room was warm and comfy, service was good, albeit they did become a bit sloppy sometimes. the best part was the view from the infinity pool at the sky terrace! the casino access and privileges were good. We had some room service and food was decent.",5
"I didnt stay in the hotel personally but for my relatives instead.  Booked e premier room garden view and was allocated room on 34th floor facing gardens by the bay - spectacular view of the garden as well as the surrounding.  Very spacious room.  Spacious bathroom has both bathtub as well as standing shower. As the Kids went to the pools at 3 different timings - wasnt so crowded even though it was on weekends (as compared to my first visit!).  The garden and city view from the cafe near to the pool is spectacular too!    Early and online booking gets you a much more cheaper price (if you miss it, that's it! thats my experience :( ) will book again only if i can get better rate - not worth to pay S$1000over for one night stay!",3
Its an amazing View with great photo opportunities but beware anyone that thinks you can get close to the Infinity Swimming Pool as you will need a telescopic lense. The only way to get close is to be a guest in the Hotel. They take your photo before you go up in the surprisingly smooth & incredibly fast elevator then superimpose them onto views of the whole area Very nice but not cheap.,5
"We came to the hotel for one night! It was very busy with a longish que to check into the room! And you had to check out at 11 which I think is quite early! Although after speaking to the lady on the desk who was very helpful, told us we could check out at 12!  The view from the pool is incredible!! We paid a little extra for a city view in our room which was definitely worth it!!  The gym is awesome and was extremely quiet when we went! Also the sauna and hot pool are worth a visit too!  I wish we could have had more time there to relax and enjoy all the facilities but I guess we will just have to come back again soon!   Definitely made our visit to Singapore a memorable one!  The light show was amazing! We watched it from a boat in the bay! Incredible!!  Thank youuuu ",4
"Beautiful hotel but a little overcrowded especially the pool, it is beautiful especially the night view but don't think about swimming in the pool, we can barely walk across to take picture. Room is clean and has luxury linen and towels. One of the best customer service.",4
"Nice place! Modern design and very cozy. A complete set to spent a night. Very nice pool and great view, especially during the night. It's a good place if you are a cityscape photographer and best city lights view during the blue hour, golden hour or during the night. ",5
"After six stays at MBS our seventh stay still held nice surprises. This time we were welcomed warmly by the Premier Services department where Miki, Jeraldine and the team made our stay delightful. Of course, the hotel is already wonderful with its stunning rooftop pool that we have brought our baby daughters too time and time again.",5
"Spent a fantastic three nights here with three teenage kids who LOVED the rooftop infinity pool. Even after 72 hours (most of it spent up there) you can't tire of the spectacular view particularly as night falls and that gobsmacking panorama becomes an awesome skyscraper light show. You do jostle for position in the pool and on the terrace for space around this time. On occasions it felt every single occupant of the three towers had relocated to the roof complete with selfie sticks and go pros.....Still who can blame them! The rest of the hotel is pretty staple city centre five star with large bedrooms, nice showers and wall to floor windows. The whole feel in the hotel is similar to an upmarket Las Vegas resort with themed celebrity endorsed restaurants and huge communal areas.…",4
"I was excited to go back to Singapore after a long hiatus. Last time I was in Singapore was 2008 and I stayed at Mandarin Oriental, Marina Bay Sands was just a dream then...I guess it should have just stayed that way. I really wanted to stay at the Marina Bay Sands because of the pool area and bevy of restaurants in the connected mall and casino area. I was very disappointed. The arrival was like coming to a poorly planned airport, chaos and no organization for traffic. You enter through an anonymous glass facade to be greeted by an equally massive void space with no clear wayfinding on how to check-in! We had club rooms so there was a separate checking, but we were not told nor was there clear signs! So we waited in a long line to check in. Got to our room, granted it was big,…",2
Marina bay is basically an area & a five star hotel..An amazing scenic view from the top of the sky park..Pool view is also superb..You can see Marina bay almost from all places in singapore..A heart of the city..,5
"I was been in Sinapore in november and I stayed in this amazing hotel! It's the biggest hotel when I was been! Very smart, very beautiful, with very large and open space!  The room was ok, very nice, maybe too expensive for this kind of room.  The bathroom maybe was better!  The best place it's the big pool on the top, you can go there and have relax behind pool, or inside the hydromassage!  Very good experience, amazing view of Singapore!  ",4
"I emailed the hotel before we arrived to let them know that my GF was having her birthday the day we arrived and was hoping for a cake or something a bit more special for her (as if the hotel wasnt special enough already). The hotel said a cake wouldnt be a problem and we would have it when we got to our room. We checked in at about 9:00am as I had a busy day planned but no room was ready at the time, no issue, we left our bags and went out for the day. We came back at about 4:00pm and the concierge walked straight to us without either of us saying a word, he then escorted us to the VIP check in which I thought was a nice touch for the GF's birthday. The VIP receptionist then kindly informed us that due to the circumstances and a previous stay the hotel had upgraded up to a…",5
"The architecture of the building invites every visitor to this place.. Moreover the view it provides from the Skybar of the Gardens By the Bay, Singapore Flyer, the F1 circuit and the city is mesmerizing.. The place gets all the more interesting after sunset with the lights taking the control of the skyline",4
"I booked for a night in MBS's Orchid Suite. From the time, i arrived that had service staff to bring my baggage to the room while i checked in. The check-in staff was very polite and friendly; after finding out i had friends from overseas who would be staying with me, she upgraded me to a marina suite (1 size bigger). The room was significantly bigger and much more spaceous than the original room i had booked. It had a nice overview of sea which was beautiful at night. My foreign friends also felt the same way. They loved the skypark and how the hotel is connected to the shopping centres [Shoppes] and shared that if they ever came back to Singapore, they would definitely come back here [MBS].  Overall, the facilities were good. The staff were friendly and responsive. The room…",5
"Room and service was very good, but for the price that you pay, they could throw in a few extras like mini bar or breakfast. Most people book this hotel for the fact it is the only way to access the infinity pool. Which to be honest wasn't the leanest pool I have been in.",4
"My husband and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands during a part of our honeymoon in June 2015. Of course the reason we came was for the rooftop infinity pool and that was honestly the best part of the hotel. In Instagram pictures, they don't tell you that the hotel is a huge convention center and houses 2,500 rooms. They were at almost full occupancy when we were there, so let's multiply each room by two (outliers being single persons and families of 3-4) and say we and 6,000 other people were there at the same time.  Breakfast was included in our room rate, so on the first morning we went down to the restaurant Rise; there's a huge line. We understand it's for table control and so it's not a complete mad-house, but still, a line to sit for breakfast. Going through the buffet was…",4
"we stayed jsut for one night so just to have exess to the infinity pool and just to try it out.  Our view was towards the ""Gardnes by the bay"" in floor 34 or so can't remmeber it exat, but it was very high up.  The rooms are nice and tidy, the minibar is filled up to the brim and the serice is top notch but... Everything is a lot pricier (Well ,duh) then elsewhere in Singapore. We stayed for 4 days in one hotel and kept this one for the final day of the trip. The service was similar if not identical (regarding room service and the menu available) yet here the prices were ~0.5-1.5 times higher.   Of course, it is a luxury hotel and a very modern one at that. Despite it costing 1/3 o the price of a 4 day stay in a different hotel, it is worth it. Believe me. The pool, the service,…",4
Got upgraded to a high floor executive suite with a city view. It was the biggest hotel room I have every stayed in full stop. I could have played football in the room it was so large. It had an amazing view of the city and it was just a few floors below from the pool deck and so was very convenient. The pool is amazing...fantastic views and good resort feel....although it is very busy. Breakfast was included and we had it at the restaurant on the pool deck which had great views too. Plenty of food options but we tended to go to the food court or shopping centre close by. Convenient for gardens by the Bay. Great area for a walk or jog around the marina.,5
"Obviously this is one of the most iconic hotels in the world. The architecture and the design of the hotel is super cool.   At the end of the day, however, you feel like you are in a zoo. There are so many people everywhere that it takes the enjoyment out of it.   We had 2 rooms with access to the club level. Rooms were super nice with great views.   The pool is certainly worth the visit. However, they have construction going on and so there is so little area to use. Additionally they run you through the lower bowels of the place to get to the pool.   Service is just OK. It is not that it is bad, but for the money you pay you would think it would be a lot better. Not personalized at all. Even the club level is really like eating in a regular restaurant. Nothing special.  …",3
Marina Bay Sands Hotel is hugh and linked to the conference and casino complex. Checkin staff were helpful. We had to wait for our room to be ready but they were quite effiicent. The rooms are spacious with good view of the new garden and Singapore Bay. The roof top pool is impressive but can get crowded. The views are impressive and most people want to take selfies in the pool with their smartphone. So maybe worthwhile to consider a waterproof case in case of accident?,4
"This hotel/casino/shopping mall is a beautiful site to see even if you're not looking to shop or gamble. The building is beautiful and there are many yummy restaurants for all price ranges. Stores are on the pricier side, but worth a look. The casino is well managed and makes for a fun night.",5
"Marina Bay Sands it is a wonderful hotel. Its a big complex with shopping, casino and celebrities chef restaurants. Check in was quick and i could get my room about 12pm. We stay in Orchid Suite, the suite was very spacious and amazing view Garden by the Bay, the decor the room is just average, nothing like wow. The amenities bathroom its really cheap quality, for the price u pay for a suite, you should expected great amenities. The bed was nice and comfortable. The room is clean and good job daily housekeeping. They gave us a nice complementary cake and strawberry chocolate because was my partner birthday, very nice! The breakfast was very good with good selection. The hotel have a amazing gym with incredible views. The pool is amazing, such beautiful view from Singapore, a…",4
"This hotel has its reputation as a landmark hotel. Yes, it is a great design and an engineeringmasterpiece with an awesome pool, but the hotel, shoppes, casino are average when compared to other resort, hotel casino combinations around the world. I stayed in Tower one in a Premier Room. Upon entering the room I discovered housekeeping were still in the room and were disconnectiong an ozone machine from the power point - not really the start I was looking for, then whilst unpacking I noticed that blinds kept openong and shutting by temselves and contacted customer service who said they would send someone up. 45 mins late after two additional calls they finally decided to attend. Time may not be precious to them, but it is for me. Then whilst  continuing to unpack I noticed that…",3
"Room, amenities, infinity pool and everything else is fantastic!. Service was like a 6 star. Chocolate bar was amazingly good. The sights of the bay when in the infinity pool provided an aerial view of the amazing skyline. The weather was hot but the lush water and spa provided a real relief. The shops within this area was also packed with great stores and shops. MRT was just a stone throw to other nearby eatery if needed. Concierge was a tremendous help in guiding us to other places.. must go... Bugis Junction... the hustle and bustle and not too far away from here.",5
"We stayed in August 14th for a few days with my 8 year old daughter.  Pros - Pool on the SKypark 57 th Awesome Staff -  Exceptional they were all professional, prompt, courteous, friendly and very helpful first class all the way. Room- fantastic with a fantastic view we were on the 42 floor our bed was comfy, plenty of storage, bathroom fantastic with all the amenities one would require. TV- lots of channels  Ce LA Vi bar- SKypark 57 floor - food was absolutely delicious pricey as you would expect it to be as it is a 5 Star hotel but I was happy to pay because the snack bar menu was delicious. Try the waygu beef pizza Omg it was so good 27 dollars yes pricey but you won't regret it. Also the calamari yum yum yum...I could have eaten the entire snack bar menu because everything…",5
"This hotel is definitely worth the price. The rooms are huge, we appointed with awesome views. Service is exception and of course the highlight is the Skypark and swimming pool which can only be accessed by hotel guests.",4
"MBS delivered on 'something for everyone' for food, shopping and entertainment, especially for well heeled visitors. It even has an ice skating rink but no takers, an art and science museum and an artificial canal for short rides on a small 'gondola'. I made the rounds of designers' stores with my visiting ladies friends whilst the men played at the poker tables in the casino. I thought that we finished off the MBS trip with a quick visit to the famed pool at the Skypark on 57th floor. We didn't because of $23 fee per person (there were 4 of us) - shouldn't casino guests' family members/ friends be given a pass to go up there while they were at the casino?",3
Everything is fantastic. Quite pricey but worth every moment staying here. The i nfinity pool is a must-go in marina bay sands..it feels like you're swimming in the air..the room is superb and the centralized aircon is pretty really cool and the bed is worth sleeping for after a long walk in the city..,5
"Just fabulous . The swimming pool is good and the views are to die for . Its worthwhile to pay for club privileges because the food is excellent. After reading the mixed views , we were a bit unsure , but it was amazing . Location is good and being in the shopping mall its a great way to spend time . My kids want to go again !!! ",5
"We visited this hotel because spectacular swimming pool and really interesting building. Pool is full every operation hrs,lot of very noisy and no well behavior small chinese choldren/teenegares! Check-in/check-out cery quickly and really profesional,staff very friendly a d helpfull,very attention to our children. Some parts of room was screthed. Room service perfect.",4
"We love the pool - we hate the guests with over 2,000 rooms the only pool is way too small the hotel is living of the hype of the structure consider - the hotel was built by a casino chain so nothing else matters - unless you smoke and gamble - stay somewhere else  However the staff are amazing",1
It is a different luxurt hotel. You should experience the pool at the top. Very nice scenery from the room. Ask always a higher floor room. You have a chance to see world class celebrities around. Very big rooms. Breakfast is rich. You should try.,5
I have been to this hotel before and found I had a really good visit. This time me and my partner visited the sky bar for a few drinks while we watched the sun set.  Customer service was good. Make sure you dress smart. Costs were high but what do you expect. It does get quite busy here. We arrived at 7pm and left just before 8pm to watch the light show.  We will return.  ,4
"Most people came for the world famous infinite pool and I'm not the odd one out. The view from the pool is amazing undoubtedly. Everyone will love the pool and I really think it is one of the most lovely pool worldwide. Since it is so famous, the pool might be operated exceed its designed capacity. The water quality was quite poor on the day I visited (Summer weekdays). Management should take serious monitoring about the water quality. Besides its lovely pool, the room facilities are also important to the hotel. I arrived at 11 a.m. and the check-in has not yet open. I stored the luggages in the store room. Their safe storing service is very nice. They will send all your baggages to your room after you check-in at the front desk. You don't need reclaim the baggages at the…",4
"Excellent hotel. NO need to explain it. You don't need to Orchard or other areas in SIngapore. Shopping center is next to the hotel and casino is also there. All rooms are clean and neat. You can see the garden or marlion from your room. At night, the garden is illuminated and it's so beaitiful. It's nice for couples.",5
"What more can be said - it has incredible views in the day, and at night is jaw dropping with a spectacular display of lights around the bay from other buildings. I have been to Time Square at night but this is by far the most fantastic place to visit. If you get the opportunity to go when a Formula 1 race is on the night street circuit it is out of this world. Even if you don't have an interest in motor sport it will be an experience that you will never forget. Singapore bay in the night is one for everyone's 'Bucket list' you must go !!!!",5
"Amazing hotel you have to experience if you are in Singapore. Of course the pool at the roof top is the main attraction but not only. You are close to a shopping mall, the famous gardens at the bay, the casino, inside shops, laser shows during the evening, ...etc... On top of that we got a very spacious room around the 40th floor with a stunning view on the city. Unforgettable moments.",5
"This was second time round staying here, although this place was still completely as incredible as the first, I have to lower the rating as there are a few gripes (especially for people who don’t like crowds).  For many people the main lure to this hotel is undoubtedly the infinity pool, however, it seemed extra busy (it was coming up to Singapore National day, so can understand to a certain point), the pool was way too overcrowded compared to our last stay there and was hardly any space to move around, you couldn't get a sunbed near the main pool, We literally had to wait until it started raining! It is probably better to go here off peak season when it should be a lot quieter.  There were also some signs saying one of the Jacuzzi's was for ""Adults only"" but was swamped with…",4
"Out of my 5 day stay at Singapore, I stayed here for 2 nights, just to experience all the hype of staying at Marina Bay Sands! The entrance and the reception is rather congested and not well organised. You need to stand in long queues before you are attended. However, everything apart from that is just magnificent ! The stay makes you feel like you're experiencing something special. The staff is very courteous. And well, the infinity pool.. It's worth every penny you spend at the hotel !! Recommended for a at least a couple of nights on your visit to Singapore.",5
"Wow the scale of this hotel is incredible. It is massive and easy to get disorientated & lost. The pool and executive lounge on the roof is really cool and our suite was beautiful, spacious & had brilliant views. Connection to the shopping centre which gives you extra dining options was great, plus the casino but we did not go in there. In a way the hotel is kind of too big which made it feel impersonal compared with other luxury hotels. They messed up the check-in booking for our travelling companions which delayed us getting into our rooms for 2 hours, but to their credit gave us free drinks and a late check-out on departure which was good service and calmed the frustration. Is it worth the money?? I think we will try somewhere else a little more cosy next time.",4
this property is simply out of the world.. its gorgeous!! the staff is very courteous and helpful.. all amenities are easily available.. the food is delicious and the best part about the hotel is the swimming pool.. had an excellent experience!!,5
"I was on a Sout-East-Asia trip with my brother and we started off our route with a weekend in Singapore.  The MBS was a choice we made mostly due to the spectacular rooftop and iconic location at the Singapore Bay. The room was of average size compared with other hotels of the same standard. Cleanliness was good - as well as room service and in-room facilities. However, not really outstanding and therefore rated rather average for a hotel of the standard and pricing.  The rooftop with its unique infinity pool overlooking the bay and absolutely stunning view is worth the visit alone. Hotel guests can use it for free - outside visitors have to pay (at least this was the case at the time of our travel). There are 2 restaurants at each end of the rooftop - both with very good food…",4
"This is the hotel you must stay at, at least once in your life, just to tick it off from your bucket list. The building is absolutely fantastic, you can see it pretty much from everywhere you go in Singapore. The hotel itself is too big, the line for the check-in/ check- out is almost like the airport's security line. If you ask me if it's a good value for the money - no. Room rate is expensive, the breakfast is not included, the mini-fridge is on sensors - means you can't remove anything without ending up paying for that, not even to put your bottle of water to cool off. The pool is great, the view and everything. Water in it is pretty cold, I guess so people wouldn't hang out in it for too long. Don't forget your selfie-stick! Otherwise you will be the only one without it ;).…",4
"Checked in but our room was not ready yet but the front desk staff gave me and my boyfriend an upgrade instead!! The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff was very helpful and friendly. We were only able to stay 2 nights as it was expensive for us but totally worth it!! It's a once in a lifetime experience for us. The infinity pool was incredible as it looks over the Singapore skyline, absolutely beautiful!! Will definitely go back if I have the money!!",5
"Admittedly, I had received a complimentary upgrade but this hotel was fantastic. It has class written all over it and boasts outstanding views of Singapore. The service was exceptional and the rooms were first-class. I'd stay there every time if I could afford it! The big tip is to get to the pool early, otherwise it can be quite crowded. Also, try to check in early, as sometimes this is granted.",5
True it is a special hotel. The swimming pool is astonishing but that's all you have for that price. Make you wonder does it worth around 400 USD. I visited twice in the hotel and every time I come there is a queue of 20 min to check in and their hospitality is cool and feels like mass production. Never had a nice simile person helping me. So if you really want the experience I would recommend to check in for 1 night and the rest in a hotel like the Park Royal which is in the same price you get an amazing hotel with breakfast and amazing pool.,2
"Amazing location! The pool was amazing too! Bell service and staff were excellent. Can't wait to go back! We are planning again by March 2016! The staff were all professional looking, very friendly and accommodating.",5
"We stayed here as part of a package for the world stamp exhibition (7 days, 6 nights). The hotel staff were super-friendly and helpful in all aspects. You could not ask for better service. The hotel is impressive - the nicest part is the infinity pool on the roof, although it is very crowded most of the time (best time to swim is 6-8 am). The rooms themselves are only fair - no microwave, no place on the fridge to store food, no table convenient for two people to eat at. Certainly not what I'd consider 5-star.  But don't come here for the shopping. Prices in the mall are out of sight. $22 for a pint of ice cream. $60 for a simple hat. Breakfast a minimum of $30 (from the room servive menu - $46). Then there are the Rolex and other expensive stores. I guess if you're a…",4
"Stayed on few occassions. Once it was Mid Autumn Festival and we had a room that faced Gardens by the Bay. Walked over using the connecting bridge to see the beautiful lanterns on display. Great experience. The service staff was friendly and prompt. Breakfast at Sky 57 was great. Love the view, great service and amazing food. One of the best hotel breakfasts.   Other ocassions we stayed like duing National Day or New Year's Eve, we could see the fireworks from our room which had a city view.",5
"We had 2 nights at the Marina Bay Sands on the 40th floor, with club benefits.  It was a lovely luxury and well worth paying the extra for the club benefits.  It is a huge busy hotel, so don't expect to go there for peace and quiet.  The staff are great and you are very well cared for.",5
"We stayed there one night during a stop over in Dubai on our way to Bali. This building is a dream of architecture and this pool on top is its diamond. If you pass by Singapore you should go there for one or two nights. I wouldn't stay for a longer period because I couldn't afford it but once in your life you must stay there and swim in this incredible pool. Tips: try to get a room on higher floor. Marina view is stunning. On top floor by the pool, you have plenty of possibilities for breakfast/lunch/dinner at reasonable price and quality, with a stunning view. ",4
Stayed in 4369 a Orchard Suite with City View.   Unbelievable view at night particularly and from the bathroom a lovely view of the harbour & gardens.    Lounge area and bedroom separate which was nice.  Bathroom beautiful with separate shower room and separate toilet. Powder room with toilet at entrance of suite.   Very spacious.  Bed comfortable and express guest services I couldn't fault with regard to luggage and printing of documents etc.   The Club Lounge has delightful views and food was delicious and fresh. All staff efficient and attentive.  Skypark has amazing views but the highlight is the pool! Wow!   Adults only area and plenty of towels and beds for All.   Views are breathtaking.  Enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands.  Would definitely return!   ,5
"Stayed the hotel during the 50th anniversary of Singapore. ..We didn't expect that it'll be chaotic and mad city. However, checked in was hassle free and quick enough were taken into our humble room.  Feeling giddy to try the pool the following day but left dismayed to see that travellers used the pool like a toilet. Saw more mono pad ladies on the pool. No chance you can swim. We give it a missed on the first day. Unbearable to see some guest walking around the lobby wearing their robe.  In terms of bar..ce la vi was spot on... The rest of the hotel staff and services were ace.",4
"We stayed here for our final night in Singapore in December 2013.  Note that there were two check-in points for the hotel regarding which tower you're staying in. Regardless of the number of check-ins, the queue for check-in can get quite long.   Rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. We had the city-view which was beautiful at night. Wifi was fast and free. Did not dined at any restaurant at MBS as I'd rather try local food from local joints.   We were given a card for pool access. There were too many people using the pool for photo opportunity than swimming itself, but if soaking in the water and taking in the twinkling lights of Singapore cityscape under the night sky is your thing then be my guest as that's what I was doing!  Great hotel, the hotel also allowed us to…",5
Im not sure whether I would stay here for a long period. But would definitely recommend even just a 1 night stay to swim in the infinity pool.  You have to be a hotel guest to be able to get to the pool area.  Service is smooth for such a large hotel and with so many guests it never felt it was crowded.  Close to Underground station and Mall.,4
"Excellent hotel staff. The moment my husband and I stepped into the hotel, a staff met us and took over our luggage. All the staff we encountered were outstandingly professional , spoke good English and extremely well-mannered. Two thumbs-up! We had an early check-in at noon and late check-out too. My premier room was good too other than the less than impressive toiletries.  Because the hotel does not have an enclosed private lobby of its own - the lobby is an open public space - it can make you feel like you are in the middle of a fun fair or a fish market. The infinity pool , which was the main reason why I chose the hotel to staycate, was many light years from infinity. We could barely move more than 5 m uninterrupted each time we were in it because of the unimaginable crowd…",4
"Having stayed at many hotels before, this has been one of the best hotels I've stayed at. The customer service is impeccable, with en eye to every detail. Not to mention the facilities were wonderful. Although, finding a sun lounger by the rooftop infinity pool proves to be quite a challenge!  For this mother daughter trip, we stayed in a Twin Premier room (Tower 2). The room was very comfortable, not much different to other five star hotels. However what truly struck me, was how the staff always went above and beyond. It was quite unfortunate that my mother fell ill on this trip and the staff were attentive and catered to our every need. This level of professionalism we experienced (is lacking in this day and age) and it is so refreshing to see such high quality in of customer…",5
"Was here in conjunction with a world stamp expo.  I wish I had read the reviews on trip advisor first.  It is very very overpriced.  Even at the convention rate we got for $500/night for 6 nights.  Fancy schmancy.  Couldn't believe it when they wanted to charge an extra $30.00 for breakfast for a second person in the room .  And then instead of allowing us to eat in a real restaurant in the hotel where the breakfast was much better, better choices, fresh eggs cooked as you wish, nice fresh fruit, they delegated us to a function room in the convention center, where things were reheated in pans as if you were eating in a Holiday Inn Express restaurant (actually that was better).  Absolutely disgusting, in my opinion they ripped off the organizers of the exhibition, and therefore…",1

There is no system, that you can stay with your friends, even if you have booked much in advance !!!  Lobby is much much crowded... NO PLACE TO SEAT WHILE CHECK IN !!! There were no proper information while check in that, where can be the Vegetarian breakfast?  Breakfast was superb at RISE restaurant.  Staff co-operative with smile.  There are lot of attraction nearby and also few in same premises..But is is massive...Sky pool is superb but again big crowd.  They should keep some area in Lobby reserved for hotel guest only...",4
Only stayed for one night because of a stop over. Hotel was super busy and people everywhere  (the whole hotel was booked out) but staff were still friendly and attentive.   Room was spacious with large rooms overlooking the quay and city. Comfy bed and pillows. Ensuite was large and had a separate toilet and free standing bath  Infinity pool was a tiny let down. Only because it was so full and no chairs were available but the drinks attendant was so lovely he saw a chair available and reserved it for us. There was also construction on the top floor but did not impact the use of the pool. Sunset was lovely and the water was a great temperature.  Loads of dining options but be aware food & drinks are not cheap. Im guessing there markets close by to get a cheap meal.  Would…,5
"I have to be honest that i just choose this hotel because of the most famous swimmingpool on the world - guess what - im glad i did! maybe during the day its not so amazing like my imagination before i got there (i thought the swimmingpool is bigger then in reality), but during the evening, when the sun goes down, and sky getting black its really impressive! the city lights looks just amazing! u feel like u are in right moment in right place - and this is the feeling i enjoyed a lot. Delicious drinks! Location is just awesome, hotel is connected to huge shopping centre, u can find there whatever u like. Nice rooms, high standards, huge, with a lot of free space, u can feel very comfortable, like home. Definitely i advise u to go - even just for swimmingool!",4
"If you're not staying at the Marina Bay, you can still access the sky deck to take in the amazing views of singapore. BUT that's all you can do. There is no pool access and the snackbar at the top is rather disappointing. However if you're in singapore it's worth going up there in the evening, the views are breathtaking",3
"Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Marina 2 weeks ago, below is what I thought of the hotel;  Location: Great location, 1 minute walk to the shopping centre where the MRT can be caught too. The shopping centre has lots of restaurants to choose from including a food hall area with lots of little street food style available. There is also a few mini supermarkets to pick up essentials from like water.  The Hotel : Check- in is a mammoth operation, the check in area is super busy and can take at least 30 mins. This isn't necessary the hotels fault as they do have at least 12 people on check in, it is purely down to the size and popularity of the hotel. They do provide  seating in this area so that is always an option. Check-in is meant to be 2pm but we were advised to go back at 12…",4
Celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary at MBS. What a great place to spend some quality time with the one you love. Fantastic hotel at a great location. Definitely worth while spending a bit extra for a club room with city views. High enough to enjoy in-room dining with fantastic views behind the floor to ceiling window.,5
"With 2500 rooms fully booked, a lobby full of rubber necks and non guest visitors, it is easy to excuse a lack of personal service.  I have read a number of mixed reviews in the MBS and I can certainly see why people might complain but it is what it is.... a bloody massive hotel/casino/shopping complex.  So, if you want to stay somewhere for a peace and quite and have people kissing your behind this is NOT the place, but if you want to be in the thick of a thriving hub and dont get to precious about a lack of personal service this is the place to be  The rooms are huge, the pool is busy as hell and the drinks and food is expensive but it is a cool place and plenty to keep you occupied!  In my opinion the staff do their absolute best to please but are being torn all over the…",5
"We know our review (especially in English so I will post it in Chinese too) will have almost no impact on this Hotel but we needed to write it on the hope that we ‘save’ someone from what we experienced.  Our stay was horrible. Bad service, rude staff and rookie mistakes. Countless mistakes with our keys (key cards) not working. From the moment we checked in we got to the rooms (we had adjoining rooms) and only one set of keys worked. The staff went to change the keys but took such a long time we didn’t wait. Again we had issue with the keys not working in the elevators. No, we weren't storing the keys next to a cell phone which one of your staff members suggested the 3rd time we got them 'reprogrammed'. Since we visited the reception several times and handed over key card we…",1
"The hotel is really awesome. Huge and with a very beatiful design. It is a must to visit it but that's all. Don't stay there.  I spent three days early August 2015 in a Club Room with my wife and my two kids The first surprise was the reception. I arrived around 20.00 and I found around 30 people waiting to make the check in. After 20 minutes, I made the check in and We arrived to the room. I was expecting something really amazing and I found a small room with just one bed for four people. I call to the reception and they told me ""We are sorry but we are completely full"". I had to go to the reception and spent 60 minutes discussing with different people, finally they gave us a room with two beds.  The rest of the stay was ok. The Club Lounge is great (there is not a lot of…",2
"Well located in the Marina Bay area, this hotel reminds you of the big Vegas hotels. If you're looking for a boutique/intimate setting this is not for you. Our room was big and comfortable, but overall the hotel is too much. The roof top pool was freezing cold and overcrowded. If you must stay here, take your picture in the pool and go to other, better options in Singapore.",3
"nice view....everything you want for shopping is there.If you love for photograph, don't mist the sunset on 57 ... Stayed one night   50 th. celebrate  in singapore  amazing view of skyline on city view. I will never fortget.",4
"My wife and I stayed here for several nights on our honeymoon in June, 2015. Although quite expensive, it truly is a spectacular hotel with amazing views and fantastic shopping, restaurants, activities nearby.  The room was spacious, clean and well-appointed. The staff was simply amazing. Since we were staying in the club level rooms we had daily breakfast in the club lounge. Everyone there was friendly, kind and extremely professional.  They have an amazing chocolate buffet which I think was one of the highlights for my wife -- I think I might have gone into a chocolate coma. We also had a surprise cake compliments of the staff to congratulate us on our honeymoon - a wonderful touch.  Concierge was knowledgeable and friendly and helped guide us as well as book restaurants,…",5
"My stay a this hotel was quite an experience, the hotel is so big that you need a map to know where things are. I stayed at the executive floor in tower two, great views, the room very spacious and well presented, and all necessary things that you need were provided. The b/fast is good, buffet with lots of choices and plentiful. The infinity pool is a must, the only bad part is always very full, the chairs seems to be always mysteriously occupied with towels... Also seems that the majority of people only want to take selfies... The positive thing is there is a part of the pool that is adults only which is good. The gym facilities are adequate, and the showers equipped with all necessary. Staff is mostly friendly and useful. The building itself is quite impressive, and there are…",4
I rated this a 5/5 because it is spectacular. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already. If you've seen the photo's and you want to add it to your collection then you have to do it. I stayed one night and it is what it is - AWESOME. check in sucks tho as you have to line up for ages but after that it's so good. the rooms are brand new still and the view is heaven. All the amenities rock and rooftop bar is as good as it looks and the casino is cool. At the end of the day you just want to get all those photo's and say you've done it so just do it. Then the next day stay somewhere just as good for half the price.,5
"Choosing to stay here on a business trip was a wise move.  The hotel is amazing and has so much to offer.  Aside from heading out to business meetings, you really don't need to ever leave the comfort of the hotel to enjoy your trip.  The rooms are extremely comfortable with views that can't be beat.  You'll be in one of three towers that are all topped by the Marina Bay Sands Skypark that spans the top of all three towers in the shape of a ship.  With an affinity pool and bar, you will definitely want to make a visit to the top to see it.  Bring your room key or you won't get in.  The views are incredible from the top.  The Casino, shops, and tons of restaurants are connected to the hotel via an underground walk way.  So many options you could spend a week here and not get…",5
Took my mum here during my second visit. She was very impressed. We had a free room upgrade which I expected as I booked two very expensive rooms. It has amazing views but being a popular hotel it's getting far too crowded which I guess can't be avoided but it has put me off from visiting in the future. Far too many girls in the pool taking up space with their millionth selfie.,3
"Amazing Singapore! Yes!  definitely worth every penny. A clean city, relaxing and breathtaking sceneries all over. One of the countries I would definitely visit all over again and again and again... Singapore = never ending surprises...  I love SG!",5
"I've stayed in this hotel 3 times during my visits and the latest stay in May was the worst of them all. My first stay was in 2010 when the hotel was just opened which was really nice. The service was excellent. My second stay was 2014 and it was still ok. However throughout the years, I had noticed that the service is declining. The lobby has become really noisy and crowded. The room is not properly clean and the room service just take forever to arrive. I think they might be understaff but given how much they charge for room per night, I would really expect a lot more from them.",3
"Was a dream to visit & managed too. The room / suite are well decorated, bright & spacious. A trip to the sky pool is a must. soak into the breeze & view with a Singapore sling on hand. The buffet is generous & rich for choices. ",5
"I went yesterday to Marina Bay Sands, Beautiful place where we can buy intl.luxury brands of all things.  But, If you are looking for traditional local food, you can find for affordable prices. Try it!!!!",3
"My wife and I stayed at MBS for two nights in April 2015. It certainly lives up to its name of being Singapore’s most iconic luxury hotel and this is unmistakably matched by a big price tag. Well, I guess it was after all worthwhile as what we got were some unforgettable experiences. The suite we stayed in was more than spacious for two adults and its gold-themed furnishing really made us feel like Kings. And of course, the Skypark and the Infinity Pool added more to the sentiment by offering you stunning and unrivalled views of the Singapore city skyline.   In terms of accessibility, MBS is located just above the Bayfront MRT Station and a lot of amenities and tourist attractions are just within reach. To name a few, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Barrage, Singapore Flyer and the…",5
"Yes, it's busy.  Yes, it's expensive.  But the views are breathtaking.  Everything is new.  The shops can keep you busy for a week if that's your bag.  Otherwise there are more than enough things to do within walking distance.  The canal boats come right up to the hotel.  And the pool at the top ... man-made wonder.",5
"I must say the hotel looks awesome from a far...very cool architecture and must be the most photographed hotel in the world! Inside, it feels a little like a big impersonal hotel a la Las Vegas. The 56th floor Infinity pool has an amazing view and is gorgeous and looks exactly as photographed on website except it is PACKED from 8 am until late. Getting a chair poolside can be a challenge, and the pool is really crowded with tourists and selfie sticks. Excellent idea to have an Adult Only section although the poor lifeguard was constantly blowing whistle to get the errant kid out. The roof bars and restaurants shared the view and Happy Hour was very pleasant. Service was good and impressive considering the size of the hotel, and I liked location close to sites, restaurants,…",4
The view from our room facing the city is to die for.  It was worth the price.  The room is huge with a glass window from ceiling to floor.  We kept the curtains opened all the time.  No visitor can enter the elevator without the guest so an added plus to security.  Infinity pool was great but can use a little shade.  Best to go there early morning or late afternoon. Will be back there and book a room facing the Gardens by the Bay for a different feel.,5
"We recommend staying in this place just for an experience and not for your entire visit in Singapore as it would cost you. The room that we got was nice with a balcony and a view but it was not totally stunning. The shower took a long time to warm that I almost had a very cold shower (not so 5 star at all). As my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary we were welcomed with a dainty plate of chocolates but it was incomparable to the way the Jumeirah Group pamper their guests when celebrating special moments. I particularly requested for a few simple arrangements upon booking but they just ignored it and was not even aware so it had me thinking they were not attentive to the request of their guests.  Overall, we cannot take away from this hotel what we had enjoyed. From…",4
"Yes it can be busy in reception and at the pool, but this is an iconic hotel. It is in a great location and the view from both the pool and our room (36th floor city view) were amazing. Being in the pool on the 57th floor for the SG50 celebrations were a memory that will live for ever as we could nearly touch the planes and fireworks. Both check in and check out wee completed within ten minutes of arriving in reception as there are multiple staff on hand both to take care of luggage and process your room. All staff are very helpful and make you feel special. Bayfront MTR station adjoins the hotel so good transport links, and also large shopping centre (although majority are luxury brand shops and never seem to have any customers) Would happily stay again",5
The Hotel is great; so many amenities. Walking distance to malls and shops. Pedestrian crossing to assist with movement. Pool is  amazing; right on the rooftop. Restaurants on the roof top as well as on the ground floor. Room service available. Rooms are large and very clean. Very helpful staff. Large array of food  selection for breakfast. Very large space to accommodate people for breakfast. The entire hotel is always bustling with activities. When you first get in there; you wonder; why so many people? This place is so crowded! But then once you settle in; it's a nice place to be.   The Hotel building itself is a masterpiece; quite impressive but then I later discovered that most Singaporean buildings are all amazing skyscrapers. It seems what they lack in terms of land…,5
"Almost rooftop cocktails. Sat in cocktail bar, one floor above observation deck. Worth every penny ( dollar!). For the same cost as a visit to the observation deck and sky walk you can sit and relax with a cocktail and meet fellow travellers. We sat with some lovely ladies from Hamburg who were stating a Mid East cruise from Singapore. Had a wonder around the hotel - people watching at it's best!",4
"The only reason I actually enjoyed my stay at the MBS was because I was upgraded from their standard room to an Orchid Suite, which included a living room, 2 balconies and a view on both sides of the hotel. Other than that, the hotel felt much more like a resort and not like a luxury hotel, which one would expect considering their prices.  Most people are going to go to the MBS for the pool, and I will tell you now, it is really NOT THAT WORTH IT. The pool is always, and I mean always (from the 6 AM opening to 11 PM closing) completely packed with people and their expensive cameras. It is nearly impossible to get a lounge chair anywhere in the pool area and you will have little to no space to do anything but perhaps sit along the wall of the pool and look at the city, which is…",3
"Stayed here with my mum and sister for one night. We arrived around 12noon and checked in early, the receptionist upgraded our room as she had said because we were only staying one night, we could make the most of our time there and allow us an early (and late) check in/out. That was very nice. Our room had one king bed, and a sofa bed for the third person. I found that a bit odd that a hotel such as this one weren't able to provide us with at least a proper single bed, for the third adult. Nevertheless, we werent going to waste any time and went dtraight to the pool. Amazing pool, best pool ever. Cocktails at the bar were delicious, and having an 'adults only' section of the pool was ingenious. I was slightly humoured when the lifeguard would kick any children out of that…",5
Amazing amazing amazing! This place is definitely getting my 5 star rating. To swim in the infinity pool was on my bucket list and decided to stay for 2 nights as well with a friend in a twin room. The pool was freezing haha (doh!) but the views and atmosphere are amazing. The beds are super comfy with luxury linen and pillows we had the the best night sleep.  Highly highly recommend and will definitely stay again if I get the chance.,5
"This is one of the greatest experience I've ever done! Our Culb-Room was at level 40 with a overwhelming view to the city! Fantastic! The room itself was very big and clean. Everything was there. The club upgrade includes coffee and beverages (snacks) at the club restaurant at level 55. Again, a great view either to the City or Ocean. The staff was very friendly and obliging. Big choice of tasty dishes.   If you miss the infinity pool at level 57, you missed something in your life!",5
"The highlight of this hotel is definitely the infinity pool - simply gorgeous views, even for a Singaporean like me. Needless to say, a lot of my time during my 3D2N staycation was spent inside the pool!  Prior to my stay, I was told that the pool is usually too crowded to swim, but it wasn't too bad during my visit. Of the three sections, one is for adults only and the lifeguards do pay attention to any children who get into this section and would beckon them to the other sections. I was able to swim some laps without disturbance. Over at the two Jacuzzis though, although one is for adults only, there were no lifeguards to enforce this and we often found the jacuzzis packed with children who shouldn't be there but are shrieking and yelling and affecting the other guests'…",5
its a must visit place...!!!...its like newyork. amazing view of skyline of singapore . fabulous marina bay sands building,5
"The pool in the roof with views over Singapore skyline is breathtaking. I recommend it go there either at last or first hour to avoid overcrowding. The room, even if it´s well equipped, is nothing astounding. Except in the case that you usually move in this range of prices for hotels, I would say that a single night is enough to experience what the hotel has to offer to you…",4
"I travel to Singapore a lot, and prefer to have a room in a hotel with a harbour view, and of the Marina Bay sands; a spectacular structure.  However, a visit to MBS allows you to enjoy the infinity pool, etc. This is worth a visit. At night, the rooftop bar Ce La Vi (formerly Ku de Ta)  allows a night time view with a drink.  The check-in was swift, the room was ready when we arrived (check-in time is usually 3 pm) and while check-out is at 11 am, we were given 1 pm.  We had a premium city view room which was large, well equipped, and allows for a nice view of the Marina Bay area.",5
"Visited the hotel with a lot of anticipation and excitement, because of everything I heard and read about it...but after leaving the hotel I must admit that the hotel wasn't worth a visit!   When we arrived, I felt like arriving on Changi Airport...nobody opened the door and didn't help us with our luggage until we called them...no sign of friendliness and politeness...check-in was like standing in the queue at the airport and the check-in process was fast, so that the next one come to check-in...no sign of a warm welcome...  Our city view room was huge and the view to the city was amazing! Such as the infinity pool which was fabulous! But those were the only positive aspects of the hotel...  The breakfast in the morning was directly next to the reception, so you couldn't eat in…",2
"Stay in the hotel with my parents in May 2015. Booked a room with city-view. They thoroughly enjoy the stay here. Especially the buffet breakfast, the city view from the room and and the infinite pool . They are impressed by lobby and the shopping mall as well.",5
"Stayed in a Grand Club Room which was amazingly fitted out, spacious and the views from both the balcony and the bathroom were breathtaking. The infinity pool was as spectacular as photos I had seen, and the food at The Club was delicious. Check-in was professionally and efficiently handled despite the crowds in the foyer. Excellent location to shops and sights. This stay cost more than our usual budget for accommodation but it was the last leg of a 5 week trip to France, and it was a decadent way to finish off the holiday. I felt very spoilt and it is a stay I will never fortget.",5
"The room is over priced, we were told we would get a bathtub but when we arrived we had no bathtub in the bathroom, we called to change room but hotel was full. Amazing infinity pool and city view but i think that is all you pay for. I have stayed in nicer rooms before for a much cheaper price. Was an amazing experience but wouldn't pay to stay again. Excellent wifi and bed..good location. very clean and tidy and convenient.",4
"On the way back from Maldives, we stopped in Singapore for the two days.  Pro: 1. Rooftop Pool for hotel guests only 2. Good location (subway was located right next to the hotel)  Con: 1. Expensive 2. Buffet (it's was not all you can eat style. Appetizer and desserts were unlimited. But  You only could select 2 main dishes) 3. Too crowded hotel",4
"Stayed for a weekend but I had the time to enjoy all the facilities the hotel can provide. The room was fantastic with views over the bay. The service was OK but nothing to remark, I expected more. Conveniently located next to malls , restaurants and well communicated with transport. If you like keep yourself on fit, do not hesitate visiting the gym with its first class equipment. But the cherry on the top is without any doubt, the infinite swimming pool with stunning views on the rooftop. It really made my stay worthy",5
"Was there for a night stay to watch the national day fireworks. Very fast check-in and out despite the crowd. Room was roomy with a stunning view facing the Marina float. Bathroom was huge, however there was no lock in both the toilet and shower room. Not a problem for us though. Great shopping just opposite the hotel. Overall, great stay! ",5
"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and were very impressed with everything. Given the size and number of people it can accommodate the check in was very swift with the staff being welcoming and friendly. Our bags were brought to our room.  We were in a standard room in the third tower. The room was spacious, clean, very comfortable and had all the amenities expected. We were in a twin room so it had two separate beds. These were slightly bigger than a single but smaller than a double. In the bathroom there was only a shower.  The pool area does get busy which is expected but there is still space and we always managed to find a sun lounger. There is an adults only section too. The view is great. There are also two jacuzzis which are lovely, so hot. One is adults only.  There…",5
"My visit to Marina Bay Sands has to be one of the most iconic experiences ever. The property doesn't need any introduction with its world class facilities. Guests who arrive early, are greeted with an access to the Gym/Shower/Pool area. You can get fresh out there, sit by the pool and enjoy the restaurant or even take a dip in the pool. The infinity pool has its own charm during either side of the morning or evening.   MBS is centrally connected to SMRT and you can actually get down to all the nearby places using that.  ",5
"Spectacular Hotel, stayed at the presidential suite and the video was amazing. This hotel left nothing out and if you like to gamble, the casino is first class.  If your scheduling ahead, be sure to book Ramseys restaurant. I was sad not to get in but Hide Yamamotos made up for it in spades.   The hotel's roof with its infinity pool overlooking downtown Singapore, what can I say other than it was the best rooftop I've been to, wow.  Location, shopping, restaurants, transportation all in one place, outstanding stay",5
After paying over the odds and expecting a good experience our check-in started with staff being confused on what tower we were staying in.  After 30mins of deliberating they finally decided on Tower 3 however once we were in the room we had to call the cleaners up to wipe down the sides (juice marks) and spruce up the bathroom from the previous guest.  We only had a one night stay and a short period in the hotel but our bubble was burst from the check in.  The views were great but expected more for the money,2
"Although massive hotels like Marina Bay Sands aren't my favorite, I had this one on my bucketlist ever since it opened a couple of years ago. Sure, the price for two nights of almost a $1000 SPD wasn't something my wallet agreed upon, but the rooftop pool, great gym and ditto room made it all worth while. Also, although check-in time was from 3.00pm onwards, our room was already available at 11.15am, which saved us from wandering the streets of Singapore as hobos for a few hours. Great Service!  Again, if you're not in to massive, busy, large-scale hotels Marina Bay Sands might not be something for you. But if you want a short, once in a lifetime experience, it's well worth the money!",4
"An iconic hotel, made popular by social media and good photographers for its architectural design and the rooftop pool. The service is average, whereby the outlets are overly pricey comparable to other 5* properties in this category. Certainly good for one night stay for the experience only. The quality of the breakfast on the rooftop restaurant is amazing, whereby the dinner in the same place is not recommendable.",3
"My travelling companions and I loved this spot. The Marina Bay Hotel is out of this world. The swimming pool on the roof was crowded, but we made the best of it. We had lunch in the adjoining restaurant, which was Devine. All in all, I would highly reccomend staying there, or just going to the restaurant for lunch or supper.",5
The facilities are endless and rooms are very nice.  The staff still manage to give a personal service despite the size of the hotel and complex.  Any issues we had were resolved positively and on the whole it was a good experience.,4
"i stayed here a few years ago, so I am sure that things have changed since then, but I will give you my opinion on it.  I think first of all it is iconic to Singapore, so I felt we had to stay at least one time while we lived in there.  My wife was pregnant when we arrived and our room did not have a bathtub which she wanted.  The front desk was nice enough to upgrade us to a suite room at no charge which had a tub in it.  Going to the swimming pool on the roof felt like being a fish in an aquarium.  They let tourists up there, so it was hard to relax with tons of people always coming in huge groups taking tons of pics.  I am not sure if this is the case now, but it was when we went.  The other bad thing about it is that since the hotel stays at such a high occupancy rate, the…",3
"This is easily one of my favourite hotels of all time! From the moment we entered MBS we were treated very, very well. We stayed in the cheapest room possible and it was amazing. The room was very modern and BIG, I really liked our bathroom which also had all the cosmetic supplies you could need. We had a straight view over the Gardens by the Bay and watching the show from high above (57th floor) was pretty amazing.  We didn't have breakfast here, but the food and drinks by the pool were great! We did have dinner at the Ce La Vie on the rooftop, food was good but pricey. It was also a bit disappointing that every customer had to spend at least  80 SGD on foods and drinks to be allowed to eat there. So I would recommend you to go downtown for dinner. As a backpacker, I must also…",5
"First, the hotel must be inundated with gate-crashers because the staff seem to only be there only to keep people out.  Anywhere you go, you will be encountered by unfriendly staff demanding to see a room key.  Each person must hold a room card key too, even children!  Don't bring enough room cards and you'll be sent back to your room to look for the key.  Go to the pool -- show a card.  Gym -- where's your card (I was asked three times!).  But when you need a snack or a drink, the staff are invisible.    Secondly, the pool is the only thing about the hotel that makes it worth going.  If you have the right amount of room cards and can get past their staff, then you can get up there and appreciate the pool, for all of five minutes.  Once the novelty wears off, you then have to…",1
"After doing our research, we had very high expectations for this hotel as the last stop in our honeymoon! Upon arrival, they did upgrade us to a larger room with city views which were just magnificent. I would recommend staying here for one reason, the infinity pool on the roof is an experience like no other. However expect no privacy whatsoever. It is packed. Even on weekdays, there were people everywhere. Chairs with some shade are very few, and if you are as pale as myself, you will burn very quickly under the hot Singapore sun!!!! It is a great location to visit the gardens by the bay, and the attached shopping centre was also a great place to shop. The light show was also amazing, a must see!",4
"We decided to stay here one night at the end of a cruise before returning to Europe.  We really wanted to experience the pool at the top.  The hotel is huge and is confusing and a bit of a circus in the lobby with different check in and check out locations depending on the room type, etc. We asked for an early check in and were not able to do so.  Nonetheless, it was after 3 PM before our check in was available.  We asked for and offered to pay for a late check out and were only granted one extra hour.  The hotel was booked solid, and it is very much like a large convention hotel in terms of the traffic of people.  It does not feel like a resort. The pool at the top is heavily guarded and they check keys and only allow one person per key.  Which is a good thing since many…",4
"If you ever go to Singapore, this is the place to go. Not because it is the best hotel I've ever been to, but because of the view and the gorgeous infinity pool. When the doors of the elevator open on the 57th floor, you just won't believe your eyes.   The downside is the size of the hotel: it is huge. And I mean really huge. If you like peace and quiet, this is not your ideal place. The whole complex is always full of people, and the hall looks like a giant mall. Breakfast was OK, but nothing special compared to other luxury hotels, apart from having to queue to get a seat.   Also, the subway is really close so you can get to anywhere real quick. ",5
"I've been staying at this hotel for my business trip and I choose it as it is the landmark of Singapore. As a matter of fact you can only use the infinity pool if you are a guest. Obviously the view is amazing, the pool is wonderful, a little too cold and you can't really swim as there are lots of people taking pictures. The room was big and comfortable, but there was nothing special about it. Conveniently localised between the garden and the mall, everything is beautiful and close by, but awfully overpriced. And I mean the hotel, the restaurants, the clubs, the mall...but I guess it is just Singapore. It will be a one time experience in my life, next time I return I'll choose another hotel for sure.",4
"My second visit to the MBS hotel. I must say that it is much better maintained than those hotels in RWS . Which was absolutely run down when I went for a second visit about two years after their opening. MBS rooms are still pretty new and nice. The mall is extremely big . And there are of course a lot of attractions nearby. The stay is good, but it is expensive. From hotel to food to parking to even bottled water. I guess that is expected , and for me it's a once in a while visit. So I would say that is fine. But expensive still.",4
"beautiful view over the city from the infinity pool. Good and friendly staff and no children are off-limits from other side of the pool, which is nice when u only wnat to relax and enjoy yourself. Can only say the view and service everywhere is great.",5
"This is the epitome of hotels!  As you walk into the main lobby at Tower 1 (a total of 3 towers), you are greeted by a huge, bright and airy atrium.  There are dance and orchestral performances held at the atrium during the day.  Also in the atrium is a lounge and their buffet restaurant, The Rise.  There are 2 check-in areas at this hotel.  One located at Tower 1 and the other at Tower 3.  Elevators in Tower 1 and Tower 3 will conveniently take you up to the Skypark on the 57th floor.  If you lived at Tower 2, you'll have to change to a different set of elevators in order to get there.  One of the drawbacks we've seen is that the floors of the elevators that serve the Skypark are usually wet and, sometimes, with black marks because of swimmers that take the elevators back to…",4
Nice view of the Singapore Central Business District area specially at their infinity pool but too cold for me. Try a dip @night specially on Saturday you can see some fountains and light show... the rooms are ok. Everything ia controlled on your tv and you can checkout without going to the lobby... ,3
"On arrival to the hotel we stood in the queue to check-in. A man came up to us and informed us that we could check-in in the other queue as we were staying in a 'Club' room. When we got to the Club & Suites queue the woman behind the desk literally RAN around the desk to us. To which she proceeded in saying ""Can I help you?"", my Fiancé replied ""Yes, we would like to check in"" to which she said ""I'm sorry this is only Club and Suite room check in's."" We were absolutely flabbergasted! How dreadful of her to assume that we could not afford a Club room.  This hotel booking and the whole day was a surprise to myself as my boyfriend had just literally proposed to me not an hour before. If we weren't on such a high we probably would have confronted her there and then.  When we told her…",3
"I was on a raymond business conference from 2nd to 5th aug,the pool is worth every penny,though food(indian) and service is average. Tip - must go to the pool at night open till 11 pm also the jacuzzi is awesome.",4
This hotel is top end of luxury. Definitely has the Wow factor. If you stay you must visit the infinity pool at the top of the hotel shaped like a curved ship. Views don't come any better than this both day and night.  It's location is perfect close to the Palisades and the wheel and the artificial gardens. ,5
"It was definitively the hotel with the best view I ever stay. Of course that the way you enjoy the view is very personal, you can enjoy viewing mountains, sea or the man creation. In this particular case, being on the pool at the top of the 57th floor and see the whole city ""down"" when you are on the swimming pool was just great. The service is very good and the rooms confortable.",5
"Wonderful place to stay,nice view....everything you want for shopping is there,so ya just jump in the shopping mall to spend your money,hahahaha....moment of joy that will never be forget how we spend our time together no matter in or out of Singapore....",5
"Rooms, service, ambience, location are all absolutely top drawer.  You won't be disappointed.  Make sure you eat meals on the top floors both dinner and breakfast.  It will be a little expensive, but quality and variety is great.",5
"If this hotel didnt have the pool it would be worthless. The Lobby is not welcoming, the staff are friendly but have so many people to cater for i felt our stay was somewhat unwelcoming.   The rooms are nice we overlooked the gardens, which you can see the light show from. Bit disappointed that our room didnt have a bath tub.     ",4
"Checked in from star cruise for one night on 29th may 2015 as a grand finale to our tour and was left wondering why we even bothered to go on the noisy and crowded cruise  Check in was super fast and we were allotted a suite on the 46th floor (I think 4664) on the second tower with views of the singapore skyline singapore river and merlion from the sitting room and bedroom windows and the harbour and conservatories of marina bay gardens from the floor to ceiling panoramic windows in the bathroom.  The room was awesome and even the 1900 sq. ft suite we stayed at the Venetian Macau paled in comparison. The furniture, drapings, the bed, the bathroom ..... everything was just WOW. I guess that sums up the room.  We had free access to the club floor and were pleasantly surprised to…",5
"Ok, so I am more of a small-boutique-unique-type-of-a-hotel-person, but of course I dreamed to come to this hotel and make a selfie at the pool:) The water was freezing and there are always millions of people taking pictures. I stayed for two nights and I think I had enough to experience such an enormous hotel. Seriously, when you enter into the first tower it feels that there can be planes flying inside. I really enjoyed my gigantic bathroom and my super king size bed, but I wouldn't call this hotel super cozy. It is definitely nice to experience such a place, but next time I am in Singapore I am staying at a smaller place. Also I think the price is WAY overpriced.",4
"This is quite an experience. The staff are exceptional - but then again that's just the people of Singapore - and the rooms are gorgeous. I was on the 48th floor looking over the Gardens on the Bay and it was a sensational view. The bar on the roof is a great spot for a drink but the pool, although quite amazing, was very busy.  I was here for a conference. If I was travelling for work normally I wouldn't stay here as it is very busy and loud - lots of small children and families. If you are on holiday and want something different then you'll enjoy the experience.",4
"room condition I stayed club room, so it was enough spacious. The bathroom has 2 sinks. If you will accomodate 2 people, you can bathroom easily. Also it has bathtub. Its shower room is situated separately to toilet room.  facilities This hotel is famous for the infinite fool on the top floor. Although you spend time for swimming all  the time, it is not  waste of time.  Also the staff are very nice.  If I go to Singapore again, I will choose this hotel without hesitation.",5
"This hotel is absolutely amazing. When we checked in, the staff were incredibly helpful and evened realised I would be celebrating my birthday during our stay. The gentleman who checked us in organised a fantastic room and cake!!!!! The hotel staff were all so lovely and helpful with helping us organise things such as a trip to the chocolate lounge (which was a fantastic experience in itself). The pool was beautiful and we enjoyed the many cocktails that were served to us with a smile. Breakfast both mornings was fantastic. We were so sad to leave we actually tried to cancel our other accommodation in Singapore so we could stay (unfortunately as it was the week of the SG50, they were fully booked) we will definitely be coming back to stay at MBS",5
"Huge hotel, fast and prompt check in, helpful front desk staff, nice food, nice room, easy access, child friendly and famous pool...My daughter really2 love this hotel and keep me and my wife promise to stay here again on our next trip to S'pore...",5
"My son and I visited in July 2015 and stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel.  We booked a Grand Club Room.  The room itself was spacious (the photo's on the hotel website do not do it justice)  It had a king bed and a sofa bed and we still had plenty of room.  The view from the room was spectacular overlooking the river and city.  We had club privilege's which I would highly recommend.  Not only does the Club Lounge supply breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapes but the staff who work there are excellent.  I would highly recommend staying at this hotel!",5
"Whilst the views are impressive the level of service is absolutely not. As a pregnant person they had very little choice for non alcoholic drinks having run out of most and not having a mocktail list,I ended up paying $8 for a soda which is DISGUSTING!",1
"Lovely property which I just had to stay at before we departed for our cruise. Granted it is a little on the expensive side but on par to what you would probably pay for a stay at Crown Casino in Melbourne. All the amenities you could wish for, each staff member more than happy to help and the view from the top is fantastic. We arrived late afternoon and by the time we made it to the hotel, checked in, changed and went to the top it was dark. As soon as I entered the pool and made my way to the edge a series of fireworks were let off - welcome to Singapore! Can't say much more than it is worth it to stay for at least one night",5
"This must be currently THE most exciting hotel/bulding in the world. Jointly with the park etc a truly amazing experince. The view is breathtaking... It has all the things a good 5 star hotel has and we experinced VERY good service. Expensive stay... but all arround good. However, maybe victim to its own success, the crowds are a pain... pool area is great but only just after noon (check out crowed is gonde) otherwise it is unbaearably crowded, same with restaurants, lobby etc... They do many things right... but for a TRUE luxury experience there are simply to many people (or I guess you have to get the Presidential Suite...)",4
"There are only a few hotels in the world that command the attention of a destination traveler.  The Marina Bay Sands has the perfect location and also the most amazing view of any swimming pool in the world.  If you're ever in Singapore, you shouldn't stay anywhere else.",5
We had a great time at MBS. The breakfast was great and the pool area is awesome. We received a room upgrade which was unexpected with the price we paid. The staff were friendly and service was good to.,5
We stayed here for two nights on our way through the Maldives and were surprised at just how big the hotel was.  Our room was lovely and very spacious - it overlooked the bay and was wonderfuly to sit by the window and watch the light shows at night.  We especially loved going to the pool level and having breakfast and afternoon canapes and drinks. Overall we had a great stay. We wouldnt stay here again only because its pretty pricy and we just treated ourselves that once for our Honeymoon. BUt would recommend to anyone wanting experience a short stay in Singapore.,4
"Let's face it: you can never go wrong with this hotel. Stunning views from both sides of the hotel - so even if the room is not facing the bay and city, the garden view is just as worth it.   Super comfortable rooms, friendly staff, from cleaners, through concierges, to receptionists.... Shopping centre and casino included. The location quality is out of question. So is the Infinity pool. Wow!",5
"This is great iconic hotel. It is worth going just for the photos alone.  It delivers everything you'd expect. We had great rooms, great views and the service throughout our stay was impeccable. The only downside for me was the location of the breakfast. Being in the main lobby it felt a bit like having breakfast in an airport, with large numbers of people milling around just to walk through hotel or visit the shopping mall. It lacked any privacy or intimacy. There is a dining area up on the top floor which serves breakfast. We were invited there on one of our days as the queue for breakfast in the main lobby was really long. This was much more in keeping with a 5 star hotel. Not sure what the criteria is to have breakfast there but it's worth asking.",5
We had a lovely stay at the Marina Bay Sands. We had a deluxe room with city view on the 40th floor which was amazing. The pool was very crowded but still amazing. The staff was very friendly as well ! It was a great stay !,5
"This is our second stay here and the first time it was far more professionally arranged and managed, better service and staff. Now it appears the management team has changed as the services were poor, and our rooms had flaws and we also found the best of the hotel, which was the pool, to be rather 'unclean'.",3
"It’s a five star hotel, and the architecture is something out of a futuristic movie. There is an infinity pool on the top of it (57 floors up) and the views are amazing! Everything in my room is brand new, and the power outlets are built to accept plugs from multiple countries (why doesn’t every hotel do this)? I walk over to this control panel on the wall and immediately press all the buttons…the shades go up, the lights dim, the light outside of my room switches to do not disturb, and the tv comes on. (maybe a bit dramatic, but there were buttons that did things and this made me happy) The bed is super comfortable, the bathroom is huge, I love this place!  There is a mall and a casino in the place, and an pretty awesome botanical garden to take a walk through. It is a bit…",5
"Such a fantastic property, great views either side of all towers, we had a suite to share and it was amazing! Breakfast was great and afternoon drinks were fantastic with that view. Staff were efficient and polite in check in. Definitely recommend travelers to stay at least once during their visit to Singapore",5
Fun and exciting area. Be sure to go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel (the one that looks like a cruise ship in the sky) and have a drink at the infinity pool!  Easy to walk to various areas. Skyline is beautiful,5
Excellent hotel with great views of the Bay Area. The rooftop pool and deck is an great experience. The casino and the shopping centre gives a great opportunity to spend time. Absolutely thrilled with the experience although this was a business trip!,5
"This is a 5-star hotel, and you can really feel the high quality of the hotel and its amenities and the level of excellent service the moment you enter through the doors. We arrived at 07am and they managed to give us a room immediately, even though the regular check-in time is at 3pm, AND this was during high season. We stayed in a room with city view, and I recommend to pay the extra cost of having that. One thing that surprised me was the high number of families with small children at the hotel.   Overall, excellent service and a very beautiful hotel, give you the luxury feeling for your vacation or business trip.",5
"I stayed in the 44th floor. An amazing view into the sea. The room and toilet were extremely neat and clean. Good free WiFi connection too. The infinity swimming pool was smaller in width than my expectation. It was filled with people taking pics and not with many serious swimmers. However, it was an enjoyable experience.",5
"Actually, our visit startet quite well with a small upgrade from the 5th to the 14th floor. The room was nothing special but clean. We had a view to the gardens in tower 1. At the beginnning we were supposed to stay in tower 3 which confused them apparently in a very negative way. We were waiting for about 1h40 in order to get our luggage. Even three phone calls couldn't help. Finally, the bellboy came with our luggage. They had put it three rooms away and they thought we were not in the room...this is simply unacceptable for a 5* hotel. For such a bad situation, I would have expected at least a drink for free, but the only thing we heard was ""we are deeply sorry Ma'am. Maybe it was because we were only backpackers and didn't have Gucci or LV bags...We booked this one night as a…",2
This was my second time to MBS as I wanted my partner to experience the sheer amazement of the sky park and infinity pool. For some reason now the only way to get in here is to stay at the hotel and obviously this is now reflected in the price! We paid the same amount for a base level room this time as I paid for executive level last time ... The complex itself is amazing with the shopping mall featuring the indoor canal and water feature every brand shop you could imagine to indulge yourself and the food court is huge. There is the casino as well but if you like serenity this is not the place it is constant chaos with so many people checking in and out Customer service is a little short on plus everything you purchase is over priced. Worth a look but def not the best Singapore…,2
"This hotel has an amazing wiew, we got the city side and it was beautiful at night. On the other side you can see the botanical gardens. The rooms were nice but the hotel is very crowded, we saw pictures on the roof top pool before traveling and it looked nice, but when we got there it was extremly crowded, even early in the morning. We went for a short swim and figured that we would have lunch on the restaurant at the top, but you had to dress up so we did not bother. There is a huge shopping centre at the bottom if you would like to go there, also a lot of restaurants.",4
"Stayed here with my family over the National Day Parade Preview to catch the fireworks. Unlike my past four staycations at MBS, I chose the city view this time round in order to catch a bird's eye level of the Golden Jubilee fireworks. The view was breathtakingly spectacular.  What sets MBS from most other hotels where I had stayed in Singapore is its impeccable service. From smiling Miki at the check-in counter, the affable and helpful staff at the Club Lounge (Miles and Mirdy) to the prompt service by Vance at check-out, every one along the way treated me and my family like VIPs.  A great way to spend the weekend, and definitely coming back again!",5
"On arrival my wife and i first noticed the long lineup at the check-in counter. Here and there a hotel staff came by and gave us all kind of wifi keys, and papers to fill out. We did not even reach the check.in counter by this time. I felt like a cow on the way to the slaughter house. Just a number, not a person. Once arrived at the check in counter, the hotel staff did not say hello, good morning or anything like that. Just: ""where is your voucher???""  Same thing at the check-out day...no good by no thank you.   The room itselv was OK, but very dirty. We had to call the room service two times to clean up the mess from the previous guests. The minibar was sticky and old juice drops and splashes all over. Also old ""Pringles"" crumps on the floor.. Also the glass table had a broken…",2
"It is really poor experience here. Not recommended. You won't feel you are guest or having vacation.  - Over capacity, full of people. Long queue everywhere. e.g. you have to wait over 15 mins for seat arrangement during breakfast time. You take another 10 mins to store luggage.  - Strong bad smell in the corridor and room (we need to request changing room) - Staff service is poor, lack of smile and even makes us feel rough. (Esp. restaurant) - The buffet breakfast is full of people. When we sit down, I had to sign the bill within 5 mins (I even haven't taken anything). The experience is really poor. The staff is impolite. - The chef is not providing hotel service. They put the fried egg in your dish roughly. Even turn it over.    Not value for money.",2
"The hotel has a very poor service. We stayed there sometime ago, paid tones and received a different room than ordered. Since in was formula 1 period they claimed unavailability and asked us to notify about the issue next time we want to stay for an upgrade. Now as we try to make a reservation they claim lack of availability 7 weeks ahead and nothing can be done. Thats the general approach; never coming forward towards the guest. No effort whatsoever. Always making it a favour. We try to book a restaurant 6 weeks ahead and they tell us its a subject to confirmation. They make a tentative booking and apparently will notify you based on availability. So if there is a customer they value more you can eat a pizza in the mall downstairs... I could understand if the hotel would really…",1
I stayed this cool hotel 5days and I went swimming pool EVERY night. It was best night view ever of my life. even better better better than hongkong one. its not cheap tho but I recommand you to stay at least one night! you will not regret.,5
"Stayed here only 24 hours due to price. Stayed elsewhere in Singapore for remainder of Singapore visit of a week. Cost $520 per night for the cheapest room. The infinity pool with spectacular views was the main attraction, otherwise it's just a hotel & not the best of locations. The Shoppes were high end designer so too expensive, no nearby shops for reasonable prices. Room large and plenty of toiletries. Room quiet. Of concern was the black sooty mould around ceiling in our room (room 311 tower 3), rather off- putting & not expected in this fairly new, high- priced hotel, We did not eat at the hotel due to high prices, instead dined at Fatt Choi Express at attached Casino, for $12.80 each we enjoyed generous steamboats, highly recommended. Also a food court at The Shoppes but a…",3
"Stayed at the Marina Bay sands in 2013.  We were booked in one of the club rooms on the 35th floor with a view of the Singapore skyline.... Just beautiful! I suggest you go for the VIP check in since the hotel is always crowded....the reception area at any given time has more than a 100 people. Our VIP check in took just 5 minutes.  Room--- The room was very comfortable. Bed was great and the bathroom spacious You get access to the roof top dining area if you're booking in a club room...  In the evening you can enjoy the canopy hour with Champagne...that's great and complimentary with the club room My only problem with this property is that its just too impersonal. But then again its one of the biggest hotels, so if you're looking for personalized service choose something…",4
The hotel is amazing fantastic infinity pool and the views are superb. The price is high but the experience is worth it many restaurants close by. I would recommend this hotel for the views and pool and food,5
"Stayed 2 adults 2 kids for 1 night to experience the pool. Free upgrade to the 39 floor. Very busy hotel but check in was fast and staff were very professional and attentive. The pool is amazing and we got our monies worth by going in 3 times , daytime, night time and at 6am . The whole Marina Bay Area is amazing to wonder round and the gardens are really worth a visit ",5
"We decided that we should stay at MBS before we left Singapore, so we booked a mid week ""staycation"" while our apartment was being packed up. We booked a deluxe room and on check-in we were given an upgrade to a simply fantastic room overlooking Marina Bay and the city. The room was huge and the bathroom was absolutely 5 star with a lovely bath and all the trimmings. All the hotel facilities were great and they warned us to expect lines for breakfast downstairs so we opted for in-room breakfast and they brought a table that could be rolled up to the full length window so that I could sit there and admire the view while having breakfast - I don't understand why anyone would not do this and we did it every day we were there. Check-out was superb, there was a queue of course but…",5
"Great hotel, with one of the most amazing pools I've ever seen. The view from the top is simply amazing. The beds are nice, room was nice and the breakfast was lovely. Would have liked to stay there for more than one night. The only downside is the size of the hotel and the price of the rooms.",5
"My family and I stayed for 3 nights in the Orchid Suite. The suite is really big, 100 sqm. Welcome worked very well, Catchup-Service from Airport brought us directly to the hotel where the check-in was made directly in the room. No waiting lines at all as in other comments. Then we went directly to the infinity pool. Really impressing but too many people, all the time! For breakfast we went to the Club, very nice and everything was there. We also tried the afternoon tea which is different than in England, there are just some fruits and sweets. Between 5 and 7 pm, they also serve sandwiches, all for free when staying in a Club room. Overall, you have to see it once but I would not stay here again. Why? Well, I cannot say anything bad about the hotel, it's just to big, to…",3
"Lots of Chinese tourists...It's really overpriced compared to what you get. The room is mediocre at best.   Sure it has the huge infinity pool with amazing view BUT it's always crowded with TONS of tourists. It's like dipping in pee...kinda gross honestly.   But I'm glad I stayed there ONCE. Crossed that off my bucket list.   Tips: If you want to truly enjoy dipping in the infinity pool, go REALLY EARLY. It's completely amazing and that was the only time I actually felt like it's kinda worth it staying at MBS. A lot of other stuff you can enjoy without staying there such as the casino, Ce La Vi etc. The only thing you CANNOT do is pretty much the pool and the room which isn't that cool.",3
"This hotel is amazing. The pool and the view are breathtaking and really unique. Also the gym is on the top and the view is fantastic. I was there for business and I travelled with a group of colleague but it is place that I will visit in the next few years again with my family.  Additional information: I did some massage in the SPA and I can really seggest it. Of course around the street you will find a lot of kind of massage studios that are probably much cheaper, but I preferred the excellent and professional treatment from the hotel. We had also dinner on the restaurant in the top and the food was really good.",5
"We stayed here in Singapore for two nights. Hotel interiors as well as exteriors both are mind blowing.We stayed in the Deluxe room. It had a free wifi.Rooms are very spacious and the major attraction of this hotel is the Infinity Pool, you can actually swim on top of the world.Staff is humble and service turn around time is good.And also to mention you will not get this skyline view from anywhere else. Though the price is little high but one must experience once i lifetime.",4
"The views are great, the rooms are fine, everything is well organised. The prices are high and the attached shopping mall is only ultra luxury so not really interesting. The main issue is that the relaxing areas are very busy so you end up relaxing in your room not at the pool where it can be difficult to get a deck chair or in the bar ( very noisy) or in the main lobby (very few spaces to sit around in). Might be good to expierience it once but do not recommend returning to it",3
"I have been to Marina Bay Sands many times.   It is a huge hotel and quite a piece of architecture.  The pool and observation tower are located on the roof.  If you are a registered guest you have free access to pool and observation tower.  If not a guest, you can pay $20Singapore to go to the observation tower, but no use of the pool.  The check-in can be a slow/laborious task.   Seems rooms are often NOT ready at 3PM check in time.   The que can be long and slow, and the staff will only give a simple 'sorry for the delay'.....no amenities or comps for wasted time.  Buffet dinner in the hotel i$ expen$ive.   $68Singapore dollars to get in.   Found the food only mediocre and not a big choice for such an elaborate hotel!   Minimum stay per night is $368Singapore.    You can find…",3
"This is without doubt one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in, the views and experience from the infinity pool are amazing, as is the uber fresh coconut water! The service is super efficient across the board and the rooms are delightful, spacious, clean and well maintained.",5
"I had booked 2 premier rooms with a city view for my partner and myself and my parents who were visiting us in Singapore from the UK. It was for my 30th Birthday celebrations and I wanted to treat my family. So when we were picked out of the queue and escorted to the VIP Check In I couldn't believe my luck! Then we were very kindly complimentary upgraded to the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE(!) on the 54th floor!! Amazing! This was the luckiest day of my life and I cannot thank the staff at MBS enough for such a special time! The staff were fantastic, gave me a complimentary birthday cake delivered to the room, complimentary mocktails around the pool and couldn't be more generous and friendly. Definitely a stay my family and I will treasure and remember forever. Thank you.",5
"The hotel is spectacular, The pool beautiful and everything was superb, and all of that was spoilt by a faulty light that refused to turn of, A pain that had me SLEEPING IN, I had a schedule of going to Sentosa and experiencing fun and delicious food, BUT WHAT HAD I TO DO, with a faulty light, I expect more from this hotel this expensive. Another con, is that this hotel has become overcrowded and isn't as luxurious as before, when I last went a year before this trip",2
One of my best hotel experience thus far. The view was good and service is excellent. I like the restaurants available there and everything is located nearby. The pool & spa is amazing as well. I will definitely stay again if I am in Singapore.,5
"We had an amazing room in the 46th floor with city view. The room was huge and the view breathtaking.  The main reason to book this hotel was the infinity pool on the roof top. At the pool you only need to watch out not to get hit by a selfie-stick...   We loved the attention and kindness of the staff, which we did not expect when we checked in. The check-in process fitted better to an budget airline than a 5 star hotel.   ",5
"It is cool to stay in this huge hotel, once. We stayed in tower 3 on 50th floor. Great view and room was clean and nice. The pool is also cool with a great view, but crowded. It is so not personal to stay in these big hotels. But you have to do it once. Just for the tick in the box! The few staff you meet are nice, but you hardly meet anyone. Another good thing is that you have subway just under the hotel. Not a good thing is the check in, huge line! It took ages to get a check in. ",3
"We stayed here for two nights at the tail end of a month long holiday.  It was perfect for chilling out and is adjacent all Singapore's new attractions such as the Art & Science Museum and Gardens on the Bay - both of which we spent a bit of time at.  As a family of four we got two adjoining rooms, which gave us lots of space and comfort.  We were up fairly high, with a city-side room, so could avail of the beautiful views and nightly light shows.  The rooftop infinity pool is wonderful, and at 57 storeys has panoramic views of the city state.  The one negative is that this place is extremely busy!  Be prepared for the masses.",5
It was me and my girlfriend who stayed her for the infinity pool. I would say the rooftop bar beside it was awesome and so is the infinity pool. The water is crowded so i recommend for you to early in the morning.  Service was great and our room was clean. Our room had a great view of Downtown Singapore. I would come back and stay again.,5
"We arrived at Marina Bay Sands on the 23rd of July, to stay over till the day after.  It was about noon, and we were weary from travelling. The reception line wasn't too long, luckily, and we got to speak to a cute and friendly receptionist. She asked us whether or not we'd been to Singapore before, what we'd done travelling, etc. After a short chat, she was informed how our family of 5 was split into two different towers of the hotel. With the swipe of a hand, she'd rebooked and upgraded us to the Marina Suite. It did sound great at the time, but exceeded our expectations beyond measure. Not only was it the kind of suite you only see in movies - the service was great aswell. Emplioyees were tiptoed to assist with whatever needed, and were only a button away.   Here's a link to…",5
"A brilliant hotel, enjoyed the Infinity Edge Pool. Stayed here for 10 nights in September last year, for the Grand Prix. Great staff in a prime location. Rooms were fantastic too. Marina Bay is the perfect destination for anyone who loves the vibrancy of the city",5
"We were surprised by the size and quality of the room, and impressed with the view. The pool was good for a brief swim, but there is NO SHADE, so not good for long stints lazing next to the pool.  They are renovating the pool side restaurant area at the moment so maybe there will be more room and more shade in the future. Pool side was a bit noisy from power tools, but the view was so good that you tend to not notice the noise pollution (and obviously this will presumably be temporary). Some of the pool side staff were great, but others a little too enthusiastic (ie: almost pushy) about asking if you want food or drink. I was really surprised by how large the room and bathroom area was. The bathroom area was actually 3 separate rooms: a Large sink and bath area, a toilet room…",5
We stayed in a room in Tower 2 with fantastic views of the city. The Infinity pool and the spa on the roof top were just amazing. The views were spectacular. The staff were very helpful and polite. Would love to stay here again.,5
"Our second time staying here and it won't be our last. Amazing pool, rooms, views, facilities and customer service. Every staff member that we have come across have all been excellent - I don't know what other people are complaining about! The only letdown was that the gym has been downsized. I guess there must not be too many people using it.   We were given an early check-in  and the highest level for the premier rooms on level 47 the views were amazing! ",5
"The room is nice spacious and well equipped. We felt comfortable. Tower 2 on the 50th floor gave us a nice view over the bay. However a very big hotel thus lack of a personalised service worth of a 5 star and alot of people.The staff taking care of the swimming pool entry need to be more customer service oriented, as they seem to be bouncers sometimes a bit rude.",3
Besides the rooftop pool the hotel is not that special for a five star hotel. The marina bay sands was a must do for us when we visited Singapore. But to be honest I'd book an other hotel with a fairer price. Breakfast was too expensive as well. Room was okay but the bathroom smelled a little awkward. ,3
"We stayed at Marina Bay for 2 nights. The reception we received by the staff was very reserved and distant, but the room was truly beautiful, decorated and equiped to a very high Standard.  Of course, as everyone who books Marina Bay, we were looking forward to a nice afternoon at the pool with spectaculous views. However, it came with many strings attached. It was impossible to find a free sun bed (generally every day after 4pm), the space was very limited, nowhere to sit or put your belongings, pool overcrowded so much that it felt like a free public pool and apart of screaming asian kids (dont even mention the chinese boy urineting at the lift on the floor), there was a drilling noise during our entire stay due to the renovation works at Tower 2. Overall, unfortunately, the…",3
"This is my second time in marina bay sands. The last time I visited it was like 5yrs ago. Comparing it before and now is quite different.  Too long que for check in, alot of people are roaming in the lobby, it doesn't look like a hotel anymore, the ambiance was lost, it looks like more of a meeting place. We booked premier room on higher floor. But in fairness the room is well maintained. The staff are courteous specially the concierge staff. The infinity pool is too crowded also, you'll having a second thought for hygienic purposes, even at night it's too jam packed.   Since, it's still one of the most looked after hotel at Singapore a lot of people would still like to try to experience the sands accommodation but you can get a cheaper five star hotel and a better and more…",3
"Amazing views, however went on Saturday night and had over 40min wait in line to get elevator done.  This was annoying",4
"The hotel is extremely nice and luxurious, the pool is a great experience but i was really disappointed with the service. The staff is not friendly and the service is very slow. I can understand that the hotel is huge and crowded but still it isn't and excuse for having a bad service like no one answers you for what you want especially when our suite was smelling cigarettes, we called the reception so many times until someone came to spray our room. Such a nice hotel should have a great service to have an overall amazing experience.. ",3
I had to visit singapore for work purpose. I took a day off to have a look at the famous Marina bay sands & look what i found?! The view was breathtaking i was spellbound!!!  In love with this place. Gonna come with my wife for holidays soon <3 marina bay sands offers the best view of the city,5
"We had no idea that we booked our stay during SG50, and what a wonderful experience and suprise it was to visit Singapore during this time.  We booked a deluxe room online but at check in we were upgraded to the Orchard Suite facing the city and Merlion Park. The suite was absolutely AMAZING!!! We were in Tower 3 on level 51.   The suite had a large bathroom with walk in shower and a seperate toilet. Mirrored hallway. A large walk in wardrobe!! Separate living room area, an office desk in another area and a large area for the king sized bed.   The floor to ceiling windows that stretched the entire length of the suite was incredible for the view of the city, and what a treat it was to watch the SG50 fireworks that night from the comfort of our room. Uninterrupted views and…",5
The room i got too small but we've experience the pool. The staf so nice. C/in & c/out also no hard. We got botanical view. The bathroom ok. the hotel far from restaurant. Need walk too long. Should hv all promotion room with free breakfast. Should hv kids playground.,5
Great service. Nice big rooms. Breathtaking views of Singapore harbour. Then the infinity pool is another brilliant experience too. You feel good going into the pool when others who are not hotel guests are cordoned off. We felt very privileged indeed. Highly recommended for at least one visit in your life.,5
We got room on 29th floor facing garden by the bay it was good view of the garden and the sea at night  one night is not enough if you any one planning for it at least 2 night  view from the pool is awesome spl the sun setting down behind the sky line of city   As read in TA there was no problem checking and check out  it was done with in mins  Below the hotel it has casino and shopping u get everything you need in that mall,5
"2nd time staying in MBS, nothing changed just that the pool area is undergoing some major renovations when i stayed there, its the Jacuzzi area overlooking gardens by the bay. Steam room was also undergoing renovations. Well, better luck next time!   Pool area is crowded, kinda expected it. Staff by the pool were attentive enough to attend to us when we needed the menu, service was pretty good.   Room was spacious, we stayed in a premier room on level 47, city view. Housekeeping was good, requests were attended to swiftly!   Overall it was good!",4
"Stayed two nights in a City view Club Room. Check in was fairly easy although extremely busy. Our room was not ready on arrival, which we did not expect anyway as we were early (11:00am) but our luggage was stored for us and sent to our room as soon as it was available. Our room was 3669 in tower 2, right at the end of the building with a fantastic view over the city and an awesome view of the gardens from the bathroom. The room is very spacious with a TV mounted on a swivel stand separating the bed from the lounge area, 4 seat dining table, two 2 seater lounges and an armchair with ottoman and desk with travel adapters and Internet connection. The bathroom is quite large, twin bowl vanity, large  separate  shower, free standing bath and view to die for. As part of the Club Room…",5
"What i liked best: the pool was really something else and very nice. plus the fact that atleast we got our accomodations at discounted rate. but will never check in there again at full price as we do not feel the value for money   What i didn't like the most: yeah the pool is very nice... BUT there was a terrible reek coming from the pool plus the trickery in the mini bar/fridge-Be careful travelers, once you take out the contents in the fridge it is considered used/consumed and will be charged as incidentals. you have to pay an additional $10 for a personal fridge for drinks/food you want to keep cool.  service: Service is just right. not good but not great either room: our room was huge and really nice. Bathroom was huge  & clean. location: great location nice city view from…",2
"our family stayed in the hotel for 3 days. The hotel and the surrounding area  is good but service and the staff at the hotel are unacceptable! the breakfast is nice but very crowded and noisy The  front desk and all other staff are not providing service, whatever you need or ask the answer is always NO. when you pay more than 800USD per night! You can get better hotels for lowers prices, only if you want to see unique pool that's very nice pool. But you have decide by yourself whether the value is right for you. we recommend everybody to skip this hotel and save your money! Please consider whether your money is valuable for your stay in Singapore.",1
"If you like to travel and want to see something magnificent , you have to stay in Marina Bay Sands at least once, just for experience. The pool on the roof is like nothing you have seen before. The view of the city is spectacular. Some people wrote that customer service was very bad. As for us, we were treated very good by all the staff. We were given a huge 1 bedroom suite on a high floor with a fantastic view  instead of a standard room that we booked  at absolutely no charge, because all regular rooms on high floors were occupied. There was a storm at night and we could not sleep good  because of the banging noise to the window. Next day when we told the staff about this problem , we were offered a free breakfast on the roof immediately. They really care about their…",5
"I only went there for the infinity pool, which is amazing and didn't fail to fascinate me ; the view from there is breathtaking! The water is clean and the service is good, the hotel is extremely modern. I'll definitely come back again.",5
"everything was smooth upon check-in we didn't have to wait too long for our room which is a good sign though.of course we came in almost like in the afternoon into our room, we are pretty exhausted so we took a nap and after that we went up to the pool around 5pm expecting that it's not too hot to swim. upon reaching to the top, we were surprised that the pool was crowded really really crowded, but still we were able to find our spot, we sat and relaxed for a while then the skies got dark like it was about to rain. before it rains we decided to have some snacks by the pool. I approached one of the male staff there i was insisting to order food but he was like chasing us away only because it was about to rain. I still insisted but he became rude and showed me his nasty face. I…",4
"Had an amazing 3 nights here at start of our honeymoon. Had an amazing city view from  40th floor room and was very spacious. Rooftop pool and bars amazing , also only place we could feel a breeze in Singapore lol.",5
"Dear visitor to Singapore,  Please consider whether your money is valuable for your stay in Singapore. The facility is quite nice but service in hotel is two or three star class. The reservatiom and front desk are not commucating eachother and brought us a lot confusion.  Non smoking floor is ignored by the guest and smoke on club level floor which you pay more than 800SGD per night. That's you can get for 100 SGD and lesser in Singapore as well. Only if you want to see infinity pool that's very nice pool. But you have decide by yourself whether the value is right for you. This will be my last (third) visit to MBS.  Have a nice day",1
"We stayed at the hotel just after New Years and enjoyed our stay. The room we had was brilliant, nice and high up with great views over Singapore. Facilities in the room were high tech and it was very large, spacious and comfortable. I guess this can be expected from one of the best developments in the world!  Check in was a process though, there are many people staying here and it gets crowded. The drivers coming in to the driveway are stressed and there is a flash of confusion as your bags are taken and you are left to find out which queue of the many long queues you need to line up at. Fortunately we were identified and taken from the queue for VIP check in though if we were to wait longer in the queues like many people would have to we would have been more frustrated. …",4
"one of the main reasons for visiting singapore was to see this pool which is pretty amazing and worth the visit.  never seen so many selfie sticks in my life. the location is quick to the airport and you can walk right out to the cloud forest. the hotel is very nice but staying there is expensive both from the nightly cost and food, etc. I think you could find some cheaper places to eat in the attached mall, but in the end just budget for spending more money at the hotel and enjoy it. its really nice and worth staying there.",5
"Booked a week in MBS but checked out early because we did not find it to be a good value.  It should definitely be experienced because the rooftop infinity-edge pool is astonishing.  You can do that on a day pass, though, and save plenty of money.  We stayed on the club level and enjoyed attentive service with a very good breakfast, fruit and pastries for tea, and a free-flowing cocktail hour.  Although crowded, the staff handled the challenge admirably.  Downstairs, however, it was crowded and chaotic as the hotel was booked to capacity.  The concierge was overwhelmed and a bit brusque but truly it was a sea of people with a barrage of questions.  Skip the dinner on the top floor; the food is nothing special and the prices astronomical.  If you definitely check it out, though,…",3
The view from the top was very good that is if you can fight your way through the crowds! Expensive for what it was. Use the Singapore  Flyer instead,2
"The best in class hotel with well equipped room,amazing view from balcony, courteous staff, nice bathroom and last but not the least Awesome Pool...Hotel has every charm to keep you busy admiring it. Loved to be here..",5
"Another top place to stay whilst visiting Singapore, awesome views from the roof top pool. Rooms were clean and tidy, possibly a tad difficult to find our room because of the share size of this facility, we found ourselves in the wrong lift of many lifts within the three towers however that was just apart of the experience and besides we got to see more of this grand attraction. Moments away from the casino if you like a bunt or just to watch and soak up the atmosphere. I would definitely like another visit to this establishment as it was on the verge of being completed when I stayed, would definitely advise a stay at MBS it will be a worthy stay even for a king.   ",4
"... it's definitely too crowded up there even if the view from the pool is breathtaking, particularly at night. Clubrooms are spacious but the club facilities and the food/drinks didn't wow us. Good for a stopover stay but not for a longer visit. Consider it an attraction on your sightseeing list but not much more.",4
"It was good and beautiful pool on the top. It's so beautiful and fantastic! However, our room had some problems:(   The bathroom door wasn't closed and  the curtain was broken :(   After that they fixed it. But not so quick... If there was no pool, it's worthless:( sorr",3
"Booked this for our last night of our backbagger honeymoon, one reason for being the infinity pool, experience and good rest before travelling back home. We came here with backbags but were welcomed as friendly as others. The hotel is of course very fancy and shiny with many high-end stores. We had a room on 42nd floor and it was obviously clean, neat and spacious. Bathrooms I've seen better but the bed and sheets were probably the best I have slept in. Nice view to Gardens by the Bay from the balcony. Breakfast was not included in the room price and we did not bother to buy it separately for its ridiculous price (48SGD).  Infinity pool I must say was a bit of a disappointment. Beautiful and glorious surroundings with a spectacular view, sure, but full of people, kids and selfie…",4
"I stayed here as a treat with my sister towards the end of 6 months of travel. Yes it is pricey but I can wholeheartedly say it was worth every penny we paid. We paid for a club upgrade which included all manner of wonderful extras which really made the experience incredible. We of course got a club room and were able to check in earlier and quicker allowing us extra time to visit the pool. We had afternoon tea at 2pm and then cocktails and canapés from 5-7pm. The title for both of these things do not do them justice, it was like a gourmet tasting session with as much food as you can manage. The drinks included everything from champagne to cognac, as much as you like in the 2 hours. The staff in the club restaurant made the experience even more special for us; Naveen and him…",5
"We had a week here. I wanted to experience the infinity pool.  I have to say. From arriving at the hotel to leaving we had a superb stay. The room was lovely, with a spectacular view over the Gardens by the bay.  Breakfast was amazing. Indescribably amazing. Needs to be experienced...  The pool was great, only drawback was that it was super crowded every time we tried to go.  Checkin and checkout was painless even if it is a huge hotel.  What impressed me the most was the fact that the staff recognized us, and made us feel special.  I gave to mention Mozza, an Italian restaurant. It actually served the best pizza I ever tasted, including the ones I had in Italy. We went back the last evening, and was recognized, greeted like old friends, they remembered it was our last night,…",5
"Modern hotel with great view of Singapore bay. Best hotel for solo, couple and family so far in singapore. You can enjoy infinity pool at the top floor. Best time the afternoon to evening so you can see the sunset from there.   Many places to go if you like night life. Also close by Marina Bay Mall where you can find the branded product and romantic dinner with by the bay view.",4
What an amazing place. The Marina Bay Sans Hotels tops off the wonders of Singapore. Views right around Singapore and of the ships in the strait.,4
Marina Bay Sands has to be one of the finest properties I've ever visited. Amazingly beautiful sunset and night time views from the pool. I laid by the pool from mid afternoon till late that night and enjoyed every second of the changing views. Look forward to returning one day :),5
"Best hotel in Singapore to stay, located in the city centre lots of shopping malls in the close vicinity, club house on the top floor with amazing swimming pool ,breathtaking views from the top floor club. Can enjoy water show in the evening, casino and shopping inside the hotel.",5
"MBS is all about the bragging rights. ""Whoo Hoo, I stayed at Marina Bay Sands!""  And I was no exception to this pretense. I rather enjoyed bragging to my friends that I was staying here on the heals of my husband who was speaking at the RSA Security conference in June. I just love it when I get to tag along! This is a beautiful hotel but make no mistake, it’s not for your average Grizwald family vacation. Everything is extremely expensive because it's a business hotel for business travellers who are able to expense a $48 buffet breakfast or a $30 domestic cocktail, $12 plain bagel, or an 8 dollar yogurt cup The hotel's main claim to fame is the rooftop infinity pool, and you've probably seen viral pics of this hotel, taken by professional photographers that show beautiful people…",4
"We didn't stay in the hotel, which looked incredible but very full. But the views from the skywalk at the top are quite simply breathtaking and watching the sunset over the city, and being there when the city lights up is an absolute must for travellers",5
This hotel is a Landmark in Singapore. We stayed here for 2 nights for a room rate much higher than many other luxury downtown hotels. Check-in was smooth but took sometime due to the number of guests for this large hotel. Service was outstanding. Everything was coordinated very smoothly. My luggage was waiting for me near the room before I arrive. The hotel is directly linked to a shopping mall with many designer stores and variety of restaurants and cafes. The Sky Park and the infinity pool at the roof top are another reason for making this hotel a must-visit. The breakfast is served at the ground floor with wide selection of food and efficient staff to serve a huge number of guests. Marina Bay Sands has its own identity and is highly recommended for a short visit to Singapore.,4
"Wanted to get this off my bucket list and in order to fully experience what the hotel has to offer,  we decided to stay here for 3 nights in our 7 days Singapore vacation trip.   We booked the Garden view primarily for its balcony.   You don't have to worry about the city view pictures coz you will have access to the Skypark Observation and take your city view photos from there.   Our room was at tower 3 in the 45th floor and the views from the rooms were great.  Since the access to the infinity pool and Skypark is at tower 3 it was very convenient for us.   The room in itself is not that special and for me the bed and pillow was not that comfortable but the great view at the balcony makes up for it.   The infinity pool was always crowded on all the 3 nights we went in there. …",5
"This malay guy namely Asyraf is a very rude staff in marina bay sands nearby river boat and casino. First I saw him make face to the customer when customer ask him thats why I as the other one and not him but what he did is he interrupted us and told the lady that she has a phonecall but the lady answered him that nobody on the line then he laughed so he only wanted our conversation to finish then I ask his name and surname. He told me in a very rude way that he dont have a surname. You shouldnt hire this type of attitude to be a concierge because he dont to handle customer, he must work only in coffee shop or clean toilet in dormitory not in this line specially in marina bay sands. I hope you should take action to this matter so that it will not happen again. Please send him…",2
"Stayed here last May 2015. The room is very big with amazing view, bathroom is very nice. Last but not least is the legendary stunning pool! Its the most spectacular pool with spectacular view :) definitely will go back there !",5
"Booked 1 week prior was great that we can get the room with a pretty much good deal in terms of money. Room was good, everything works and the pool was awesome just like what u expected. Spent the night at the bar side the pool with tge skyscrapers view from the top of the city is the plus point. Average points for the food, didn't worth it with the price, don't expect personalized service because they are too busy with bunch of people. U get what u paid, do not expect flawless service.",3
"One of the best, if not the best, 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in! Rooms are spacious, with nice beds and are well maintained. Plenty of facilities for both adults and kids. The room-top pool is a must-go place. Enjoy the excellent view, especially during night time, while you are taking a leisure swim. Service is good, though the staff need to smile more. Lots of good restaurants available; you are spoit for choice when it comes to food. Location is good, being well connected to a train station. Verdict: I'll be back!",5
"I made a reservation for a room for New Years Eve period and had to cancel it five whole months in advance. I am pretty sure, there are lots of people who would love to take this room but the hotel refuses to accept a cancellation and does not refund a penny. I am very interested, what my Singapore friend will find out, when checking on New Years Eve. I am pretty sure, they rented the room again. Nobody wants empty rooms on New Year and in conclusion emtpy tables in the restaurant. That's definitely not what you expect in this league of hotels. Very disappointed !",1
"We arrived to a nice greeting, very speedy processing at check in and the bags were speedily sent up to the room. This was all despite us arriving about 4 hours before check in time which is supposed to be 3pm. We booked an ocean facing room which is cheaper than the ones facing the Marina. Upon placing the key in the slot inside the door, the curtains open to reveal what was a beautiful view so if you're concerned whether to pay extra for the Marina/city view, don't be, the ocean view is also great. Also the rooms are huge with plenty of space to spread out, even with our little one in a roller bed.  The pool is a selfie festival. People clamoring over themselves and others to take the best selfie. Whilst somewhat entertaining, it's not relaxing and of course actually getting…",4
We were there for just one night and upon walked in to the lobby we were shocked by how many people in there. Some even wearing there bathrobe!!! We were very lucky that we were greeted by a gentleman and escorted is to the VIP check in. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite!!! Walked in to the suite was another shock! The room is excellent. good size with excellent view of the harbour!!! KIds able to run around and having good time! We went to the Infinity pool and there are so many people there that kind of put us off. I guess this is their signature pool and this is a must visit for hotel guests! We done a express check out which is very good. Save our time lining up! When we get home we got the email from the hotel on regards of our hotel bill. We were charge a red bull and…,4
"This hotel is so huge that you can probably get lost the first time you arrive. This is truly one of the best places to stay in Singapore, although it could be a little pricey.  The views is so nice, but the pool area can be a little overcrowded at times. The hotel is near to the Marina Bay Casino, (just downstairs) Room size is great and clean, service was ok...  Will come back again.",4
"If you are to stay in this hotel make sure that you get the Club room access. We initially planned on staying here for the Infinity Pool but this hotel has a lot more to offer. The Club on 55th floor served outstanding food & drinks. In our package, we are also entitled to have b'fast at Sky on 57. We also chose to stay here for we watched the premier of Singing in the Rain at the Grand Theater. Best location for it is just walking distance to the Gardens. Congratulations to the MBS team for every staff made us feel welcomed and everything we asked for was actioned promptly.",5
"We recently stayed at this Hotel. What an amazing experience!! Everything about this place is stunning, the architecture, the staff, the decor.....wow. The highlight for us was the free upgrade to the 54th floor suite which is normally $16,000 USD/night.....this was such an exceptional experience and one I wont forget. I cannot say enough about this Hotel.....it was simply sublime!!",5
The hotel offers everything you need for a memorable holidays. Food on the hotel is fantastic and the buffet dinner is a must try with fantastic spread . The hotel also offers shopping around the complex and don't miss the award winning pool deck on the top floor with exhilarating view ,5
"The hotel has an interesting design, looking like a boat on top of three columns. It stands out from almost anywhere in the city with its modern and unique design. As such, being so huge the hotel room we stayed in had great views of the city and the nightly laser lights show. We payed an extra $50 a night to stay in the city view room, which is regrettable later as you can go to the rooftop and see everything anyway not to mention the fact that you don't spend that much time in the room anyway.  The room overall was massive, very spaceous. The mini bar was rigged, do not touch anything in there at all or you will be charged even if you don't drink it! The most time was spent up at the pool, it was absolutely gorgeous, great views and pool concept. There is plenty of seating…",4
"I really feel that staying at this hotel was one of the highlights of our Singapore vacation. We chose MBS to spend our long overdue anniversary celebration. I booked a deluxe room but did not get the expected room, instead we got something more. Upon check-in, a staff member named Tan Jun Sheng, SJ (Front Office Supervisor) assisted us. He was very friendly and helpful. When I presented the copy of our hotel voucher he took the time to read my requests. I requested for a higher floor to get a nice view of the city. After a short while, he told us that our room was ready and expedited our check-in. The front desk who received us, told us that they upgraded our room for free. We got the clubroom upgrade at the 39th floor plus a city view. Not just that, our room was decorated…",5
The otel great. Our room was very nice scenery . We stayed on 39. floor. Gardens by the bay was the view of our room and Singapure flayer :) Room very big:) The pool is excellent. But there are many children. The meals were very good. The price of food is not expensive. The hotel is very nice with everything. The staff are very good and very polite. Everything about it helped a lot. I think you should stay at this hotel in Singapore;),5
"We were here in June 2015.  Location - good. All taxis know Marina Sands. Easy to get around.  Hotel -  generally no complaints about the hotel and facilities.  Il like the fact that shopping is very  convenient.   We would like to bring up an incident where our family member slipped and fell outside the lift due to the wet floor .  This is because some of the guests were dripping wet (from the pool) when they entered into the lift. Its something that the hotel should look into this. Perhaps the hotel could also notify the guests to be properly towel dried  after getting off the pool. We have reported this issue to one of the hotel staff.   The buffet spread is very generous. However, we note that some guests waste food.We wonder how you could stop this wastage.   The reception…",3
"We wanted a four day relax after a month of travelling. Couldn't be happier that it was at this hotel. Staff were always polite, smiling and helpful. Our suite was awesome, HUGE!! with breathtaking views of harbour and city. The pool area although busy is easy to get a spot if you go up between noon and 3 pm. The water temperature is just perfect. It is easy to get around from here as well. There is always taxis and they are inexpensive. Would recommend to anyone.",5
Great roof top pool. Really huge. Nice view from the pool over Singapore. Breakfast  in the restaurant next to the pool was so so. Room was very nice with great view over a very futuristic park. It is a huge hotel so if you are looking for a cosy place do not go. It is spectacular though.,4
"The rooftop swimming pool like a super market that all the housewives were trying to get the cheapest food from the shelf. In the swimming pool, all the people tried to find the best location to take pictures. You can see no one really ""swimming"" there, but everyone take their camera or selfie stick to take pic for two or three hours. We tried to stay on the edge just want to enjoy the view of Singapore, however, people tried to push you because they wanted to take million pics on the edge as well. The pool is like Singapore - hard to make you relax.  The water of the swimming pool: SO DIRTY, you can see the dead skin flowing in the swimming pool. It seems no one clean the water, so even the next morning (6am), you can see all the dirty things on the surface.  The room was…",4
"I stayed her in a room with city view with two children, age 4 and 6, for three nights. We had ordered a room with garden view at the internet page of the hotel. However, it was troublesome to order one room for all four. When we arrived we got the explanation that we could have this room with city view with one kingsize bed and a sofa-bed. That was ok for us to sleep on. Should we have a room with garden view we the room would contain two extended single beds. So we kept the room with city view.  The best with this hotel is the infinity pool. The view is spectacular! The children love it! Also the fireworks.  However, you don't get a feeling of being special at this big hotel. When we were there, the hotel was almost full (there are 2561 rooms).  The breakfast had a very large…",3
"Good service, lunch buffet was good quality as expected, the pool was awesome to be up on the sky amongst the skyline.. Annoying that each person needed a pass to gain access. The property is a little overrated but still a good experience.",5
"We had our last 2 night of 9 night in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands, as great end to our stay.  I would recommend upgrading to the Ocean View room with Club Lounge included as it allowed us to relax and take in all of the views of Singapore with wonderful food. Truly wonderful experience and we will now be staying their on our next return.",5
"For a hotel that is associated with a five star rating it exhibited service that was meager compared that of even a motel. The service was a disgrace. Every aspect of the hotel was not only overpriced but underwhelming. This hotel is nothing more than scam with a boat on top. The level of hospitality (or lack there of) that the staff exhibited was the worst that I have ever experienced. The overcrowded pool was nothing more than a selfie-stick playground that hindered the only complimentary part of the despicable hotel, the view.",1
"First of all, it should be mentioned that if you want to stay here be ready to mingle with people in the atrium who have come to get the perfect picture here.  Yes; as some previous reviews say it is busy and noisy in the atrium but we were only there to check in/out and go to the MRT.  We arrived at 12pm wanting to store our luggage but were able to check in AND were upgraded to a studio suite (very much appreciated).  The check in system is flawless and yes you have to queue but the staff even apologise if you wait 5mins!!!  We were on the 51st floor and had a stunning suite, views and every amenity you could wish for.  The pool was busy but there are sections for adults and children only so not sure why some people would complain about kids being in the pool - they have their…",5
"Let me start off by saying that the manager Dax (forgot his last name) was amazing, he took excellent care and catered to us. My issue was that three people were staying in my room, I paid for an extra bed but to get a key for that third person, I had to pay for that as well. In short, everyone has to get a key in order to enjoy the infinity pool on the 57th floor. There's an area for adults only, and the lifeguards did their best to get rid of the kids but the parents were horrible and didn't obey the rules. There was one kid who stood in front of us, took off all his clothes, changed into his bathing suit while his mother took selfies. Lol! The hotel has lots of restaurants, access to the train station and a mall complete with ice skating and a casino. The rooms and bathrooms…",4
Grt hotel to be there. What architecture my god. Three 57 storey towers connected by a ship on it. And the swimming pool on the top of it. My god amazing. Rooms are bigger than pan pacific just like the venetian macau.as it is of the same group the property is also exclusive. With all facilities in it and a bathtub in the rooms we stayed it was a grt exp.very expensive hotel but the food is cheaper. They have very good indian food like chappatis heeng dal veg fried rice which tastes deliciously. And to our utter surprise not so costly indian food. Room had all facilities with unlimited mineral water which is more essential. So overall a grt stay and a fantabulous holiday at marina bay sands. A full fledged casino with a shopping complex. Driven a ferrari there which was worth…,5
"We spent 2 nights in MBS end of June. We were expecting to stay in a sort of mega luxurious temple. 1st impression was already negative when, when we arrived for the checkin, we had to queue quite a while, à-la Disneyland.  Then, our room was showed to us. Quite nice, but nothing outstanding. We were very curious to see the infinity pool on the roof top, worldwide famous. Again, massive deception. Trashy impression, too busy, too loud, a little dirty. At least, the view was as expected. The pool area was under construction, hopefully for a good result. Being used to high end hotels, mainly in Dubai, this place is far from the level of its Emirati competitors. ",2
"We felt that the outside of the hotel far outweighs the interior.  The external view of the hotel is amazing. However the interior is quite sterile.  The lobby feels like a shopping mall. The club bedroom was nice,  but quite bland. The pool is fantastic but marred by people spending too much time with selfie sticks. We managed to swim lengths though.  The food in the club room was lovely as are the staff. They made sure that we took full advantage of the available food and alcohol which did surprise us. Was glad we paid for the club as we think if we had booked a standard room without all the inclusive extras we would have been disappointed.  We stayed at the Shangri la tanjung aru in Borneo a few years ago and this far eclipsed Marina Bay Sands in presentation and services.…",4
"Many people come here for the pool -- they won't be disappointed. Pool is open from 6 am til 11 pm, and stays open in all but during the worst weather. It's not so crowded in the early morning, then picks up a bit in the late morning. I'd avoid early afternoon as it can be really hot, and the poolside offers little shade. It gets crowded mid afternoon and stays so.  Lifeguard does a pretty good job of keeping the kids out of the adults-only section, so it's not so loud. As expected pool will be filled with tourists toting selfie sticks.  As for the hotel itself, it's quite modern. Rooms have automatic blinds/curtain that draws open/close as you unlock/lock the room door. Beds are comfortable and the bathroom is also first-rate.  Hotel let us check-in early (around 1:30 or so)…",5
"The basic hotel infrastructure is good but the implementation is just terrible.   The lobby is noisey but there are a lot of receptionists so it clears quite fast. The room I was given is on the third storey and faces the expressway and Gardens by the Bay. If you sit on the verandah, you can smell the fumes from the cars. At 6am, after a late night, I was woken up by the loud-hailers from en event at either the Marina or Gardens by the Bay. This is NOT funny.   Everytime we open the door to our room and look downstairs it is teaaming with people. Even for breakfast, the coffeeshop downstairs has a line of people and because of the open oncept, all the noise floats up   The main reason that you would choose to stay here is for the famous infinity pool that has been featured in…",2
"This is an amazing hotel---and def worth paying extra for (even for just one night) just to get into the pool! Staff on check in were lovely!---a young man checked us (no idea his name, but he was just about to go on holiday himself to Iceland). ----really nice manner. We hyad booked this as a treat for our family and it was a wonderful ending to the holiday!",5
"I was at this hotel on business. The room is spacious and very well organized, many electrical outlets, and curtains and lights remotely controlled from the bed side table. The view from the roof top bar is fantastic. One should go there before ten in the evening otherwise there is a line. The infinity pool was somewhat disappointing, rather small and very crowded. The service was very good.",4
"We booked a Club Room with City View for our stay at the hotel and quite frankly, we found the hotel to be very disappointing. It is very much like going to Disneyland. It is a very big hotel and the crowd was simply overwhelming. We queued at check-in, at breakfast time and at check-out ! They even have crowd controllers managing queues at all of the places mentioned  whose priorities are anything but to  treat us like hotel guests. As for the pool, it is extremely busy day and night, and you certainly cannot swim from one end to the other without bumping into selfies sticks and Go-Pro cameras. Oh yes, banana lounges are prized commodities so hang on to them if you happen to be at the pool. As for our Club Room, it is sparsely furnished, and the decor looks like something out…",2
"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands for one night in order to access the infinity pool on the 57th floor was well worth it for us! We live in Singapore so we weren't planning on doing any sightseeing just spending the whole afternoon and early evening at the pool.   We stayed in a club room on the 46th floor with an amazing view of Gardens by the Bay. You can watch the super trees light show from the balcony in  your room.   Bathroom was huge with a very large walk in shower area, double sinks, separate toilet, and a huge bathtub.  Breakfast at the club lounge on the 57th floor was very good and not overly crowded.  The pool was definitely crowded. We were able to check in early and it seemed like a good time to visit the pool on a weekday was between 1 and about 3:30 pm - in…",5
"MBS does a great job of keeping up the standards of the hotel consistently. Clean rooms and impeccable service from the staff as usual. However, removing the free hotel shuttle to/from the airport was a let down.",5
"presidential suite no 5138 has high quality fittings and interiors , media room , personal office, gym, massage room , kitchen ,massive masterbed and kids room with spacious bathrooms ,a baby grand piano, above all the amazing city view from all the rooms from 51st floor. checked in early by 3hours , checked out late by 1 hr ,however the infinity pool was crowded at 5 to 7 pm, express checkout was convenient. what impressed me was i had left my sunglasses behind ,which they found later and shipped back to me in india .we will definitely be back when in singapore next.",5
"Marina Bay Sands is the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  ""Never Settle"", David Beckham says, and with Marina Bay Sands, you feel like you're far from settling.  The room we stayed at was gorgeous with views of the bay and the city.  The hotel is connected to the MRT which is convenient for getting anywhere in the city.  In fact, the hotel is situated within walking distance to many shops, a casino, and Gardens by the Bay, a main tourist attraction in Singapore.  The best part about the hotel is the infinity pool.  Even though it is crowded throughout the day, you are always able to get your own spot for nice pictures.  Anyone who is visiting Singapore should book at least one night at Marina Bay Sands as the pool with its amazing view is worth the hotel fare alone.  I will…",5
"This hotel is beautiful, and we were even treated to a free upgrade! Great start! The pool is stunning, well worth the view.  I would have given four stars but it's let itself down on the customer service aspect. Once I'd checked out, after settling all bills - they then took an extra couple of hundred dollars out of my account! I've sent numerous emails and a copy of my bank statement but no one is getting back to me. Obviously this has now affected my onward travel and it's very unprofessional from such a prestigious hotel.  So be warned of this if you don't have any extra money to be losing to this hotel!",2
Have now stayed 3 times at MBS and love the resort with it's amazing roof-top facilities. However must say that on my most recent stay have noticed that the rooms are starting to look a bit tired and with room rates rising are not the same value as they were 12 months ago,5
Just an amazing experience. The infinity pool was amazing. The food at the club was amazing. The hotel itself was jaw dropping. The views were just divine. The staff were friendly. The location was amazing. The money you spend is worth every cent. Rates are not cheap. No other hotel I have stayed in even comes close to this.,5
"We have visited this hotel as we were attracted by its pool, and by the tropical paradise image that was portrayed on its website. Unfortunately reality was sadly far from publicity, and we faced a disastrously handled pool where management is only interested in thouroughly checking your entitlement as a guest to access the area but then nothing is done to ensure the comfort of guests. The pool was terribly overcrowded by extremely noisy people behaving on the edge of disorderly conduct, without a lifeguard in sight (his chair was empty during the whole time we were there). All beach chairs were taken, either by people or by casually abandoned towels that nobody bothered removing. We managed to take two seats almost outside the pool area and near a noisy ventilation duct, but…",2
"Beware of highway noise, at least on lower floors. The view from the pool is nice, but the pool itself is just so so. You can't swim. Overall, it's a huge hotel but not so nice. I would not rate it 5 stars.",2
An amazing hotel that is mind blowing from A to Z. Just a great expirience to spend a few days in Singapore and use this hotel as your base camp. In all options it was a perfect stay. There is nothing to comment negative at and the roof top is a must see at night!,5
Everything was great! The staff are amazing:) the infinity pool is awesome! We love it! If you stayed in the hotel you can access the view deck for free as well. You will not get bored because the Mall is just at the ground floor. Our room was overlooking the famous Garden by the bay😊,4
"My partner and I stayed in Singapore for 2 nights at Marina Bay Sands. This hotel was incredible from the moment we walked in. Short drive from the airport. We had stunning views from our room, the service and staff were all lovely, and there was so much to do and see within this hotel. Restaurants and the bar on the top deck are a must do if it's a special occasion, the food is delicious and the view is breathtaking. We will definitely be back to stay at Marina Bay Sands again.",5
"Everything is big!! Loved our stay here, fabulous restaurants and shopping - loved every minute...The pool -  divine with the accompanying views! Would highly recommend if you want to enjoy the luxury on your anniversary or honeymoon as the rates aren't cheap but certainly worth every cent! Enjoy!!",5
"Stayed here on a stopover to Bali in July '15 - from the moment we arrived we loved this hotel. Yes, it's big and has the feel of a 'Vegas' hotel but it is very clean, very modern and the staff we encountered very friendly. Breakfast was amazing, a lot of choice including, Indian, Dim Sum and there was even a guy carving a shoulder of ham! And the pool at the top......very nice to be in the pool watching the sun set over Singapore! Would definitely return on next visit to that part of the world.",5
"great view at day and night but it's overpriced. I hope the pool open 24 hours because there were so many people and children. The refrigerator has auto-paid system. so if you pick up any product from refrigerator, it will be charged. For your own refrigerator, they will charge $10 per day.",4
We were upgraded but was not told that the price would be a lot higher (maybe we should have thought to ask as you don't get anything for free).Overall an excellent place to stay. Close to the Gardens which is absolutely amazing.,5
Ppl from information are polite. .pool on top is great. Service is good for breakfast.nice ppl there too.beautiful view from top. The restauran in 57 floor is great. Kudeta bar is great too. Amaizing place to stay in singapore. Lots of shops too. Walking distance to garden by the bay.,5
"My husband and I spent one night at the Marina Bay Sands last week! It was on my bucket list, and as we were travelling to Thailand from Melbourne, we thought we'd have a stop over in Singapore. We have been visiting Singapore for the past 39 years, and have experienced the enormous changes in what was once a beautiful and charming Asian Colonial city! We are sad to see it has mostly been lost in its modernisation, but it is still a great stop over.  Our room at The Marina Bay Sands on the 48th floor with a glorious view across the city was beautiful! The room was enormous and attention to detail first class! But sadly that's where the attention to detail stops! Arriving at 4.30 in the afternoon, I decided to go up to the pool, to have a drink and watch the sun set! What I found…",3
"I arrived at 12.15pm (Saturday, 11 July 2015) and was directed to go to the Club Floor & Suites check in at Tower 1. The young sweet innocent looking lady manning the Club & Suites check in counter at the lobby is a real b%^**! She refused to check me in by giving silly excuses that no rooms available! Told me to come back at 3pm! I told her I've stayed in many hotels & even MBS many times before and I've never faced this issue. I told her ok - can I sit and wait at the Club Lounge till 3pm? She said NO, I cannot. She told me to go walk around the hotel (I have 2 huge luggages with me).  After 25 mins of being super sweet with her & she continued standing her ground, I left.   I then asked another person in security which other places I could check in for Club guests. Security…",5
"You must stay in this hotel during any stay in Singapore.  It is very expensive, and I did it juts for the pool on the top, but it is so worth it.  We actually got upgraded to an orchid suite for free upon check in, which consisted of this ginormous room bigger than our apartment at home.  The room had 2 bathrooms, a huge living area, a huge bedroom, and a balcony that looks like something out of these reality TV shows you can throw a huge party on...yes, it was that big.  The view was even good on the 4th floor and we could see Gardens by the Bay outside and across the street.  As for the pool...absolutely breathtaking.  We easily found our way up there, to the 57th story, and walked the entire length of the pool, which took 5 minutes from one end to the other.  The pool was…",5
My second visit and just as special as the first! Great experience to swim in the pool and lookout at sunset is amazing. I love looking at Singapore lit up at night and the rooms (Premium Deluxe) with twin doubles was perfect for us two mums with daughters. Like being in one of the big hotels in Vegas...self contained city! One special 24 hours!,5
"We were upgraded, even though being on our first stay. The room was spacious, had a great harbour view and the view from the world famous pool is gigantic.  Furthermore, this property will frustrate you,   - Overcrowded with mainly asian tourists - overcrowded, loud pool deck - construction going on on the pool deck - massive (!) queues for checking in and out - massive queues for the breakfast  It's a once-in-a-lifetime stay but prices are way too steep when you are not about the view from the pool. Good alternatives would be the SO Sofitel nearby, offering more value for the money (but not the great view from the pool)",3
The best swimming pool ever on the 57th floor. The staff are unexpectedly good and very helpful. A trip to Singapore is worthless without staying here. You must stay a night here so you can experience the pool and the lavish facilities. The Shoppes is also very good. See the fireworks on Marina Bay at night. Visit the Art and Science Museum too!,5
"Service: average Rooms: good but air conditioning not cold enough  View: excellent (but u ain't gonna stay in the room 24/7 right?) Accessibility: above average Price: look, its a prestigious hotel so don't expect it to be cheap Places to visit (within walking distance of between 5 minutes to 25 minutes): - Singapore Flyer (Ferris wheel) - 10 minute walk - Helix Bridge - 5 minute walk (Please visit at night to capture the beautiful lightings) - Science Museum - 5 minute walk - Marina Bay - 5 minute walk (there is a show. twice a night. check with front office) - Casino - 1 minute sprint (if u feel rich, you'll poorer after that. just kidding.. gd luck) - Marina Bay Sands Shopping - 5 minute walk - Skybridge / Skypool (1 minute, depends on which floor u stay) - Gardens by the Bay…",3
Excellent! Totally Superb. We really enjoyed our stay in Marina Bay Sands. The infinity pool is so amazing.,5
"We stayed here one night for a staycation to make full use of the facilities.  It was nice that we could check-in before the official check-in time. I didn't like it so much that no one explained the hotel features to us. For example I had to call them later just to find out where and when breakfast was. No one told us that we always have to bring all room keys when using the pool. The guy at the pool entrance actually made me go back to my room and bring the second key. Really annoying, especially because we had a small baby with us.  The pool is probably the most famous in the world. And surprisingly it is completely crowded during the day. Not so enjoyable. We came back in the early morning and it was better. Nevertheless, a nice experience.  It was my wife's birthday and I…",4
"The highlight of this hotel is the location and the pool. If you are in Singapore, definitely stay here for a couple of nights. The pool is a unique experience, the bar at night is great and you have the best view in Singapore! You can also see all the Marina Bay attractions, definitely worth the money! The rooms are standard for a four-star hotel, the best part is floor to ceiling windows with the view of the bay and downtown Singapore. I have really enjoyed my stay, this hotel is an experience in itself due to the views you get. Amazing!",5
"I book the Orchard Suite with City View in Mid. June at Agoda.com for my son's Birthday. When I checked on 15th July, I got the Orchid Suite room on 19th Floor on Tower 1 but was shock when I went into the room, it is much smaller than the Orchard Suite I stay earlier, I complained to Front Office Mgt. and Erricca Tan, the Guest Service Executive was kind enough to change us to a bigger Suite, which is the same as my previous visit on 52th Floor on Tower 3. Everything went well and my family was greatly appreciative with the entire arrangement. the staff is hospitable, pleasant and very nice to meet all our requests. This is a hotel that will all out to satisfy its regular guests. We will definitely be back.",5
Stayed here in June on vacation. I would strongly recommend this hotel absolutely amazing place and exquisite service... Was a delight to stay and will recommend to anyone staying to upgrade to a club room 😄🙏  best hotel in Singapore for aure,5
"If you don't mind splurging, MBS is a must stay in Singapore, even for a night. Being a huge hotel, expect a long queue to check-in and check-out. A deposit is required and I suggest the use of credit card so that you can enjoy the express check-out at the end of your trip. The room was alright but the view are stunning especially during sunset and sunrise. While the infinity pool is quite popular, it can get crowded at times. Do remember to bring along your key card per adult to gain access the pool and observatory area.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay at MBS.  My full review here: http://lonelytravelog.com/2015/07/12/review-marina-bay-sands-hotel-singapore/",5
"My wife, daughter and myself travelled to Singapore en-route to the UK. We had 3 days there and during that time we visited the Marina Bay hotel, having been to Singapore a couple of times prior to this trip but never visited this incredible hotel. This time we did ! what an experience that was... the views of Singapore from the roof gardens were quite stunning. From the restaurant at the summit you can see the 'Infinity Pool' that is available to the hotel guests... very different ! We had a couple of glasses of wine and a couple of snacks which were excellent but definitely on the dear side. My take on that was ' we were sitting in paradise with a million dollar view so who cares if you spend a few dollars more than you would normally ? ' If you tell the porters at the base of…",5
"We got a room in tower 3, facing the sea. The room was decent size, clean. it had a balcony, giving a very beautiful view of the Garden by the Bay.  The thing to die for in this hotel is the swimming pool on the top.  Otherwise, the hotel is a bit over-rated.",4
"We stayed in the club rooms at around $700AUD per night after ++. So you need to make sure you get your monies worth.   The good stuff........  Transfer was exceptional in a top of the range Merc ($206AUD) it was a special occasion so we splashed out.   Check-in was very easy with VIP treatment. We were met at the door of our limo, and taken directly to our room, our bags followed quickly. We were made to feel very special, passport and credit cards etc all done in our room.  The rooms are extremely spacious and the city view is magnificent. Definitely world class. (42nd floor)  The roof deck is stunning, even with the renovation happening it was just stunning. A little crowded at times but on the whole very enjoyable.   Breakfast in the club lounge (level 55) was faultless and…",4
"Found everything at the hotel average except for convenience for fine dining, casino and shopping for branded goods. They can improve a lot more on their room deco, toiletries and add on the finer touches. Might get a bit crowded sometimes and it doesn't feel as exclusive as the price suggests.",3
"The location is very nice, with great access to a shopping mall and a metro station. Furthermore, the architecture and the view is incredible. However, I didn't like the pool as there were too many people who are desperate to take a photo, and the lobby was also packed with tourists who tries to speak over each other and it was like a chaos. Also, the service was quite poor, as I called for a room cleaning and it still didn't come two hours later due to the fact that there are over 2500 rooms to serve. Definitely worth staying for once, but in comparison with the hotels I've previously stayed like Ritz-Carlton and the Raffles, it's not quite the hotel you would want to spend your time in Singapore. I hope the hotel prohibits photos on the pool and make a chargeable photography…",3
"We picked out the hotel online based on price and amenities without realising just how unusual the design and layout of this hotel is.  It is futuristic to look at and vast inside.    Although we had booked for two adults and two teenage children we were told on check-in that we should upgrade to ensure enough space - which was disappointing though in fairness the hotel helped us sort something out.  The furnishing of the room was high quality and breakfast buffet was a good standard.  Room service worked well.  With its skyline view the rooftop pool was amazing, though don't go there if you like peace and quiet.  Water quality was not the best.  There is a sense of something new and exciting about this hotel, but for us we prefer a more personal touch.",3
Stayed at the premiere suite for 1 night at the 36th floor. Overall I can say that it met my expectations given the price for the night. The food at the skating rink was pricey for ordinary food. Te room itself was satisfactory. It has a large bed and nice view of the gardens by the bay. Toiletries are adequate. Facilities are good. The pool was not bad. Quite crowded even in the early morning. ,4
you have to go by elevator at the 59th floor and have a great view. But the bar is very expensive. The pool is only available for hotel guests.,4
"We are a family of 4 and have stayed in the hotel for a day and night. We found the staff members very nice and efficient, and the rooms were very spacious. We stayed on the 35th floor of Tower one. Soon after we checked in, we could smell the strong cigarett smell in the corridor and some smell inside the room. I am a person particularly sensitive to cigarett smell and easily get headache because of it. So, I openned the door towards the balcony in the hope the air could get better. Once the door was closed and the air conditionning was on, the cigarett smell started again. I called the express service desk and the person on the line was very apologetic and sent somebody upstairs to refresh the air. The person also believed the cigarett smell must have come from the air…",2
"I didn't stay there however I went there with my family for a drink and a snack to checkout the view and it was well worth the money. As much as it was amazing to look at, I don't think I would like to stay there. It seems a bit too busy and I wouldn't think it would be relaxing. I would recommend going to the C'est la vie bar and having a drink and a snack to appreciate the view! What an amazing place! ",4
"Great location, great room. only downside there was construction in the pool area when we were visiting and it was very very noisy and would ruin the whole holiday mood while you're chilling at the pool you couldn't hear yourself think from all the noise. But other than that, everything else was well worth it. get ready to spend LOTS of money if you're planning to dine inside the hotel. Casino is really nice too.",4
"Stayed for 2 nights at Tower 3, floor 37, the view was incredible from the balcony...facing the gardens by the bay....could even see and hear the evening show from the room. as far as the hotel is concerned, honestly, not too happy...there were huge queues for check in, luggage took 40 minutes to deliver to my room, and this was a problem not just with me, but with a few other people in the same tower... the bathrooms were big, but no bath tubs...the toiletries were typically some chinese brand (didnt look luxurious to me!)..went twice to the pool, but couldnt enter..it was like a fish pond! incredibly full.... the sky park is something nice during sunset hours...can have a drink and nibbles outside if you wish..",3
"I stayed for 1 night in a standard room which was very spacious. Although it was only level 11 the view was gorgeous with festive lights show after dark. The shower cabin was huge - you could dance in it. Sufficient lighting everywhere, you can have all lights or only desk light or nigh lights, etc. Views from the pool area are very impressive. Excellent service. I arrived around 8 am and the room was not ready but receptionist registered me, provided advice on where to leave the luggage, suggested use of swimming pool on level 57. At 9 am I received an email that the room was ready. During check-in for the room itself I requested later checkout due to a conference session that clashed with the normal checkout time. The reception lady (I think her name was Vicky) checked the…",5
"If you have been to Las Vegas you have been to the MBS. It’s big, its loud it’s full of middle class families with a lot of kids.  The hotel has 2600 rooms so you would think two people per room or about 5000 guests. NO…..there are 4,6,8 people per room so you have to fight 10,000 to 12,000 people in the hotel.  The wait for the elevators are nightmarish during the basic rush hours. The lines snake into the lobby.  The pool on 57, while it is a highlight and the views are pretty cool, is packed with hundreds and hundreds of people. It is a F…king nightmare. There is not enough chlorine in the world to kill the germs that have to be in that water.  Service is basically nonexistent. There is nothing personal or exceptional about being a guest here. It is pure numbers. You are one…",3
"We stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon and had a lovely time. The rooms were very spacious and we paid a little extra to make sure we got a bay view of all the skyscrapers which was both amazing at day or at night. I think we were on the 30ish floor.   The hotel is huge, biggest I've ever stayed in. You could just literally walk around it for hours. The roof top pool is a must for anyone staying there, with it's infinity views over the city making for some excellent photos, any time of day.   The casino in this place is also a must do. It apparently has up to 25,000 people going through it most evenings and is based on three floors. It has more gaming tables than you can shake a stick at. The minimum bets were £2.50 on roulette and £12.50 on Black Jack. Despite not…",4
"I had an excellent week at the Marina Bay Sands. The hotel itself is a site to behold: innovative architecture and stylish decor. The Rise restaurant was consistently high in quality and the staff were very friendly and among the most attentive I have come across. Additionally, the chef was so helpful with regards to my allergies, personally walking me through each dish at the buffet.  The hotel's location is great with a MRT subway and it is also attached to a luxury shopping mall.  The gym is state of the art and the view from the Skypark is incredible. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is an experience of course, but due to the many visitors enjoying it, it is rather like an oversized paddling pool in which not much actual  swimming can be done. However, this minor caveat…",5
"Stunning (large) hotel with an amazing pool.  Room was great, view amazing, bed superb, staff good, food great.  By far the best thing here though is the pool, worth the stay just for that.    Hotel is quite busy and checkout was a slight pain, with issues with billing.",5
"Place to rejuvenate you completely. Absolutely class beyond compare, in all aspects. Right place for family entertainment, lovely garden side view, clean ambience, great shopping options, continental variety of food stations, & warm greetings by staffs of all departments. For me it was a total VALUE(worth) PACKAGE. last but not infinity POOL no words, all must experience",5
"I've just finished my trip to Singapore and it was great. Singapore is very friendly, clean, expensive country. One of my best experiences was staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel, the most spectacular hotel in Singapore. From the beginning to the end was all great. It was easy to make reservation from Vietnam without any deposit, I got replies very quick and full of detail needs. When I came it was also very welcomed. During my stay, all my request was satisfied with friendly, helpful staff. The most interesting thing is the Infinity Pool on 57th floor. Swimming there is one of the most interesting things to do in the world. Definitely will come back.",5
"The Marina Bay sands could get really crowded and for good reason.  It is very near a popular attraction in Singapore which is the Gardens by the bay where you could visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome.  The highlight of the hotel however is the Infinity pool on the 57th floor, just make sure to go there early in the morning to avoid the crowd.",5
"After arriving at the hotel after our delayed red eye flight we were greeted by the friendly reception staff. The check in was a breeze (8.00am Thursday) and we were over the moon when we were able to check in early and go straight to the room.  We were in tower three on the 46th floor with breathtaking city views. As we opened the door to the room the curtains opened to and revealed the view which I thought was quite welcoming.  The hotel amenities were impressive with a beauty station/work station set next to the window with a fair anount of natural lighting. The kingsize bed was so comfy, the room and bathroom were spacious (with lovely shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided)   We decided to treat ourselved to buffet breakfast at Sky on 57 (reviewed seperately) then…",5
"After all the hype, my 11 year old son and I were not disappointed. Check in was easy, long walk to our tower but that's due to the sheer size of the place! When we got to our room, the TV wasn't working but it was fixed within minutes. Definitely upgrade to the club room with breakfast. You will not go hungry ever!  Free breakfast, free afternoon tea from 2 to 4pm, free drinks and snacks from 5 to 7pm. Food is amazing and the service is incredible. Would come here again, if we could ever afford it again!",5
"I have chosen this hotel for this wonderful pool. It is really surprise me. I did not regret of it. Highly recommended others choose it for holiday. Except pool, the room is tidy and clean. It is quite a good place to stay.",5
The rooms are lovely and big and  Well furnished-great air con and television service-attached to a huge designer mall with great Restaurants by world name Chefs. Very very busy which made for a long queue to check in and even Then could only get one of the two rooms-the other not freeing up To 4.30.   Every member of staff We're delightful and friendly with One exception being the lady Manager of the night time buffet Who was non smiling and disdainful -certainly thought her position was 'above us' the paying Guest....infinity pool on 57 floor Incredible....A very nice hotel ,5
"It was a grat experiece to be at this hotel because it has one of the best atractions, the infinity pool over 57 floor. I didn't give it all the points when I gade it becase I didn't like that this very big hotel with a lot of people coming in and out, doesn't have a lobby where you can sit in confortable chairs if you have to wait for some reason.",4
"This is the total hotel experience all in one. A wide range of restaurants, great access to shops but the star attraction is the rooftop pool. It just has to be done. Note that if you take a suite you can gain access to the executive club areas.",5
"The pool is amazing.  300 yards + long with one adult section.  Chairs a limited so get there early.  Worth the splurge for the Club level, great breakfast and evening cocktails and appetizers. The room was very spacious with top of the line amenities.",5
"We had a short stay at Marina Bay Sands mainly to enjoy the view and the swimming pool. Hoped it will be great experience, unfortunately it wasn't that great. To be fair, all the staff were very friendly and trying hard to make a good impression. Few main problems where: - overcrowded swimming pool - if that is the main attraction I would think it should be maintained in a way for a guest to be able to enjoy it. It was extremely crowded and noisy, even late in the evening and early in the morning. - there is a construction side just next to the swimming pool on the roof. I do understand that the workers have to do their job but again, I would hope the work is schedule so that the guest can enjoy being on the roof without constant noise coming from just a few meters away. - air…",2
It was raining when we went to the Sky Park at the Marina Bay but it did not dampened our mood to enjoy the view that was in store for us. Up there and looking at the world below inspire my family to travel more. The one pass ticket was quite expensive but if you will miss going there then you haven't gone to Singapore.,4
The room was clean and tidy as you would expect and we had a great view from the 22nd floor from tower 2 looking directly over the 'gardens by the bay'. The Mini bar is pressure sensitive and you will be billed for any moved or used items. I recommend calling guess services and paying a one off fee of S$10 for your own mini fridge to stock up on your own food and drinks as we did. Unfortunately the closest convenience stores are a 7eleven at the Bayfront MRT station entrance from the MBS (very very small store) and a Cold Storage in the MBS shopping complex. All are a bit of a walk from the hotel. There is another 7eleven in the shopping complex at bay level and another one at the furthest MRT exit from the hotel. The room air conditioner is linked to the balcony door and as a…,4
"We booked the hotel for a weekend Getaway with the Family, we were unfortunate to experience the Jakarta Airport Fire as we're about to leave, so our flight was delayed by 12 hours. I was in communication with MBS Front Office via email, they were quick to response and understand our situation.  After a very long frustrating ordeal at the airport we finally leave... MBS held our reservation, and was kind enough to upgrade our room!  that helped my family ease back to relax... we totally enjoyed the short trip, the pool was awesome... my kids loved it!! We'll definitely will go back here!!",5
"The hotel is great for business purpose because it is right besides the convention centre, the place to deal with business matters.  Also you do not have to go beyond the hotel vicinity to do such a leisure activities.  Just a trip up the elevator for a sky pool and stunning view bars, or a walk down the hallway to do some gambling at the best casino in Asia.",5
"Generally the stay was good based on the following factors: 1. Good customer service, from the front desk to the bell boys, everyone has a smile on them. You treat them with respect, they will be open to you and assist beyond their service requirements. 2. Great amenities - Skypark, swimming pool, gym and even the hot pool, its all great. Its just that I came across disgusting China patrons who treated the hot pool as a foam bath, but again nothing much MBS can do against unconsiderate patrons. 3. Food - This is a bit challenging to find reasonable local food at reasonable prices. Just note, you can walk down to Marina Square via Helix Bridge and cut through the park, where you will fund abundance varieties of food, drinks and entertaiment joints! Head there if you seek value…",4
"I have visited Singapore on a few occasions along with my wife. It really is a spectacular place and such an ideal place to stopover for a day or two on the way from Australia/NZ to Europe. There are a great deal of things to do and see, hence we returned on more than one occasion.  We have always admired the Marina Bay Sands from afar - it truly is iconic in the skyline of Singapore. This time, we decided we had to stay there - just a one off treat!  Just entering the lobby was an experience - just so lavish and HUGE. We have stayed at plenty of nice hotels and resorts - but this was architecture on steroids. Simply amazing.  The check in process was seamless and we were upgraded to a huge suite - we were delighted.   The suite was sublime - from decor to layout , to automatic…",5
"Beautiful hotel but too crowded. The best part of the hotel is the Infinity Pool which overlooks Marina Bay. We were there for 3days 2nights in July, the weather was unfortunately hazy. Although we were high up in the pool, we couldn't see as far as we thought we would.  The view from our room was stunning, we faced the Gardens by the Bay. Wifi was a bit slower than we expected. Service was great, checkout was a breeze! However, I don't think we would return to this hotel. Too overcrowded for our taste!",4
this is one of the many attractions that Singapore has to offer. Amazing view over looking all of Singapore from the top of the hotel. While the inside offers variety of stores you can shop at and mutlicultural YUMMY food!,4
"Went following a  visit to the gardens at bay. Was very pretty, and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Singapore.  We did go at night, it was easy to get to via the metro, the Singapore skyline was stunning.  And there are restaurants conveniently right on the bay.   ",4
"So it's my second time in Singapore this year and this place never fails to amaze me!  It's a must visit place, classy, modern, chic, edgy architecture and it provides all sort of services. I have not stated overnight but I have visited the top deck, the swimming pool, the mall, the park and the outside court. Stunning place!",5
A must stay during your visit in Singapore. In the heart of the city with world class infrastructure and excellent value for money the Sky lounge and terrace Pool make a amazing place to stay in. With a multi million brands in the mall attached you won't feel like going anywhere else to shop. The sprawling Bay Garden attached is just fabulous. Singapore is best with a stay at Marina Bay Sands. Stay at the higher level. We just got upgraded by paying few extra dollars and got a beautiful city view room at 50th floor. Lovely pool side snacks is also available.  ,5
"This evening paradise for all kinds of visitors is the most sought after destination.one can enjoy the beautiful sight of sunset,go round the bay and experience the unforgettable moments spent there .there are plenty of places for a good dinner thereafter .as I write this review ,I am happy to record that my son ,daughter in law and lovely 14months old grand son have spent time in marina bay today and have endorsed my experience !what a coincidence",5
"Check in was easy, staff friendly and the hotel was just awesome. The pool was the highlight; breakfast expensive but good. Cocktails upstairs at night were pretty ordinary and exceptionally expensive at $57 for two! We got a late check out which was great. If you book a basic room and upgrade at the front desk it will be cheaper than pre-booking. You won't get the room cheaper on N external booking site either so just book direct if you can afford it. Our superior city view room was about $650 a night from memory.",5
This high rise is quite remarkable. A little daunting to look at but wow what a feat of engineering. Inside is actually great too. It is big though and you can get lost trying to find your way around for the first day. The pool bar on the top is to die for. The alcohol like all places in Singapore is very expensive. Sky on 57 is pretty special but is ultra $$$$$$. Once in a lifetime view though - superb - and for all its business the service was still good.,4
"Stayed here for one night. We only justified spending the amount of money we did for the view. We stayed in a club room on the 38th floor. Fantastic view, especially at night when the skyline of Singapore is all lit up.  We were greeted by the concierge when we arrived and were shown to the check in area, where there was a special line for club rooms so we didn't have to wait too long.  Club facilities were excellent and the service was great. We checked in too late to have the afternoon tea, but the canapés were amazing and drinks were included too. Lots to choose from.  The breakfast was also incredible. We were told there was less to choose from in the club lounge but we thought there was more than enough.  The pool was ok but very busy. I went for a swim at around 7am and…",4
"We spent welcome eve at beach sand when we reached Sinsapore on April 17, 2015. Most attractive tourist for boating, open theatre, food&drinks, shopping and even viewing! The glittering lights of the skyscrapers reflecting on the bay gives a view of a dreamland. Enjoy, enjoy & enjoy!",5
"Expect no welcome greeting from staff - no one will even bother to open your car door or help you with the luggage unless you go looking for the staff.  Checkin will take a long time as you should expect long queues. You should also expect checkin staff to sometimes be discriminating. Some guests get water asked and other don't.  Rooms are good sized however the showers are like motels in New York and it's the hotels commitment to being ""green"" they maintain low pressure showers through tout the hotels. I did not feel fresh after my showers.  Air conditioning in this part of the world should have a chilling effect but their a/c s are designed not to go below 20 degree Celsius which is a put off for me.  Kettle, tea bags were missing when we checked in but were duly replenished…",1
"No doubt about it, Marina Bay Sands Complex is one of the most amazing spots to be and visit during a stay in Singapore! The hotel itself is a mega complex with its three towers and multiple shops options, a trully maginificent architectural landmark that will remail forever in your memories, mainly after a plunge in the iconic swiming pool on the 57th floor. Rooms are big enough, very well appointed with all necesary aminities including the extra touch of a 5 stars hotel. I found a little bit dissapointing the walk in shower in the bathroom, where water presure were not as good as one could expect at this tipe of property. Please, no hesitate to book a room overlooking the singapore bay, that will assure you a more memorable stay! Personnel is very welcoming and attentive, just…",5
"Amazing views, scenery customer service. A great experience overall. Just an immaculate structure and of course amazing food beverages and also swimming pools and shipping. Its just a tranquil paradise",5
"We were there for a business conference my husband was attending.  The hotel is large and lovely, very clean, great staff.  Smiles greet you everywhere.  Our room (16th floor) was ordinary by their standards (no upgrade for us!) but very large-sized, great firm bed, lovely bedding, towels, bathroom.  We had a balcony and overlooked Gardens By The Bay.  Was concerned about the casino, but its location is very discreet and subtle, unlike casino hotels in Las Vegas, US, which tend to make the casino very in-your-face.  Has its own MRT station and also huge beautiful mall.  We enjoyed it and were treated well.  The 57th floor infinity pool is amazing---never seen so many people taking selfies in the pool in my life!!  Not scary at all, if you are concerned with that.  At edge of…",5
"Have stayed at this hotel for one night during our trip to Singapore last December during Christmas holidays. Very big hotel with too many guests. Never felt welcome at the hotel. Had to queue up for almost 20 minutes to be seated to have breakfast. The skydeck is fabulous so is the infinity pool. But thats almost all of it. With such high prices, one expects much better services. Yes the rooms are clean & nicely appointed but that is the basics for any 5 star hotel.",4
"The Marina Bay Sands is all that you'd expect it to be, the rooms, the infinity pool, lobby and restaurants make it a worth while stay and kind of the mecca for a visit to Singapore.  The shopping is of course every fashionista with big wallet's dream.",5
"Hotel is great, service is very good and there's a few restaurants and bars to go to within the hotel. Also a shopping centre and casino on campus which along with the rooftop pool means you really don't have to leave the hotel if you don't want to. The pool is the best bit - it stays open until late (11pm) and is stunning night and day. Worth the trip alone.",5
"What a breath-taking hotel!! We stayed in this hotel in Christmas time, I have to say we been well travel around the world and stayed in some excellent hotels, but noting can compared with Marina Bay Sands Hotel. very close to Singapore main attractions, and shopping malls. The hotel lobby was so big you can easily lost. Hotel concierges was extremely helpful with our bags, Check in was fast as we booked club room. the room giving to us was big; light and view of the Garden By the Bay, what a view! The package we bought was including Cocktail buffet; Afternoon tea and breakfast, I have to say noting disappointed us, Foods was great; services was excellent and the view is breath taking as the restaurant was next to the Infinity Pool. THE POOL- this is the main attraction…",5
"+ Obviously the swimming pool!  + The free upgrade (Girlfriend had her bday),  + The premium room with the city view from the main room and the view over the gardens from the bathroom (great to take a bath the view over the Gardens by the bay) + Staff was really friendly.  + Cherry on top of the cake, we could witness the rehearsal of the Singapore Air Force whilst chilling in the pool. Quite impressive!  + Restaurant/Bar KuDeTa. A bit pricey but good value for price, especially when compared to other restaurants in town, which don't boast the same view.   - Check-in/out time, which doesn't allow you to enjoy the pull to its fullest, especially when you book for one night only.  - The crowd. Pool is overcrowded, with kids jumping every where. There is an adult only section but…",5
"It's the best hotel I've ever visited. I've been to more than 15 countries, but this one is the best. Please, don't grudge your money, visit just for a one night. To feel this - is costs that amount. Early Check-in and late check-out without additional paying. They've gave me a card to get to the swimming-pool, before I could get to my room (9AM).",5
"I love the pool in high floor..amazing places...very high class...delicious food..beutiful view..great location..but high price..stunning room,very clean..hoply I can back to spend my holiday in there",5
