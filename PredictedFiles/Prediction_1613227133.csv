The staff from the door men, to the room porters , check in and waiters were second to none, all helpful and so welcoming . Our hotel room was on 47th floor overlooking the bay and what a stunning view everything about this hotel was top class. The infinity pool was surreal overlooking Singapore and an experience you will never forget, well done Singapore you were a beautiful city to visit ❤️❤️",5,Positive
1,"Ce La Vi Lounge has the best view of Marina Bay Hotel both front and back!!! You can spend the same amount of money to go to the observation deck but no food and bev this is the better deal! It's $22 per person then the money goes toward your food bill. The menu is pricey but you are paying for that spectacular view. BJ was a very sweet and friendly server, he helped us with getting around the City!!! Thank you to BJ at Ce La Vi and I would recommend this place to others! There were many families with children, great for all ages!!! DON'T miss this restaurant during your stay in Singapore!!!",5,Positive
2,Unforgettable experience in the sense of crowded reception but fast and great polite service given by the hotel staffs. We will shocked with wonderful room view and spacious room but swimming pool always crowded,5,Positive
3,"The main USP of the hotel is the infinity pool and staying at the hotel to enjoy same was quiet worth it.  Interaction with hotel staff during booking and while at hotel was quiet nice.  After reading number of reviews it's better to book club class room or higher as you avoid train station like rush at front desk as there is separate check-in for club class and higher room and it was quiet smooth. It also give access to club 55 where u can have evening tea (2-4) and evening drinks(5-7) with marvelous view. Even though check-in time is 1500, they do allow u to use the pool and club 55 before that. Club room was quiet spacious and as expected had a marvelous view. Watched the light and sound show from room itself and my kids enjoyed it.  Best time to visit the pool is in the…",5,Positive
4,"As a flagship hotel of Singapore, located at the golden location, marina bay. This hotel is a must for us.  However, I think the hotel was too crowded, too busy, too business-wise for us. As a family of 4 travelling just for fun, it didn’t feel right. The lobby feels like a train station or airport. Lucky us we booked the club room so we had a fast-track check in. The shopping mall is good offering many restaurants and shops. The infinity pool, observation deck, roof top bar were too busy at all time. We went there early morning (7 am) hoping to see no one in the pool but no, there were hundreds of them already everywhere. The evening canapé at club 55 is one of the best I’ve ever had. They offer bigger-than-normal-canapé portion compared to other hotels with wide selection of…",4,Positive
5,"We stayed 3 nights at the Marina Bay Sands before taking our cruise to Hong Kong. We booked a Sands Suite and we were located on the 40th floor in tower 2 overlooking Gardens by the bay! The suite, the staff, the service were full 5 star! Breakfast at the Club was fantastic and the roof pool is so amazing, what a view!!! This was our top hotel so far and we’ve been to many 5 star hotels across this great planet of ours. ",5,Positive
6,"The best destination spot for a holiday , let it be family visit or any other type of visit . 3 towers ,casino & infinity pool just awesome.  Singapore trip without visiting Marina is waste.   Electrifying atmosphere of infinity pool is lifetime experience. JUST VISIT TO BELEIVE.",4,Positive
7,"We stayed a night at the MBS because the infinity pool was on my bucket list. It sure did not disappoint! Although there were quite a few other people enjoying the facilities as well, the pool did live up to the hype. As for the hotel itself, albeit MBS is not considered the best hotel in Singapore by locals, we thoroughly enjoyed our spacious, comfortable and clean room from which we could see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay. To be honest though, the main reasons to stay here are the pool, the view and the wow-factor, not the rooms. In any case, the staff was very accomodating. Had to manually reconnect to the wifi several times, which was annoying.",5,Positive
8,What an awesome venue. The views are spectacular and the restaurants delicious. The infinity pool is amazing. Venture across the bay to view the hotel and lights show. It’s something to behold. I ordered room service a few times and while it generally took about 30 minutes to arrive it was delicious and the service was impeccable. ,5,Positive
9,If in Singapore highly recommend even just one night here. It is spectacular & well worth the money. We stayed on the city side on a higher level and loved it. The infinity pool is well worth the money for the stay. A must if in Singapore!,5,Positive
10,"PRO: This building has become an icon of the Singapore skyline, and it is an architectural marvel.  All that does not matter match when you are in the hotel.  If you like the bustling casino-like atmosphere, then this hotel may be for you.  The service we experienced was excellent, both at the check in and at the bars/restaurants. CON:  Rooms are small and not particularly luxurious by Singapore standards.  There are so many nicer hotels in Singapore.  The roof deck and swimming pool are a zoo.  There are tons of people all the time and it feels like you are swimming in someone else's bathwater.   My suggestion is to visit the hotel and have dinner or drinks there, but stay at a nicer property like the Four Seasons, the Mandarin Oriental, or the Ritz.  At least if you prefer…",3,Neutral
11,"We booked 2 nights just before leaving Singapore. Paid the price of a luxury hotel ($650/night !) while it is definitely not a luxury hotel. You mainly pay for the pool… Not that we regret it: it was one of those experiences you have to do once in your lifetime ! We were lucky to find a not so crowded pool on a very nice sunny day.   Our room made us feel like we were in Las Vegas: marble, double doors for the bathroom, lots of space and great views.   Staff from Club 55 was very friendly and useful. The armchairs in our room and at Club 55 could be replaced (very old and especially uncomfortable).   Beware: pillows are comfy but bed is very hard.  ",4,Positive
12,A laser show which is a must see at 2100 HRS from the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Arcade (entrance is from near the Marina Casino). It is a 15 minutes long show. Try to reach there by 2045 HRS and grab a seat. You can go early as well and do some window shopping / shopping as there are wonderful brands and showrooms there.,5,Positive
13,This was the perfect start to our holiday. The hotel itself is spectacular and our room had a beautiful view of the bay and the sky park. The hotel has a lot to offer if you're looking for a relaxing break. The rooftop pool is an attraction in its own right and there are great restaurants and a shopping centre attached to the hotel. It's not exactly good value for money but it's great for a luxurious treat.,4,Positive
14,"I have to be honest: this is not a luxury property though price per night might make you think it is. So, I you expect the best service and a good value for your money, go to the Four Seasons or the St Regis. This is a very expensive hotel and it's not exclusive at all. Maybe social media seduced you (yeah, that's how I fell for it) and you wanna try it, which is ok, but take this into consideration before booking and spending your money. That being said, I don't regret at all the night I spent here. It's very easy to get here from the airport: metro takes you to the entrance in no time. Though it's always full of people everywhere, check in and check out went really fast for me. The lady who helped me check in was amazing: she said a room with view was available and though that…",4,Neutral
15,"POSITIVE The views and the location. The root-top pool.   NEGATIVE Too crowded, feels more like a shopping centre or an airport rather than a hotel. They should restrict most of the areas to guests only. If you pay a premium to stay in a luxury hotel, you expect there to be less people.  Too many restrictions, even for guests (can't use pool after check-out) The pool itself is very crowded, not very well looked-after, no clear separation from the kids area. It's a mess.  Beds are rock hard and not very comfortable Rooms are quite dated, not very modern Everything is super-expensive! $$$",3,Neutral
16,"If ever in Singapore, book Marina Bay at least for 1 night...you wont regret it.It might be a bit pricey but is worth every penny. We stayed at Marina bay for my partner birthday and the service was incredible. At the check-in my partner received a gift for his birthday at the Casino(nice touch) and we received a room with Gardens by the Bay View....OMG ,just OMG The view from our room was like a painting ,we were also able to see the lights in the Gardens from our window...incredible. The infinity  pool was not that crowded and we were able to take some nice pics at the sunset. Is definitely a must...when in Singapore.",5,Positive
17,"We decided to finish our trip with a 3 day stopover  in Singapore and do it in style. We were not disappointed. If this place isn’t on your bucket list it should be. Everything was a jaw dropping eye opener. The rooms were phenomenal, the staff the most friendly and helpful ever.  Then there’s the place itself. As per the title of my review OMG! Restaurants, bars, that 57th floor infinity pool.... it goes on forever. We’re definitely coming back here",5,Positive
18,"We stayed here at the Marina Suites on October of 2013, travelling with family and friends came to visit! Stayed for 3 nights 4 days Our Suite is one of only 9 suites on Tower 1 and we have our own elevator! How posh is that?’  It’s armed with double doors, gym, spa, 3 viewing decks, TWG coffee and teas huge dining area and receiving area! We enjoyed so much! I returned with friends in 2016 and 2017!  It’s a Sands Life!!!",5,Positive
19,"We booked the Marina Bay Sands for the last 2 days we were in Singapore and I must say how impressed we were with this hotel, having been to Singapore 8 months earlier and checked out what was there, shops,food court & restaurants we decided to hang the expense and stay there  this time.  Check in was a 3pm but we arrived around 12 and they found us a room on the 25th floor as we had requested a room on the gardens buy the bay side, there are more expensive rooms on higher floor but this room was in our budget this time. All the staff are so professional with dealing with the guests and nothing is a problem, we were staying in tower 3 and what I liked was the security guard at the lift entrance checking room keys (stops non guests accessing the accommodation floors) Our room had…",5,Neutral
20,"It might be a bit overpriced but it is also an experience. If you can afford it (even for a night) you should do it. At least because it gives you access to this massive Infinity Pool at the top which is also an experience to do once (even if it is very crowded even at 8.30AM) Room was great also, but I would have expected a little bit better for the price (like a real balcony). But I have to say that bathroom was gorgeous. Overall I am glad to have tried it once in my life.",5,Neutral
21,This hotel is located at a premium location. Me and my family really enjoyed there. We stayed there for two days and I must say all the services were amazing. Rooms were well kept and breakfast buffet had plethora of food items.Must stay hotel if you are visiting Singapore.,5,Positive
22,"Arrived to the hotel early, at around 9:00, but was lucky to receive the keys anyways. However, we had to pay 100 SingaporeAn dollars for an extra bed, which was a hit overpriced. Got a room at floor 41. The room was nice; big and pretty clean. However, you have to be careful about accidentally using it taking something that costs money. When ordering food, be aware that things like ketchup costs extra money. (2 Singaporean dollars for 1 small cup!!) Learnt that from experience.  ",4,Neutral
23,"Had a wonderful experience staying in this hotel. My kids love the pool, view was awesome! Thank you Ms Michelle Ramos, Ms Jessica Yap and Zhang Lei for making our stay very comfortable and relaxing. Looking forward to our next staycation.. :)",5,Positive
24,"Luxury room and hotel, We choose room with balcony and face to Garden by The Bay. We can see the Night Performance of Garden The Bay from our room, with music and colorful light. You can see also big cruise ship is leaning back at port.  Trying also the infinty pool and take the picture with highrised building background from the pool.  Going to rooftop (special for Hotel Guest only), enjoy Singapore City and enjoy the bar.  10 minutes walking to Garden by The Bay. don't missed laser light and water show in front of Marina Bay Sands Mall at 7pm or 8pm (ask concierge)",5,Positive
25,"Situated in the Marina Bay area, a short walk from the downtown core, it’s a beautiful, quiet oasis unto itself. The views are spectacular and we love the hotel’s design. The pool is beautiful, the Observation deck amazing and the service blow your mind. Staff is very kind and helpful. In my opinion one of the best hotel in Singapore.",5,Positive
26,I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights its expensive but believe me its worth staying whenever visiting singapore try to stay at least one night in this hotel. So neat and clean ly maintain there is swimming pool named infinity pool at 52floor only in the world family.Ther is metrotrain running below this hotel and dher is also casino .Breakfast we get choice to select from 3 hotels .Everything perfect will definately stay here in my next visit,5,Positive
27,"We have just spent 3 nights at Marina Bay Sands. It’s like a city within a city. People people people. Rude people, ignorant people, some courteous people, and a few smiles from staff. The rooms are OK. The bed is hard! Bathrooms are clean and well stocked.  The internet in the room and hotel is woeful!! Constantly drops out. The top deck pool is unique and easy to get a lounge. Just beware the photographer in the pool......they want from S$140 up...... The food in the restaurants is quite good, coffee is excessively expensive and drinks are even worse.  Forget about the Sands Rewards as it is a pain in the arse to register and then they want your passport to pick up the card!!!",3,Neutral
28,"Spent 3 nights here in March 2019 on route to Perth. Being an F1 fan and seeing this place during the race coverage, it was added to my bucket list of places to visit and to have a plunge in the infinity pool. I was not disappointed and hope to return for the Singapore Gran Prix sometime soon 😊",5,Positive
29,"Stayed here with family in June, and had a nice stay. The hotel is large, consisting of three towers with over 40 floors in each, so the number of guests is very high. Most of the facilities have been designed for these numbers, so things worked mostly OK. This is a nice luxury hotel, but most of the (very high) price of stay is for the infinity polls on the roof of the hotel, and the views to Singapore and views/access to the Marina Bay gardens. For those things one could pay that money (once), but for other (or longer) stays there are better luxury options in Singapore, and for (far?) less money. Rooms higher up are more expensive, and rooms lower are less expensive. Rooms are nice and modern, with the kind of decoration and facilities you would expect from a 5-star hotel (see…",3,Neutral
30,Beautiful Hotel with excellent services.Stayed for 4 nights enjoyed every bit. Highlight was swimming pool at roof top called infinity pool very clean water with amazing view. Expensive but worth staying at least one night,5,Positive
31,"Our Group of 7 paid a visit to the bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands. The view is undoubtedly spectacular! Although each ticket holder was given $20 to spend at the bar, after purchasing 3 cocktails, 1 whiskey and 3 bowls of fries. We were still out of pocket $70! You can view the pool from the bar and be tantalised by the fact you can’t enter. We did not pay extra for the viewing platform and am not unhappy we didn’t! I’m not sure the view is that much better?! Definitely worth a visit!! Grab a drink and soak up the scenery, you’ll feel like you’re on top of the world!",5,Positive
32,"For the best that singapore hotel can offer, it does live up to its standard. Its got great view and big space, view is amazing however, they restrict your entry for infinity pool for not more than what amount of access cards you hold. With it being this expensive to live here and limitation to accessibility. i think its not very worth unless your budget is high.",4,Neutral
33,"I stayed at the hotel recently. The rooms were nice a big however our bags were delivered to the room late, someone came in the room to check if the mini bar was stocked instead of doing this prior to our arrival and there were a few finishing issues particularly with the hotel guest internet service not working and the air con controls in the room not responding...not to mention the check in being inefficient. It's a good hotel don't get me wrong but it is a long way off for being classed as an elite hotel of the world, especially for the money you pay...worth it for the swimming pool....but not as good as say the mirage in  vegas....as a second quick note, the restaurant CE la vie is not worth it. Very over priced, food and service isn't great. We were given the table next to…",3,Neutral
34,"I guess everything has been said in the earlier reviews already. The hotel is located a bit outside the actual ""hotspot"" in Singapore (but all the shopping destinations etc. are still within walking distance), but the hotel itself is full of all kinds of experiences, the world-famous infinity pool being the highlight for us. The rooms were flawless in all regards.  The staff really goes the extra mile to make sure that you as a customer are happy. We even got a complimentary upgrade to a bigger room and a nice chocolate cake served in our room since we had an anniversary.  This isn't the most budget-friendly accomodation in Singapore, but as a once-in-a-lifetime experience it was really great. We were staying for just one night when travelling from Batam (Indonesia) to Johor…",4,Positive
35,"In previous visits to Singapore I’ve always considered staying at the Marina Bay Sands, now that I finally pulled the trigger on it I’m so glad that I did. Everything about it is luxury, and it’s proximity to the Gardens by the Bay is just the cherry on top.",5,Positive
36,It was my 4th time staying at MBS and I always enjoyed it. I always request high floor 11th floor up facing the gardens. This time my family got room 3116. When you are going to the infinity pool make sure to catch sunrise and sunset (wait for the buildings to open their lights up). The pool gets crowded at peak hours like 5-8pm so i advise to go early. Free towels are provided and you can bring it back to your rooms.  There’s a free observation deck visit on your stay so make sure to use them. There’s a pamphlet that they will give during the check in explore everything on it for free. There are lots of restaurants to choose from within the hotel and nearby.  There’s an Express check out and it saves your time! A deposit fee of S$200 is required upon check in on top if your…,4,Positive

38,"The hotel itself is a destination! The breath taking view of the Singapore skyline from the infinity pool is unparalleled. The staff were so courteous and helpful. After a tiring day going around SG, it’s very comforting to know that you will be going to a great hotel which is kept spotless by our daily room attendant Lei Chin. And what’s more, I didn’t even mentioned to them that it was my wife’s birthday as the room was under my name. They knew it possibly thru the passport they scanned when we checked-in and on her birthday, there was a complementary cake for her. The entire stay was unforgettable and staying in MBS is something I’m looking forward to again when I visit SG. ",5,Positive
39,"If you’re looking for a luxurious, top-notch and memorable vacation is Singapore Marina Bay Sands would not disappoint your needs. Aside from the spacious room and great facilities they have very courteous, accomodating and sensitive staff to assist your needs, special thanks to Ms. Joanne Gonzaga for making sure our stay is beyond perfect and comfortable.",5,Positive
40,"BEAUTIFUL hotel with amazing staff! We were able to upgrade the room and had a killer view of the city and the bay! The room was so big and so clean. Truly impressed by every aspect of the hotel. It’s close to everything, there’s an MRT station right below you, and a food court if you don’t want to pay top notch prices. My one complaint though is the buffets. There are 3 which is awesome but I wish there were more selections. The international buffet was not what I was expecting, I was let down. I was expecting more selections like breakfast sandwiches (maybe I’m just homesick and looking for American breakfast foods). Other than my pickiness and homesickness, this is a beautiful hotel with beautiful people! I would return!  Breakdown:  1. Location: less than an hour taxi drive,…",5,Positive
41,"This is a huge iconic property in Singapore.  Located just adjacent to Gardens by the Bay, it is an enormous complex of hotel towers and ultra high end shopping.  Absolutely worth a visit while in Singapore!",4,Positive
42,This hotel is outstanding our flight got in late and they made the check in process seamless and we were thrilled to get room service and hit the bed quickly. We got a room with a view and it didn’t disappoint well worth spending the extra money. The hotel is huge with a casino and a luxury shopping mall attached which is very convenient.   Now let’s talk about the pool it’s a experience that’s for sure. Chairs were readily available even on the weekend and service was great overall. Lavo and spago are great spots for drinks and a quick bite.   Nightlife is also great a short walk to Marquee the best club in Singapore and Jordan Spitz is the man over there.  ,5,Positive
43,We only stayed for 2 nights but it was definitely worth it! Our room was on the 32th floor and faced to the Garden. The view was impressive! The infinity pool was a great experience itself (even though there were SO many people taking pictures).,5,Positive
44,"For me, MBS is the pinnacle of any stay in Singapore. They do everything magnificently. Notwithstanding, here are some of my tips:  * TRY STAY ON A HIGHER FLOOR *  I think it's obvious why, but it really does make a difference. We upgraded from a level 2-9 floor to the 43rd floor and boy were we impressed.  * CITY VIEW MORE SPECTACULAR (imo) * My husband and I had a sea view, while my family had a city view. Imo, the city view was far more spectacular. There are just so many things to look at + you get to see the light show in the evening.  * ORDER ROOM SERVICE FOR BREAKFAST *  Because why not!? What is better than having your breakfast rolled in for you at an allotted time. Would recommend sharing a continental or full english if you're not a big eater. Plenty of food to share…",5,Positive
45,"i stayed for 4 nights during my business trip, and they gave me the room at the 50 floor. Rooms are very spacious even if (in my opinion) not aligned with a real 5 stars hotel. I had in-room breakfast that is quite delicious with a very on time service. It's useful to say that you pay only for the rooftop pool: this is only the reason why you should book only 1 night here in your lifetime.  I've tried all the restaurants and i can say that they are all fine, but nothing extreme excellent. Nightclub super cool for your crazy nights!",5,Positive
46,"Why go there?  The place to add to your ""check-list"" as you visit singapore. We treated it Just like a other tourist attraction as such.  Pros Lovely views on singapore and stunning swimming pool. The breakfast in Chinese restaurant surprising and delicious  Cons ! It is So sooo BIG that I Just felt like another number to check in or another wallet to empty... You will certainly not receive personal treatment like in other 5 stars hotels... Its Just to BIG, too crowded...   They do not accept maestro card... I had to go to an atm like 10 min walk from the hotel and withdraw a large amount of money... I was really annoyed...

47,"before you die do this!  Our son stayed here a couple of years ago and we added it to our list.  We decided to go slightly mad and booked a club room.  This meant we spent nothing in the whole time we were there.  Afternoon tea, club room drinks and savories in the evening and incredible breakfast.  We booked direct and had a beautiful room on the 45th floor.  Highly recommend a city view room - we always sat Garden side when we went up to the club lounge.  Staff were exceptional and very kind to us.  Lived up to our expectations and beyond.",5,Positive
48,"This hotel is absolutely amazing!  But let me tell you, it's severely overpriced and overcrowded.  It's one of the crown jewels of Singapore.  Amazing architecture, amazing views and super beautiful.  The pool is by far the best part of this hotel!  Amazing views looking over this gigantic city of tall buildings.  On the 57th floor, the pool is amazing and super iconic.  With that being said, it's swarming with people and kids!  We are on our honeymoon throughout SE Asia and went from Thailand to Singapore, which was quite a shock and very different!  The Marina Bay Sands is linked to a super huge mall with tons of super high end stores like Gucci, LV, etc.  It's truly in the hustle-bustle part of town.

49,Cocktail and appitizers with my friends at Spago. Wheter you go for the food the drinks the amazing view the hospitality or the music.... it is all there!! The best place to experience Singapore in all ways. Go just before sunset and see the city turning into a fairy of lights - overlooking the greatest infinity pool ever. If you happen to meet Glynn Tay- the manager you are even more lucky- she has the best advices on the right food to try or drinks to experience.,5,Positive
50,I stayed here with my parents and stayed in the sands suite. It wasn't cheap but you do get what you pay for! Had a direct view of the gardens like it was my backyard. My parents loved it as well. The infinity pool was very crowded but expected. Definitely received staying here at least once in your life!,5,Positive
51,"We are hard to please and this hotel did the job. Very nice rooms, good service, attentive staff and good facilities make this a good choice for Singapore stays.   The Club55 service team were amongst the best we have met and greeted us by name every time we entered. The food in the club was good quality and varied each day.  Breakfast, light lunch and evening canapés were provided with drinks after 5pm.   The lobby of the hotel is like Bedlam - very, very, very crowded with streams of tourists yelling and taking selfies so the check-in was not very relaxing and it took a while to find the correct location. However, once through this chore and in the room the madding crowds faded and we enjoyed almost every aspect of our stay. ",5,Positive

My daughter enjoyed swimming at the huge infinity pool overlooking Singapore skyline, we hung out at the windy built in Skypark at the rooftop and had our daily exercise by walking along the nearby Gardens by the Bay,we even got the chance to shop at the MBS mall. During breakfast,we had our sumptuous buffet meal at Rise restaurant at the hotel lobby.  Actually, there's still much to do at the area, being the main tourist spot of Singapore. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends and family !",4,Positive

Our baggages were even stored in the hotel 2 days prior because I informed that we will go to Malaysia first and they made all the arrangements. It was sent to our room at no instant. We got upgraded to a very nice view of Gardens by the Bay. The room itself was spectacular! Smells really good and is very clean and comfortable, you could even just stay in your room!

The hotel has a viewing deck for those not staying in it, many restaurants from world famous chefs, a mega mall  with high end stores, you will definitely have enough to do for a couple of days. We went there for the pool mainly which is opened to guests only. Of course the pool itself is magnificent, but I ended up going twice for less than an hour altogether. It is just that crowded. I get it, most had the same idea I did, but even though I expected for it to be crowded it was a bit more than even I imagined. I would go back however as it is so well located to everything that you want to do. The buffet is good and…",4,Neutral

Room service was quick and our room attendant made us delightful towel animals each day.  This is a HUGE hotel and I can see how people might feel like the personal service is missing. But we did not have any issues. Check in and check out were easy. The concierge was very helpful in booking transportation to Sentosa for us. The restaurants are expensive, yes, but there are other places to eat in the city if it's too much for you. The location is ideal and the architecture is awe-inspiring. Thank you for a lovely stay,",5,Positive

It was a one-of-a-kind experience having a gorgeous view of the gardens and ocean from your balcony, and then soaking in an infinity pool at night, high above a beautiful city. You definitely pay a premium for the uniqueness of this hotel, but it was a fun stay and we have no regrets.   Like other reviewers have already said, it's more like a Vegas resort in terms of the busyness, the mall and casino, the many restaurants, and the proximity to touristy things to do. But if you're only staying one or two nights, all that is a good thing because you don't have to go anywhere else.

We waited for 5 minutes in the check in line before being taken to a counter (which was fast since it takes at least 10 minutes for each person to check in). The women checking us in was able to get us checked in right then at 11. She also provided us with some water and made our dinner reservations for that night (in the hotel). The room was clean and spacious. We did have an issue with our TV not going off.

64,"This is my second stay at Marina Bay. There are many things to like about this place. If you are here for a couple of nights there is no reason to leave the premises. There are many many restaurants and bars, all with different themes throughout the resort. The rooms are very spacious with great views, the staff are without exception just great. The prices can be mind boggling but you are given the menu and you make your choice. Cheaper dining can be found in Chinatown. I stopped here for 2 nights to break a trip from the UK. I imagined relaxing by the amazing pool with its infinity views. The reality was:a lot different. The pool area was unbelievably and uncomfortably overcrowded. Even the pool was crowded. Just too many people in there at one time. But what can you do if you…",4,Positive
65,"Staff are lovely and very friendly, architecture and views are amazing - definitely pick the City View rooms. Restaurants are miles from the hotel though so it’s not too convenient. Also they told me all guests for 15% off and other F&B discounts however none of these were applied to my stay because I choose to pay cash. The restaurants all refused to honor the discounts which is pretty poor customer service if you ask me, especially as I mainly ate in their outlets during my stay. Also note that the staff in the restaurants and tourist spots won’t tell you about the deals - you have to specifically ask otherwise you just pay full price.",3,Neutral
66,"My wife and I have stayed at this property on many occasions and unfortunately we find the hotel just too big and very crowed for us. Its an interesting property as its connected to a wonderful shopping, Casino and Entertainment complex. The property due to its design and swimming pool has become an ""Iconic Property"" and in turn one of those bucket list stays. The swimming pool has one of the best views in the world but unfortunately it gets very crowed and in turn it looses the ambiance, hence why we have never wanted to swim in the pool. Given the cheer size of the complex no doubt comes operational issues, but all in all, its an impressive complex and offers a lot of facilities in the one spot.

Our room was beautiful, and the finishes made me feel like I was relaxing at my (dream) home. The pool is busy, but there are lots of places in the rooftop garden to bunker down to sunbathe or read. The gym is sparkling clean and organised with plenty of space to workout. The adjoining bathrooms are opulent. The staff told us that 6am-9am is peak time with corporate guests, so we worked out around that. What I really loved was access to some of the great attractions. The shopping centre “The Shoppes” can be accessed via underground walkways, and the Gardens By The Bay through an elevated walkway. …",5,Positive
68,"When we first checked in, we felt like in the zoo, there were too many tourists and too busy and way too many rooms, we couldn't use the hotel facilities especially the pool as it was opened to non hotel guests and we felt not exclusive and private, over crowded everywhere, we couldnt stand it. Restaurants were full and not enough staffs to take care the amount of people there.  So we will not go back!  But our room is nice and good view. That's the only good thing about this hotel for our 3 day experience there. ",3,Neutral
69,Singapore is well maintained with greenery everywhere whilst it is also important to keep up with the tourism and yet it's done.

The rooms are very spacious and the bathroom itself was bigger than the  rooms in other hotels we have stayed in in the city!  The staff in the Club 55 lounge were excellent-highly attentive with the free flowing drinks in the evening and very friendly at other times. Food was good at breakfast, could take or leave the afternoon tea and canapés which were both buffet style and not full of amazing choices.  As a resident we were able to use the pool on the roof which is something I will remember for a long time- great experience which made the stay worthwhile.   Would highly reccomend. ",5,Positive

If you wait for about 5 minutes you will manage to get a couple of sunbeds together even if at first sight it looks impossible.

Yes it is very busy, but it really is an experience not to be missed.

The location is also excellent for exploring Singapore on foot.",5,Positive

I was in the third block on the 17th floor (not one for lifts, but you have to do it if you want to go anywhere).  Walking from reception to Tower 3 thought it was very busy, its almost like a street, also think its attached to the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall.  Arriving at the room, put keycard in and the curtains opened automatically, and had a  lovely view of the river where the Lion is, which I loved as having visited that side of the river on my previous visits.

It’s proximity to the gardens is a huge plus but in general, it’s so central to everything you want to see/do in Singapore. I would literally run 3 miles in the morning around the gardens and the whole bay (beautiful when the sun is rising!).  The pool is a modern wonder of the world and staying at the Marina Bay just to enjoy that is entirely acceptable. Get ready to be in a selfie stick heaven when out there though! There’s not much you can’t do at this hotel if your heart desires (Michelin star restaurants, Casino, theater, etc). We definitely will stay here any time we go to Singapore.",5,Positive
79,"The most oft-repeated phrase during our Singapore holiday was 'Bucket List'. Marina Bay Sands is expensive, no two ways about it. Not everyone in our group was convinced about spending even a night here, it took some considerable cajoling from me and one other friend who sided with me over this 'Bucket List' hotel. In the end, we had the entire party converted to our point of view, MBS costed King's Ransom but offered some palatial comforts too.  This isn't a hotel to relax, so even if you have the budget to stay here for a week, my advice would be not to stay for more than 2 days. The lobby is busy like an Airport terminal, teeming with people and luggage being wheeled around as guests try to figure out where to check-in and out. Add to that cafes, shops and restaurants at…",5,Positive

As the first stay was during the last days of the Chinese New Year, the experience differs a bit, but not totally.  As many other reviews already said, the first impression is overwhelming. The whole architecture, the lobby, the crowd of people and everything is very, very impressive – especially after a 12h flight. So do not expect a smooth, calm lobby with individual support. As long as you not a VIP guest the entrance could be crowed. Nevertheless, the service itself, is marvellous.

Once we got off, we were told to walk to tower 1 to check in because tower 3 check in is closed at 7. It was 7:05pm!   The staff at tower 1 check in was very friendly. I felt better after that. The room was nice, and the bathroom was spacious. We had a nice view of garden by the bay. We can actually watch the light show from our balcony. Nice view!  I’m not sure if we supposed to have turn down service but we never did. Another thing I’m not sure is if we supposed to get bottles of water in our room everyday.

The first surprise came when we checked in. Beforehand, we told management that we were newlyweds and that we wanted to spend a special night of our honeymoon here. And Marina Bay Sands graciously accommodated us by upgrading our booking to a suite near the top floor with a wonderful view of the Gardens by the Bay. It was a rather substantial upgrade too since we originally booked the cheapest room which was at the lower floors overlooking traffic LOL.

We were overwhelmed with the MBS generosity and just how fantastic the suite was- who has a grand piano in their room? Wow! The excitement we all felt walking into the suite will forever be a treasured memory. Then the curtain fell down, and they swiftly upgraded us again to another suite, even though it was almost impossible to imagine a better room, it was. Room service: food was well presented and delivered on hot plates. They set the table with cloth serviettes, personalized condiments and a glass of chilled water.",5,Positive

The room interiors were commendable....but really love the bathroom and bathtub cuz spacious.

Imagine how you would feel if you spent almost £400 per night here and the service was awful. The hotel was extremely busy and generally too big. The views were amazing and that's the reason for the 2 star and not 1 star. After 5 minutes the novelty of the scenery wares off and you realise it's a big waste of money and there are plenty of other hotels which will be half the price and 10 times better.  ,2,Neutral

From the lines to check in, to the casino downstairs (with a drink station robot!), to the rooftop pool and sunrise yoga (extremely beginner and boring unfortunately), to the multiple options for restaurants (some extremely good; others extremely rude and not worth the time or money), to the gym and its amazing view, to the rooms.... we stayed on the 45th floor. The view was amazing. The room and bed was great. The bathroom was large and spacious but the designers forgot one important thing - a power point in the bathroom for the hairdryer.

The service is amazing, the architecture is stunning and running of the hotel is smooth and really impressive.

Easy to get lost in the hotel as there are the three towers and all sorts of different lifts you can end up in completely the wrong place!

Each morning the room service attended put another one on the bed. We didn't have the heart to break them up as they looked pretty awesome and good on the end of the bed.  The view is spectacular. In the evening we opened up the curtains and watched the water and laser show. It was amazing to be able to sit in the room enjoying a wine or two watching the show, just chatting away and relaxing.

Access to Club 55 is not as exclusive as we thought, so there are long waiting periods at peak hours, however you get free drinks and snacks!!!

It was beautiful at night and during the day! I think the harbor view would have been interesting during the day, but perhaps less so at night. We took advantage of the large shopping center that is part of the complex on a daily basis. The infinity pool on the top floor of the hotel is a major draw. Some days it was quite crowded, other days almost empty. I have no idea why, except to guess that the hotel had large conferences some days and not others.

Amazing hotel, wonderful suite, incredible views, the pool is unbelievable and Club55 options are brilliant. Made our honeymoon extra special staying here! ",5,Positive
128,I had read a few unfavourable reviews that almost made me change my mind about staying here. So happy we went ahead and stayed 9 nights! Amazing service right from check in through to check out! We travelled with our one year old baby and they provided everything we needed in the room (including things we didn't ask for but were so helpful). Yes it's busy in the foyer and public areas but not to the point where we needed to wait for lifts or to speak to a staff member. There are countless restaurants to choose from and even the high end options accommodate children. The room was spacious even with a cot and the view out to Gardens by the Bay was lovely. The infinity pool does make your stay worthwhile. The views are spectacular. We found that it's not busy before lunch so we…,5,Positive
129,"We stayed here last year on our way over to Europe and this place blew me away. We received an upgrade to a room with a view of the harbour and the city which was very much appreciated. The room itself was beautifully fitted out, reminded me of the Encore Las Vegas in many ways.  The highlight for us though was the rooftop bar, the view from the top is incredible and the cocktail list was superb, I think we had one of everything on the menu by the end of the night. Glynn the bar manager went above and beyond, couldn't have done any more to make us feel welcome. The food offering was also 11/10, the pork belly may have been the greatest bite I've experienced in my life.  If you have the opportunity to stay, do not hesitate. Pull the trigger and book!",5,Positive
130,"I stayed here for 2 nights after everyone telling me this was the place to stay in Singapore. On entrance it felt like an airport, large and extremely busy. We had to queue to check in but were rewarded by an upgraded high floor room overlooking the gardens. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. We went to the pool but that was not a pleasant experience very busy with children and guests taking selfies! We had a very tasty meal at the Italian restaurant on the roof with delicious cocktails but that came at a price! You pay for the view. The most disappointing part of the stay was at check out when we asked could we spend the day by the pool as we had a late flight we were refused! When you give back your key you lose your pool pass!! The beauty is the…",4,Positive
131,"Staying at MBS was something that I always dreamed of. I can surely say that my expectations were totally met and even exceeded!! The whole experience has been amazing and all aspects of it (staff, service, food, overall experience) were incredible.   To start with, coming here expecting this will be a boutique hotel experience with very few people in the facilities and the pool is total nonsense...yes there will be people all the time at the pool, in the observation deck, in the hotel, in the elevator but that is what MBS is so being disappointed by that does not make any sense.  We booked for 2 nights in a club room with skyline (city) view which is absolutely the sweet spot for value and price you can find! If you have the means to do it, it should be a no brainer! we checked…",5,Neutral
132,"Dont get me wrong, this hotel is a beautiful piece of art from the outside. Its an absolutely stunning piece of architecture, that dwarfs much of the Singapore skyline. On the inside, its clean and magnificent too - however I did find it lacking character in the rooms.  Everything was very 'safe' and very 'beige', nothing that stood out. The room was comfortable and clean, and the bed softer than a million feathers, but it really was just too safe. I would've liked a slightly more dazzling room for the price! One thing that I didn't expect was the pool up top to be as clean as it was. I had heard horror stories about this pool, but actually I was pleasantly surprised with its cleanliness all things considered. Overal, the MBS is a 'safe' bet if your looking for something…",4,Positive
133,I first saw this hotel several years ago when watching the F1 GP in Singapore and since then I have been dieing to stay there.  Had the chance this year for a night before a cruise.  Everything I hoped for was satisified from the excellent check in service to the infinity pool on the roof.  You have to see the pool to believe me as words cannot describe the view from the pool.  We stayed in a club room and recomend spending the extra for this.  You get to stay on a high floor with express lifts.  You get a priority check in (although we forgot this).  You have access to a club room on the top floor with snacks and drinks and breakfast is also included in the restaurant on the 55th floor again with amazing views.  Rooms have everything you need and are quite large.  We stayed on…,5,Positive
134,Everything had been great until we checked our bank statements and realised we had been charged twice.   On arrival my partner used his credit card to pay to be told it had been declined. We had been travelling and we were hot and bothered so didn't think to check it had been declined on the reader or ask for a receipt.   I then paid on my card.  Checked our statements to notice both cards had been charged.   I emailed them and to be fair to them they did reply within 24 hours and said they would credit my account.   What I found disgusting was that I spoke with 3 different people and not once did I receive an apology for their mistake. Now I have to wait a minimum of 15 days for £364 to be returned to me.   I think the least I deserve is an apology. Terrible service. Anybody…,2,Negative
135,This was my second time here and I can not be grateful enough to the staff for the lovely suite given to us. I travelled here with my mom and brother and its was their first time and the MBS staff made sure ti make it a memorable one !!! Loved the pool and the room views !!! The rooms were big and super clean...the staff is kind and prompt !!! This is a must stay at hotel !!! it is an amazing experience !!! cant wait to visit again !!!,5,Positive
136,Clean and modern room on the 36 floor . Breakfast has not been included but there many eateries around . I liked city view from the pool . But what I really didn’t like it was a pool water . So many people I understand but too many discharge in the pool water . For me it’s disgusting. I think it’s because guests are not taking a shower before entering. ,4,Neutral
137,"Unquestionably a bit of both. The MBS is known the world over and has become something of a box ticking destination. Well now I have ticked that box and satisfied my curiosity I highly doubt I will return. The rooms were OK, and of course the views are spectacular. But is it really one of the world's best hotels (as a recent BBC documentary claimed) - not in my book. Despite an advance reservation asking for 2 rooms close by, we were allocated one on 33 and another on 36. No big deal right ? Well it is when the lifts serve either 0-34 or 34-57. Luckily our kids are old enough for it not to be such an issue, but nonetheless a little daft from the front desk. The pool area is of course another box ticker - but again it's not faultless. Whilst the introduction of resident only use…",4,Neutral

The infinity pool was spectacular! It is open long hours and is always very busy, but the pool makes the whole visit worthwhile. Breakfast was definitely worthwhile - massive range of food and they would even cook certain meals on request, plus baristas would make coffee to order. Rooms were beautiful - great beds and the bath was very romantic. We also had spectacular views of the gardens across the road and the light shows at night...  The hotel is right next to the train station and a shopping centre.  We are already planning and saving for our next visit...",5,Positive

Very nice it was possible to make use of the shower facilities in the evening after check out   · Lobby and entree is a very busy and not only restricted to hotel guests, but there are loads of non guest tourists, conference / business men, casino visitors etc. It gives the feeling this is a multipurpose building which accidentally also has hotel rooms to offer.

140,The hotel is incredible. The infinity pool has unreal views. It is open from early morning until night time so you can see the view at different times in the day. We also had a nice view of Garden By The Bay from our hotel room despite being on a low ground floor room. The hotel room was very spacious and clean. Staff were all very helpful and polite. It was helpful being able to get discounts due to staying at the hotel.,5,Positive
141,"The staff was friendly/attentive from the minute we checked in until we checked out. The rooms are very spacious and clean. We had a view of the Gardens by The Bay, which was absolutely stunning. We (like most hotel guests) enjoyed the afternoon/next morning at the pool, which can get pretty crowded. The drinks were a little expensive, but to be expected from such a staple hotel in Singapore. The views of the city are amazing and the staff are very friendly, making sure you have what you need.

So thoughtfull and engaging and passionate to make the guests stay wonderful and memorable.. Will definitely be back soon, for the heart warming service this time!!

I wasn’t feeling too well upon my first day so ordered room service probably the best I had ever had.  The rooftop infinity pool is great, good bar and restaurant also with plenty of options to suit all. Staff and service were great and efficient I will be back!!",5,Positive
145,"So it’s definitely not a five star hotel, but worth staying there for the famous rooftop - though I will say the rooftop is a little underwhelming. It’s incredibly overcrowded all hours of the day.   Presumably in an effort to only allow hotel guests on the roof you have to use your hotel key to enter and exit the rooftop, which is fine - but they also have manned key in/key out turnstiles like every 50 feet as you walk the length of the roof - it’s a little much.   The breakfast and afternoon tea are lovely and overall we had good service. ",3,Neutral

Its easily the worst service I have ever gotten in a luxury hotel. There are so many guests no one cares if you have a complaint, you are just a number. I had many firsts in this hotel: consistently waiting for 20min to receive a drink because of the number of guests, I was not allowed to leave the bar until they checked my room number and name (implying that I am lying) and as a final screw you, u are not allowed to use any amenities after your check out.

It is 5 star luxury so don't expect any bargains, discounts etc. You have to pay premium from the coffee to cocktails. Really nice club upstairs, easy entrance to mall and gardens. Our room was so spacious, clean and comfortable. I later stayed at the Westin after coming back from Bintan Island. If you want opulence and premium prices, book here otherwise try the Westin for reasonable priced 4-5star. Would we come back, definitely!!!",5,Positive

151,"I wanted to stay at this hotel and finally got my way in March 2019.     I have done it now, been there and done it.   I would not want to rush back.   The hotel is unique and interesting but it was so busy.  I could not walk through reception in a straight line without walking into the masses, every morning breakfast was like queuing in a staff canteen, the lifts were slow and packed with people and the pool area overflowing with people.   Like I say, should I return to Singapore I would not return to this hotel.   There was only one lady at check-in/concierge who was very helpful and acknowledged us - possibly called Anna - she was a supervisor - otherwise the hotel is too big to offer a personal service.",3,Neutral
152,"I will be honest to start with. Most likely a one off experience for me. Was too big and felt a lot like a Vegas or Macau casino resort. Lots of people (staff included), casino, high end shops, indoor waterfall and canal (fancy a boat ride?), not hard to lose your way. But heck its worth the experience. You pay the high price for the amazing infinity pool and view (forget doing laps - way too crowded!). Beware: don't forget your room pass or you may get hassled by security as I was. Other pluses... the food court is large and has quite a bit to choose from. And garden at the Bay is next door. Our garden view room had a view of the garden and man made structures.

It had its own lounge room/sitting area. Separate dressing room. A spacious, luxurious bathroom supplied with upmarket amenities. The views were breathtaking as we were on the 53rd floor in Tower 3.

The experience and memories made though are priceless.  Check-in was smooth though the employee (Sunny) who helped ended up trying to pull a fast one by telling us that our room was not ready.  She went ahead and changed us to another one that was and that had a better view -- failing to mention the hefty up charge which we noticed on our bill during checkout the following morning.

Staff wete very friendly and I would particularly like to thank Ramesh the front desk manager for going out of his way to really our stay a memorable one. Its staff like Ramesh that makes this hotel different to others. I would also like to acknowledge Fairul in the Rise restaurant for going out of his way to make our dinner a very pleasant one.  He appeared to be a natural hospitality staff who is passionate at what he was doing. ,5,Positive
157,"Never has a Hotel become a symbol of a city itself. Marina Bay Sands is a major tourist attraction in Singapore and it does not disappoint. This is one of the most expensive buildings in the world let alone be an expensive hotel. This building has a Casino, A Mall, and an observation deck. I had the opportunity to stay at Marina Bay Sands and it was worth the money spent.   This is home to the iconic infinity pool that has a great view of Singapore Skyline and some even stay at this hotel just to use the infinity pool and take some cool snaps. The service and the check in was a bit delayed but we can understand as this hotel is so huge and has thousands of visitors every day. Staying at this hotel is a once in a lifetime experience which will never forget.",5,Positive

Nice shopping around the hotel compound (The Shoppes Mall). Convenient to travel with the underground Bayfront MRT train just below the Hotel Casino. Able to view the 15-min Spectra Laser Light & Water Fountain jets show from the privacy of our room on the 32nd floor (though we liked to watch it at Level 1 near the river as we could hear the show's music too).

On one side of the building you get city views over the bay, and the other side you get the gardens by the bay. Perfect location for plenty of sightseeing activities.

Great at both dawn and dusk with an adult only section. The pool is for residents only and you will need your room card.  Some great bars and restaurants are also up here however be prepared to pay for the view in their prices.

It is expensive $400 a night for the room, $53 for breakfast, etc.. It is exclusive. And there’s an air of elitism here. It’s Fine. But the room is ordinary. I had a view of the convention center roof. (Ask for a higher floor - 10 or above for a better view). And there are many non-guests who are only there for the “Skypark”. Certainly nice, but security and dress codes make walking around a inconvenience.

I was able to have a swim and take the photo but didn't want to stay because of the crowds. The lobby was super busy and I found that a little disconcerting and impersonal.

We had a room on the 27th floor with lovely views of Gardens on the Bay and really enjoyed the nightly music and lights show at 7.45 pm.   Needless to say, the hotel was very busy and with 2500 rooms and lots of day visitors, the lobby was always busy. The greatest asset of this hotel is its staff who were all so friendly and willing to help.  Given how busy the hotel was, check in was fast and efficient, as was check out. This is an iconic hotel and a great feat of engineering which amazed us.  If you want a pool you can swim in or have available beds by the pool, stay somewhere else.  We never once got a sunbed by the pool although…",3,Positive

186,"enjoyed the laser show. quite crowded on the promenade, could be a better view from top floor. they have two shoes at 8 and 9 pm . Hotel charges tourists a whopping fee per person for a short visit to skydesk. then theres the queue. it becomes quite an amount for a large family. instead a one day stay could be a better deal. as one can visit many places nearby and within the hotel at leisure. one has to walk a lot in Singapore. must plan for a weeks stay minimum to see few of the attractions and part of the city. Thogh the MRT & busses networks excellent one must have  budget for taxis as well. research well for food. very hot during the day so plan activities in morning, keep afternoon for rest and go out in evenings to return late",4,Positive

However the hotel itself is already dated (still have to pay for movies) plus it is a big hotel, so the expectation of good service comes with apprehension. The TV in our room would freeze occasionally but we could not be bothered getting any help as we felt it would take ages to get someone to come. Having said this, we do not have proof. Everyone we encountered was pleasant & efficient. We travelled with a child & had to have the family room. It was too big really. Our child’s sofa bed was in our room plus there was a separate lounge & dining room. The amenities of having a casino (if it is your…",3,Neutral

We had a garden facing  room which had lovely views , room was Spacious  and clean,   As for the pool it wasn't as busy as i thought so we had no problems finding sun loungers and room for the selfies!!, they have bar staff coming round serving snacks and drinks ( yes expensive)  but as i said just accept  it and enjoy the experience , definitely recommend  this place !!",5,Positive

And when we check out i let the frontdesk to asked their staff to check our room. Theybasked me if we consumed anything from the fridge i told the none. But when we are in our country a day after we left Singapore they emailed me that they will charged me a drink because it was not in their fridge.

The prices on the 'in-room' dining menu were equally awesome, breakfast for two was over $100. Dinner at the roof top restaurant was over $400, a G&T $22 each, a bottle of wine that you might pay $15-$18 in Australia will cost you over $AUD125. The shopping mall mentioned in previous reviews does have the most exclusive brand names in the world however, it is way to expensive to shop there. I did not see one customer in any of the 'top end' shops. You will need ro get a taxi to and from this hotel on every occasion that yo.u wish to see any of the many sights of Singapore. It is too remote to walk anywhere. Good luck if…",3,Neutral

The bathroom has very nice complimentary shampoo and lotions.  The ultimate experience is to spend time in the 'infinity pool' enjoying the view.  The observation deck is an opportunity to view the surrounding gardens and enjoy the amazing light show that takes place on the waterfront.  The Mall that is part of the hotel property is interesting with an abundance of shops & food stalls.,5,Positive

Gardens by the bay is close by as well as a shopping complex with all the top brand shops. The hotel has everything you need plus more.

It was my husbands 60th and we were there with a party of 9 people including family and friends of ages between 25 & 60. Most of the group would not have stayed here before or even visited Singapore. We had a fantastic experience thanks to Sherman who made our stay and my husbands 60th just perfect. Thank you Sherman it opened my eyes yet again just how special Singapore is and confirmed that Marina Bay is the best place to stay. Highly recommend.

The infinity pool was amazing, with incredible views, and we enjoyed lots of time up there, including free access to the SkyPark viewing deck. However, the rest of the stay there proved just as good. It is worth saying though, the hotel complex is absolutely huge and very busy, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.  Our stay started well, as check-in was incredibly smooth and helpful. We checked our suitcase in, as we thought as it was 12pm, our room wouldn't be ready. There was no need to do this, as our room was ready to check in to - fantastic!

On arrival we were taken out of the long check-in queue to the VIP check-in, this may have accounted for the stunning room on the 32nd floor. Our luggage was stored then later taken to our room. Our room wasn’t ready but we were given a pass to use the hotel facilities, and after we checked out were invited to shower in the gym before flying back to the UK. A note in the room to introduce our housekeeper and assure us that if anything was not in order then to let her know. And in any case, it’s a stunning building both in design and materials.",5,Negative

Top tip, if you pay to go to the observation floor you have to buy tickets and there are no benefits on that floor apart from amazing view. If you buy tickets for the Sky Bar which is in the 57th floor they give you vouchers to the same value as your tickets which you can spend at the bar, so in reality the view costs you nothing. Food and drink are available and the views are incredible. ",5,Positive

Great views, clean room, great bathroom and comfy beds. The pool definitely is amazing with stunning views to the lion city. The staff was friendly, but you really get treated as a tourist or as a wealthy person which some guests might be used to or like. We didn't have any breakfast at this hotel, it is way to expensive!

Check In – Check in was a little slow but the staff were coming around with drinks to keep everyone refreshed in the queue. We arrived early and the room we were told would not be ready for another hour.

I walked away and returned 10 minutes later to speak with someone who was able to solve the problem very easily.  We had three rooms in total, 2 on the 30th floor and 1 on the 19th.  The 30th is obviously better to see the lighting show and also access the pool on the 57th floor.  The lift servicing the 19th floor terminates at 22, you then change lifts to reach the top, so we spent a great deal of time in and out of lifts!!

The club rooms are amazing and we'll worth the money, especially for the view. The club lounge on the other hand was good, but not as good as other 5* hotel we have stayed in. We had to register in a room tucked away in the corner of the building, which was smart and comfortable with hot and cold drinks at our disposal.

Go to the pool as often as possible, although crowded most of the time the experience is truly memorable. If you stay until 11 PM when the pool closes, you'll be able to take some great night-time pictures.

My family went to the famous rooftop swimming pool during the afternoon and at nighttime. Both hours had simply magnificent views of the city and sea.I also tried out the rooftop bar later on.

Our room was not ready and we took a visit at Gardens by the Bay. Lunch at Satay by the bay (very good!), back to hotel at 2pm and lift to infinity pool (WOW!!!).

We arrived at just after 10 and within seconds you are deposited at the top to be greeted by friendly staff and to this amazing view. Drinks are expensive but not much more than you would pay in any 5 start hotel and whilst charged $56 to go to the top it is given back to you with drinks.  What a fabulous few hours spent looking at the view and having cocktails and just very relaxing. Hotel looks great and just amazingly built. Huge recommendation to see if only for the view.We were not allowed into the pool area as we were not guests but saw lot's of people in gowns coming from the pool and they looked happy.,5,Positive
239,"The Hotel is clearly a must when visiting Singapore. In my personal opinion, the hotel is like a Mall, with a lot of people, the check in process is not very fluent, even though we were offered water and Ice creams while waiting, still slow.  If you want to swim in the famous pool, you must stay in the hotel, besides that, the hotel is more an tourist attraction than a place to rest and enjoy the city. Is very well located, so you could probably visit Singapore and stay the whole place (Hotel, Pool, Mall, etc) so it is up to personal choices.",4,Neutral

However, due to it being so popular it does have a 'conveyer belt' feel to the stay. There are always masses of people checking in and out and pool itself gets very hectic. The rooms are very nice and well kept, but nothing exceptional.  It's definitely exciting to stay there and enjoy the facilities, but it's not a luxury hotel experience!",4,Positive

MBS is not a cheap hotel, however we recommend paying extra to get a club room as the service and food quality of breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés is outstanding as is the free flowing champagne offered in the early evening (piper-heidsinck).

245,"My wife and I had a 3 night stop over in Singapore and set 1 night aside to stay here as it was something we had wanted to do for years. Our experience was extremely disappointing and left us wishing we had just stayed at the Pan Pacific where we spent the the 2 nights previous and was by far a better hotel. The service at Marina Bay Sands was terrible. The staff were slow, rude and really unhelpful. I’m guessing they reserve the best service for those arriving in Bentley’s or who are wearing Rolex’s. The room was very underwhelming and the hotel had the fell of a shopping mall. Then there was the pool. Wow it was awesome to spend the afternoon in a pool with a thousand other people. I’m sure my review would have been better if it wasn’t for the atrocious service we experienced…",2,Neutral
246,"Due to the size of the hotel be prepared to wait to be checked in. You do have an option of not paying a deposit that will keep the fridge locked.  The best thing about the room are the views. Otherwise the room looks pretty average. What was nice was the electric blinds theat open automatically as soon as you enter the room, 3 ply toilet tissue and the TWG tea bags but no bidet in the toilet. The shower functional but basic. The views from the obsevation deck are amazing. Best has to be the infinity pool that goes to the edge of the building. You can tell from the skypark this is no ordinary hotel. I would recommend at least spending one night so you can experience the skypark as its only available for the hotel guests. The other benefit is the gardens by the bay,the water…",4,Neutral
247,"We stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit to Singapore. The hotel is everything you would expect and the staff and food were both absolutely excellent, but the pictures do not do the infinity pool justice. Its simply stunning, with views out over Marina Bay on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other. And, surprisingly its not crowded, there are lots of loungers available to watch the Singapore skyline from.",5,Positive
248,"We had the best sleeping and waking moments with an awesome view of Gardens by the Bay. Service was superb. Our room was cleaned several times a day. The staff were all courteous, very attentive to all our requests and honest. I left ex gratia for the housekeeping every time but nobody took them so I enclosed them with a thank you note on our last day.  Don't miss cocktails by the pool during sunset. It's a bit crowded while we were there but the view was so amazing so we didn't mind having a lot of photobombers. It's absolutely on the pricey side but with the kind of service we've experienced, I wouldn't mind coming back.",5,Positive
249,We spend 4 nights at the Marina Bay Sands hotels and we had 2 connecting skyline view rooms.  The service was excellent from the arrival at the airport to the return.  The view and the roof top pools are unique and are worth the experience.  We enjoyed the food court next door as a much more relaxed atmosphere and huge variety of choices.  The hotel can be quite busy at time with long queues at checking or check out but we were spare those by check-in in the room.  We definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Singapore. ,5,Positive
250,"This is simply the place to stay in Singapore. Choose a room with city view (Deluxe with Sky View are perfect) and you will be delighted. Perfectly located, with plenty of services and amenities like the famous infinity pool (a bit crowed) and the sky deck.  Simply wow!",5,Positive
251,"Even you can't afford to stay in this hotel, there are things you can do at low cost or no cost. The food court here is not as expensive as the restaurants in the hotel.  There are two light shows every night at the Garden by the Bay as well as another one in front of the Bay, both are free.",5,Positive

She Was very professional and accommodating, alongside her trainer Aram who was very helpful with our requests.  Marina Bay Sands is a great place to visit, and wouldn't be the way it is without the friendly staff whom I encountered.",5,Positive
254,"Check in is slow, the large foyer is currently under constructions will likely be more welcoming when completed. We had booked two rooms and we were split on to different floors (irritating) Elevators are also slow and you need to swipe room key wait for board to flash and then press floor. We paid for the premium rooms and one certainly was - the other was not. The room on floor 27 had an obstructed view, no verandah and was very dank smelling (like a laundromat). Floor 29 had sweeping views of the gardens from the verandah. The toiletries are very high quality. Rooms are reasonably clean, blandly dressed and not in brand new condition with reasonable wear and tear, the design layout is impractical in part (bathroom and toilet lights are located next to door, toilet and shower…",4,Positive
255,Great thing about staying at MBS is you do not need to leave the hotel. Singapore is so hot and humid I don’t want to leave the hotel. We came for the new Marquee. Cut steak and Blossom were delicious. Adrift have great cocktails and Lavo great view. Marquee was fun. The food court is open 24/7 so great place after club. Room was spacious love our housekeeper.   Minus one star when we got off taxi nobody came to help us with our luggage. I told the front desk and couple guys were free standing around.,4,Positive
256,"When booking this hotel I had doubts that it would be worth as much per night as a Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental (all are on the Marina Bay). But upon check in I knew I had made the right choice! For reference, I had booked the Premier Room City View.  Firstly, they let me check in at 7:00 AM! I was expecting them to say the room wasn't ready, but they were very accommodating and gave me a room right away. Upon entering the room I could see why this is a 5-star hotel. Great room and amenities.   Second, the POOL is INCREDIBLE! I am not a huge sit by the pool and do nothing person, but here, I spent hours in the pool and sitting by it. Where else can you be 57 floors up swimming around looking over the city?! This was very, very impressive! The pool alone is worth spending…",5,Negative
257,"We stayed here on 28th May one night on way to aus. A experience to remember, a fabulous iconic hotel that deserves its reputation. View from 18th floor garden view was spectacular.Could easy become impersonal due to size but this is negated by staff being so helpful and willing to please.Even buffet breakfast in any of designated restaurants was excellent.The person who seats you once learns your name Thanks you by name as you leave helps keep it personal. Also who can leave without mentioning infinity pool on top floor this was worth the one day visit on its own",5,Positive
258,Stayed for layover night in a Premier City View Twin room. Very spacious. Twin bed too small to sleep with kids. Should be queen size for that. Pool was crowded as expected.  Positive atmosphere was caused by sunset and dawn light. Spago cocktails and sushi quite good but not special enough for the prices. Overall very impressive hotel if you are looking for crowded environment wherever you go.,4,Positive
259,"If you haven't had a chance to stay in this hotel, then you should do.  This is my April visit to this hotel and I put some infinity pools photos at night.  It was beautiful scenery from 57th floors of Sands Skypark especially at evening time.  Love it",5,Positive
260,Stayed at the hotel for one day before flying home and couldn’t have had a better experience. From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. We had been staying in Singapore for a week and so were early for check in. Arriving at about 11am we walked straight up to check in - no queue and was greeted by a lovely lady who explained our room wasn’t quite ready but that we could register which would allow us to get a key and head up to the infinity pool. Amazing! We left our luggage at reception and headed up to level 57. The pool was not too busy at this time so we got seats right on the water. The pool itself is spectacular and a must see if you’re in Singapore. We received a text 30mins later saying our room was ready but decided to stay at the pool. Cocktails are delish and…,5,Positive
261,My family can’t get over the beauty of the skypool. It overlooks the entire city. Safety is being prioritized and people in the pool are supervised with pool guards. You must try atleast once in a life time to go to this place..,5,Positive
262,We recently stayed and it was a wonderful experience. From the moment we entered the foyer the service was second to none. We were ushered to a VIP space to check in and then offered a superb upgrade from level 4 to level 43 and of course we accepted. The fixtures of the hotel and our suite were fantastic. The staff are friendly and super attentive. So glad we got to stay here.,5,Positive
263,"From the outside of the hotel it looks stunning, if arriving at night even more so. Once you step out of the taxi forget any type of personal experience. You become part of the other 5000 people staying there. Staff are rude and you are offered no assistance with cases. Once inside good luck finding where you are meant to check in, especially if you pay the extra for a club room. Once you get to your room be ready to be dissapointed. Club rooms with garden view are smaller than rooms on the other side of the hotel (cleverly you are shown the large room even if you book a garden room... naughty). The infinity pool is impossible to get to with every man and his selfie stick vying for space. Trying to find a spot for a drink in the evening which felt luxurious was impossible. Worth…",3,Neutral
264,"Wow. What a hotel. The architecture, rooms, views and staff are incredible. Didn't want to leave here. Club access gave a huge room, afternoon tea, Champaign etc. Breakfast on top floor was incredible and enjoyed the pool. Can't wait to come back ",5,Positive
265,"Best way I can describe MBS is if McDonald’s was a hotel it would be Marina Bay Sands. It genuinely feels like a drive through. There is nothing really wrong with it, it just feels impersonal and detached.  Architecturally it’s a marvel of engineering but it lacks the most important bit... personality.  The pool attracts the worst kind of visitors, the social media influencers and bloggers. Selfie here, selfie there, take a photo of everything I’m consuming. Oh and Russians. Those pesky Russians and their desire to wear the hotel provided robe and slippers from their hotel room on level 4 all the way to the pool on level 57. For some reason the rest of the folk follow that trend.  Breakfast at Rise is simply outstanding, pay the money folks and enjoy a great breakfast. Lavo,…",3,Neutral
266,Too popular with tourists. Meaning even upgrade areas are busy. Not as central as other hotels but does have good views. Good food options. Shops aligned are high class. Staff are great and well trained,4,Positive
267,"We decided to stay here for one night during our recent visit to Singapore, it lived up to all our expectations and more. The infinity pool on the top is amazing and offers panoramic views of this amazing city. The hotel offers so much to see and do. Check in was easy and we were able to check in early and leave our luggage whilst being able to access the pool and observation deck. The view from our room was gorgeous as we had a garden facing room in tower 3. We watched the tree show from our balcony, truly beautiful. We were able to eat within the hotel with a child and felt welcomed. The shopping available within the hotel is on another level and whilst we weren’t there to spend, we enjoyed the experience of walking through seeing all that sparkles!",5,Positive
268,this was my third visit to this hotel so as we had arrived around 2 pm in the afternoon and we had booked some higher category rooms we were in the ever waiting check in queue more in the front and were lucky that our rooms were ready as still some people were asked to wait as check in time is 3 pm and check out time is 11 am they really need a lot of time to get the rooms done > the lobby as usual crowded as if the rooms are for free and mind you this prices here are not cheap> now for the good things the rooms as usual good > the shopping mall and the casino it has all what else you need and to top it all the infinity pool just amazing loved it the service and the cocktails at the pool deck just amazing > one word Enjoyed my stay,5,Positive
269,"Excelent location to see night show at the gardens and laser show. Room is average and has my pet hate auto mini bar. Pool is good but far too busy. Resort on a whole is way too touristy. If you are going to stay here do it for a night, tick the box and go somewhere else. There are many better options in Singapore.",3,Neutral

272,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on a 3 night trip for a friends birthday.  Checking in was no problem and our room was up graded. The room was very clean with views out to the garden and sea.  The infinity pool opens at 6am and this is probably the best time to go get a lounger by the pool, we were still on uk time so this was not a problem. The pool does get very very busy but it is a must to visit and see Singapore from a high height.  The hotel is very large with three towers. Again it does get very busy but the size of the hotel can accommodate this. There are several restaurants and bars around to visit. Try happy hour!!!!!  There is a large shopping mall under the hotel with all the worlds top designers which my wife found to her delight.  All in all this was a great hotel…",5,Positive
273,"I stayed at MBS one night because it was too expensive to stay for the entire length of our trip to Singapore.  You have to stay there to actually use the infinity pool but outside guests can go to the top to take pictures without being in the pool. Though definitely luxurious and we don't gamble and we thought it the location was just so-so.  We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel because Singapore is all about the hawker stands.  We did like that it was close to Gardens by the Bay but it's proximity to everything else was a little bit far for walking. We moved to a boutique hotel in Chinatown afterward and liked that vibe a lot more.  Besides the pool, it was just another very big and over the top and overrated hotel but still a great experience just for that one…",4,Positive
274,"The Infinity Pool is certainly great and the view from the hotel rooms is rather nice. But to be honest, that's it. I've stayed in this hotel a few times now but I probably won't return. The hotel is way too big and you have the feeling of being on a market rather than in a five star hotel. There are much better places to stay in Singapore if you are looking for beautiful and luxurious rooms as well as personalized and polite service (e.g., Raffles, InterContinental, Fullerton).  We also visited the bar and the drinks were average (if at all). Interestingly, however, the bar keeper did not engage with us nor was he friendly above average, but he gave everyone a card with his name asking to write a positive TripAdvisor review about him. Well.. Looks like this place is desperately…",3,Neutral

276,"Utterly amazing! Booked a club room which allows access to lounge book in rather than front desk, treated like VIP’s, we were upgraded to a suite which was such a wonderful surprise! What this hotel manages to do is make you feel special despite many visitors and lots of tourists. Once in the tower blocks the busyness outside melts away, you truly feel you have exclusive access to one of the most amazing hotels in the world! The suite was breathtaking with views that surpassed anything experienced before. Every need is catered for, bath products fabulous and the beds and pillows so comfy. Staff are so attentive everything is thought of and when needed so prompt in their service. Club rooms are the way to experience this hotel, the club 55 access was superb, food exceptional at…",5,Positive
277,I was lucky enough to spend nearly a week at the stunning Marina Bay Sands at a work conference.  It really didn't disappoint.  Of course you can't really swim in the infinity pool - its for taking selfies and watching the sunset!  And yes its absolutely huge but I found the service excellent and my room was beautiful. I had a view out on the bay and could lie in bed and happily watch the lights of the city.  Just magnificent.  There is a massive shopping centre below (some high street but mainly high end!) and lots of restaurant choices - my favourite was Lavo.  I would definitely splash out to spend another night in this gorgeous spot!!,5,Positive
278,Worth visiting on any trip to Singapore. Accessible from any part of Singapore by Taxi Rooms are not only bigger in size but have fabalous view. Breakfast is excellent and includes  Indian Menu. Reception staff is courteous.,5,Positive
279,"The world famous infinity pool is not to be missed.  The hotel is huge with top service. However because of its size and modern design it is more like a hub than a luxury hotel.   Other than that, the restaurants and service is second to none. Definitely worth at least a 1 night stay to experience the pool and stunning views.

We were on the 51st floor, and had a great view of the city and the light show that was being presented on the bay each night we were there. Our room was not cheap, but included access to the infinity pool and Club 55 for pre-dinner drinks and nibbles. However, we found that if you did not arrive at Club 55 right on 5pm, you often could not get a seat and so missed out on the drinks/nibbles included in your room price. Also, although the infinity pool offered great views it was soooooo crowded, and getting a seat was virtually impossible. If we were to stay here again I would definately book a cheaper room - lets face it, we will still be close…",4,Positive

Located at Bayfront MRT station and steps away from the lively Central business district. This place has everything for you to spend an awesome and relaxing time. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 33rd floor: the view from our balcony was truly amazing and breath taking. We we're extremely happy about the overall experience of this hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with all the basic amenities. We would surely stay there again. Looking forward to a wonderful chance to come back to Singapore. ",5,Positive
282,"This hotel is the Icon of Singapore and just amazing to stay.  Service is incredible and the room does not disappoint.  I booked this a year in advance and did get a reasonable price but it can be pricey.  Our room was oversized and had a 12'x12' balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay.  We were able to watch the light show at night and even hear the music since we were on the 25th floor.  The hotel has a huge shopping and restaurant area and casino.  You can get lost here!  The infinity pool on the 57th floor in the Skypark is something that you just have to see.  Its amazing and so cool because there is an adult only pool, keeping the kids at a distance.  Plan on spending some time at the pool and especially go at sunset and enjoy the night lights of the city.  It was one…",5,Positive

Service is spotty and often unpersonal, unfriendly and inattentive. The pool area is very crowded.  Food outlets are all pricey, but with good quality.  So we ticked this one off our list of places too visit and enjoyed the spectacularness of the place. But it’s quite unfortunate that they have not succeeded to keep the personal touch that visitors expect when paying top dollars.  ",4,Neutral
284,"We are regular visitors to Singapore and always like the idea of staying at MBS to be able to use the pool. The pool did not disappoint- views are spectacular. We have been up to the rooftop bar on previous visits but it is so lovely being able to use the pool. Rooms are lovely and have all the needed amenities, however this is a corporate style hotel and therefore the rooms are quite basic in style. We had a harbour view over looking gardens by the bay. We loved staying and cocktails by the pool are great! They are pricy if you are used to uk prices however they are online with Singapore alcohol prices.",4,Positive

286,"We stayed 1 day at this hotel and I think this is enough because it is very expensive and not too luxury from inside. The club lounge was a little bit disappointing because the food was not as good as I expected and it was very crowded so that sometimes people had to wait outside the club until there will be places. Moreover, the queues for the registration to the hotel was very big (for those who take the lounge access they have another queue in another room which is great and fast). The big big big advantage of this hotel is the 57 floor - the pool. It is so amazing !!! So beautiful and the cocktails there were great! It is mandatory to be there!!! Overall, we liked the hotel and it was great to be there for 1 night.",5,Neutral

Breakfast very expensive $100 for two people.we went over to the shopping centre and had dinner at The Nostra Cucina restaurant we had pizza and it was lovely, great service as well.

If you have a Club Room you get to check in at a seperate area to the right of normal check in, which was much quicker.  Don’t forget to take a number when you arrive and enjoy the free water or coffee whilst you wait. Despite requesting an early check in, and yes, I know this is not guaranteed, the room wasn’t ready at 1.00 so we went off to explore the shops and awaited the SMS to tell us the room was ready. As it happens we were busy looking around and so headed back to reception at 4.00, no SMS received.

We went for a swim at 2100 and again at 0600 and it was bliss, much quieter than the day and no problems finding a poolside lounger.

Felt like I was queuing for a Ryanair flight. The room was starting to look run down as it clearly has not been touched up since the venue opened 9yrs ago. Definitely not 5* compared to other hotels in Singapore. Staff are generally helpful but clearly they are overworked with the sheer number of hotel guests.   The pool was an mixed experience.

After a while of ignoring him he left.  Anyway leaving a review here wouldn’t make a diff anyway as their management team will only copy paste a standard reply to everyone as this hotel is way too commercialised compared to when they first launched it.  Not my choice of hotel but since family wants I’ll follow. Otherwise I would pick Marriott Group hotels anytime over MBS’s commercialise, full of tourists, so busy, bad internet and nobody really cares about you. Service is certainly not 5 stars - hotel is so big seriously nobody knows you. ",2,Negative

307,"Place was good with a-lot of activity inside marina bay good for shopping and casino , eating out Very good i do recommend,   but about the Hotel i feel so so compared to Ritz Carton and price more expensive than other place   ",3,Positive
308,"My husband and I were spending a few days in Singapore and having heard wonderful things about this iconic hotel, we decided to break our budget and book a one night stay (it’s not cheap, I tell you!).  Was it worth the money? ABSOLUTELY! We arrived at Tower 1 at around 10am. Check in is usually around 3pm but the front desk were very friendly and kindly allowed us to have an early check in without further cost.  We booked a garden bay view room and it absolutely lived up to its name! The view from the balcony was amazing! We could see the towering Supergrove Trees and a beautiful view of Singapore.   The room itself was above average. Spacious, comfortable bed and a huge stand alone tub.  However, the main attraction of the hotel HAS to be the Infinity Pool. As we had only…",5,Positive
309,"Room 1909 We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands, on the 18th April 2019, for 1 night It was amazing. We were greeted by the porter upon arrival, check in with Wati, who was very professional. We went to our room, of which was spotless, lovely interior a lovely balcony. At 7:30pm we had a knock at the door, to my surprise a Birthday cake was delivered, as it's my Birthday this month. We then visited the infinity pool, located on the 57 floor, wow wow, what a experience, can view Singapore 180 degrees. We absolutley loved the hotel, . We also found a food court, where we could sample the local foods. I have been in the catering industry for over 19 years, and have never experienced such, passionate team of staff, it was a delight. I will be returning.",5,Positive
310,"I will try to cut this short. Me and my husband have been to many nice places, hotels in all price categories. We wanted to start off our honeymoon with this supposedly hotel, then move on to Indonesia but unfortunately got disappointed as soon as we had checked in. They gave us not the bay view room we paid for, repeatedly they tried to tell us that garden view was bay view but could not respond to our question where the difference in price came to be. We are currently waiting at the front desk and nobody wants to help, either they say nobody is there or available at the moment. Sorry, but taking somebody’s money and not giving them what they bought and not being willing to return the money is fraud, no matter how nice you say it or how much you apologize. Terrible experience,…",1,Negative
311,"This hotel has everything!! The landmark of Singapore.....everything is so well organized from the check in to check out....recommend club room....then you have your own VIP check in room with leather seats and drinks, and the rooms are better and you have your own free club Lounge where you can eat and drink as much as you want.....and the swimming pool at the roof is just so amazing and spectacular.....and you have to try the restaurant and bar on the top.....soooo nice in the evening.....have fun",5,Positive
312,"Checking in again after 4 months , chose a garden view premier room. Got a 9th floor with great view. However need to change lift in order to get to the pool. As Low floor does not direct access to the pool. Compare to my previous stay at the city view room. Garden view room felt more warm due to the sun. But for smoker garden view room will be a better choice as you can smoke in the balcony. Overall experience still great.",5,Neutral
313,"My first stay several years ago was very impressive, but nothing has changed. Our room in tower 3 was average at best, hard bed and queen size at best. The poolside, thread bare towels and way too crowded. Time for new experiences in Singapore.",3,Neutral
314,The convenience and quality of the Club55 experience was worth the added cost of the Club level room. Room was very spacious and quite luxurious. Exceeded our very high expectations. Definitely recommend city view.,5,Positive
315,"The views are fabulous, rooms are spacious, and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you like an enormously large Las Vegas style hotel, with very high end shops and a casino, you might enjoy staying here. However, be prepared for hordes of people (there are around 2500 rooms in three towers); and forget about actually swimming in the rooftop pool!  The restaurants in the hotel and the shopping complex are over-priced, so best to check out the many other choices in Singapore.",3,Neutral
316,This is definitely NOT the cheapest hotel I've ever stayed in but it maybe the most spectacular one. It towers over the bay in Singapore and looks amazing. The infinity pool is without a doubt the best thing about this hotel and is worth a visit during the day and also at night. We stayed for a week and were still finding new areas to explore. There's also an MRT station (Bayfront) underneath the Marina Bay Shopping Mall which makes getting around the city really easy. Hopefully I'll be able to afford to go back someday. ,5,Positive
317,Believe the hype. Close to so many attractions and attached to the shopping mall and casino. Our room was large and comfortable with amazing views. When ordering room service breakfast please note that they give you huge portions enough for an army. The pool is worth the price and lives up to the hype. We were lucky and got to checkin early. Our bags made it quickly to our room and checkin was a breeze.,5,Positive
318,"After six and a half years, we arrived at our final night in Singapore. We knew the perfect destination - Marina Bay Sands. As usual, amazing pool, amazing staff and an amazing room. Facilities were great and just overall perfect.",5,Positive
319,"I can't find anything wrong with my stay. The hotel was amazing, the pool was unreal and staff were on point. The 24 gym amazing, rooftop bars and shopping. Everything you need this hotel has it. My room was on the 32rd floor with city view in tower 2 and we had the best view of the city sky and light show.",5,Positive
320,"This is one of the most amazing places we have ever been! If you visit Singapore, it would be a mistake not to visit and definitely stay at the hotel! The rooftop pool and bars are amazing! The view is breath taking - just watch some YouTube videos. I definitely recommend it!",5,Positive
321,We went for a tea time drink on the roof top bar and watched the amazing balmy day turn to night. Beautiful view and setting.   You pay an entrance fee of about S$45 however you redeem this against your drinks (if you remember... unlike us who had to get more drinks to use the voucher!)   View out the back of the Botanic Gardens too.,5,Positive
322,... stayed in iconic Marina Bay Sands x 1 night during our 2 nights/3 days trip and WOW !....the night before we bought evening Singapore tour including light/music show in Gardens by the Bay and went for a night cruise around the bay...the next day we changed the hotel for MBS (they checked us in before check in time and the room is huge )...at lunch time we took self driving shuttle (5$ ) from to MBS to Gardens by the Bay (GBB) where we spent x 4 hours ...went to Sky walk and then for 15 min. guided tour around Gardens and the rest we spent in Flower Dome and Cloud Forest...fantastic !!!..at 6p.m. I headed to the world famous Infinity pool (must be a hotel guest to enter) for a swim and unforgetable sunset  over the spectacular Singapore skyline..at 8 p.m. I watched again the…,5,Positive
323,"Fantastic hotel, if you can, book this one for your stay in Singapore! Awesome roof top breakfast at the infinity pool! Impressive sight, great service. Lots of things to do in walking distance; Garden by the Bay etc.",5,Positive
324,Stayed here for 2 nights and were very lucky to be upgraded to a whopping suite. So huge we lost the 3 kids. We felt very privileged to stay in such an enormous suite with a jaw dropping view of the bay. It was fun and reminded me of Las Vegas hotels. This type of hotel would not be top of my list normally but I think it’s got to be done if like we were visiting Singapore for the first time.,5,Neutral
325,"Although expensive, we would highly recommend that staying at MBS is worthwhile. We had two rooms for the 4 of us (children 11 and 14 years), on 35th floor, overlooking the city and Marina Bay. Huge and spacious. Excellent amenities. Stunning views, and had a beautiful view of the Spectra light show, from our rooms. Excellent location - within easy walking distance to Marina Bay, Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, and even Chinatown. A treat to swim in the rooftop pool (although VERY crowded and popular), and views in both directions (towards the city, and over the Gardens) were spectacular. The highlight of our 5 night stay was waking at 7am one morning and going for a peaceful, relatively cool walk through Gardens by the Bay and watching the sunrise.",5,Positive
326,Again very beautiful at night the organization behind the show with all the light dancing in the front parade. My son had only seen n heard of the Merlion on YouTube videos prior to our visit imagine his happiness when he could actually take a pic like on YouTube 😉,4,Positive
327,"We went there for our honeymoon & stayed there at a club room. One thing that I should highlight is we could be able to Marina Bay light show very clearly from the room itself when you select a club room. Foods are so delicious with the access to the club55 restaurant. Unique experience at the famous Infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands. It doesn't feel like a very high end luxury hotel comparing with its price, but its a very good unique experience. Overall experience is very good.",5,Positive
328,"First word that comes to mind? WOW! Marina Bay Sands is one of a kind in all aspects. Its such a unique structure in the lobby, its an instant icon. Checkin was even a great experience! Icecream upon arrival - how good is that! I tell you now, when you first enter the room its a OMG moment, i wont ruin it for you, but its pretty spectacular. Ultimately most people stay for 1 thing - that pool. Yup, the skypark pool is out of this world, and above it! Its a must do in Singapore. We splurged on poolside food and drinks for lunch and was a wonderful experience, we returned to the pool for sunset and it was a moment to savour. You HAVE to stay 1 night here in your life. The rooms are beautiful and well fitted out, luxurious. True 5 star.",5,Positive
329,"Arriving to check in at Marina Bay Sands almost feels like an Airport....it is so enormous!! Check in was smooth and quick, and our room was simply fabulous!! We had a Garden View... which allowed us to watch the nightly Light Show from our balcony! The room was huge...very modern, spacious, clean and minimalist in decor...so restful!! Each evening, our towels were folded into intricate animal shapes...amazing!! We didn't book breakfast, but there are so many top end shops...cafes...street food...bistros ...that there was no need! The complex houses 3 giant Towers, an enormous Casino, lots of shops...and even a canal and gondola to get around the site!! The star of the show is the rooftop Pool, spanning all 3 Towers on the 57th floor! Watching the sun set over Singapore,…",5,Positive
330,"I wason my own  and had a really lovely time there , the water , the sculptures . great place to go for both adults and children  either during the day or at night when the lights are really spectacular . I ate really good chinese food and walked along the waterside just taking it all in ..  ",5,Positive
331,"I attended a conference in the Marina Bay Sands complex, and stayed at the hotel for four nights. I can't fault the room, or any of the amenities – it truly is a wonder.  The only problem with a hotel of this scale is that it's difficult for the service to be personal. The only time I had an interaction with a staff member that felt genuinely caring, it was immediately followed by him telling me his name and asking to be mentioned in a positive TripAdvisor review.  The infinity pool opens at 6am, and getting there as early as possible is well worth it. You get the pool almost to yourself, and watching the dawn from the roof is an experience you won't get anywhere else.",5,Positive
332,"We first stayed at Marina Bay Sands not Long after it opened and to be honest although it was/is an amazing hotel the service let it down. Well NOT any more, we have just left after our second stay many years later and WOW !!! Amazing service in every venue. The rooms are immaculate with loads of space. We were disappointed to leave today ! One of the best stays in a hotel we have had !",5,Positive
333,"Stayed in MBS for my fiance's bday a couple years back. Have always wanted to come back because it is literally the best hotel for a staycation. The room was spacious and had a nice city view overlooking the river. We went to the infinity pool and a tip, it looks even prettier at night 👌 we ordered room service for breakfast the next day and was so impressed that they delivered into the room, set up table and utensils all for us! Wow! 5 stars for sure. Never had a service like this before in other hotels.",5,Positive
334,"although this Hotel isn't rated the best in Singapore, it is for me. I've been visiting Singapore for over 15 years on numerous occasions and in all the Hotels I've stayed in, this is by far the best. You can feel the luxury and beauty of this Hotel from the first time you see it. The rooms are spacious and I selected a view of Gardens on the Bay. What a stunning view but not as stunning as the night view you get when you swim in the worlds highest infinity pool, 57 Floors up. You have to see it to believe it. I could have stayed there looking at the view all night. Service is beyond reproach and it's run like a well oiled machine.",5,Positive
335,There is very little you can fault. The infinity pool is a must see. The food offering is very good. Breakfasts were excellent. And yet for me it was just slightly missing the atmosphere and service one usually expects in a 5 Star hotel. Everything is huge and fantastic. Personally the sheer size means the service not quite up there with say a Shangri-La or Conrad. Worth experiencing though given possibly best location.,4,Neutral
336,"The hotel stands out. We took a high floor king suite over looking the gardens and the port. The hotel has an enormous shopping mall, a casino, a unique pool on the top roof over looking Singapore. Perfect bed confort, spacious room. They have one of the best light shows infront of the shopping mall, access to the gardens as well.",5,Positive
337,"Despite being appropriately dressed in polo shorts long pants and shoes, and being guests in the hotel we were denied a table at the Italian restaurant. Not acceptable way to treat hotel guests. Hotel nice but huge and very impersonal",1,Neutral
338,"This isn't a infinity pool! This is just a rooftop Jacuzzi near to the edge.  I have no problem with the room. It's good. Besides how cheapskate they wanted to ask for charges (or deposit, I forgot) for the bar fridge. Hello your hotel room isn't cheap okay.  The worst was the rooftop Jacuzzi (that they called it infinity pool) that has crockcoach at the drain besides! I complained to the staff and they replied me ""it is okay what. Not inside the pool"" Hello? So you want me to enjoy the view of your dirty drain? And from where the crockcoach came from? If not from the 'pool' itself. ",2,Negative

Great view of the bay, lovely staff, and very good accommodation compared to other hotels in Singapore. The infinity pool is incredible but you are there with 100s of others...so not relaxing! Disappointing that use of pool and breakfast is not included in expensive room rates. All that said would I stay there again...most likely! ",4,Neutral

343,The room was good and very comfortable and so it should be at S$615 a night! The infinity pool and views are spectacular. We stayed three nights and were there especially to celebrate a 50th birthday - no acknowledgement nor good wishes given. I can't help feel that it would be better to stay at another hotel across the way and be able to look at this incredible building rather than stay in it!,3,Neutral
344,"I was excited to be staying at MBS on my last visit to Singapore. On arrival I was surprised at the check in queue and check in experience. Felt like an airport terminal, no attempt is made to make you feel welcome or special. Then you traipse with your bags 100s of metres to your tower, get accosted by security guards making sure you’re a guest and not a tourist. The elevators were packed with guests going up to the rooftop pool so it takes ages, stopping at most floors in the high rise lift.  The room was pretty good and the curtains open on arrival to showcase the amazing views. Bathroom was not 5 star, the ceiling had peeling paint and was patched.  The rooftop pool area was packed and the pool was full of guests with selfie sticks. Too many people in it to make it appealing…",3,Neutral
345,"wow what a place so clean lots of interesting places to see,and the lightshows at night are brilliant we loved singapore people very helpful as well ,great shopping mall with designer shops in .the only thing we couldnt understand that in such a cosmopolitan the only currency they took was singapore dollars we had euros and usa dollars and had to keep finding exchange bureaus ",4,Positive
346,This is the most prestigious hotel in Singapore. It has the well know MBS top deck overlooking all Singapore as well as the famous seathrough borderless swimming pool on top floor which is amazing. The hotel is full of glamorous decorations and huge vases. It is connected to a casino and a luxurious shopping mall. Also connected to the famous Marina Bay Gardens,5,Positive
347,"A few billion $ of construction spent on this amazing three imposing tower blocks with a magnificent view of the city skyline on one side and Gardens By The Bay on the opposite side, makes for one of the most memorable stays in Singapore. Pay a bit more and stay in the Premier rooms on the higher floors which gives you this million dollar view from your balcony.   An absolute must is a swim in their infinity pool overlooking the beautiful Marina Bay and Central Business District skyline. Better to swim evening time when you see the different shades and colours of the sky. Restaurants there are of high quality and great to celebrate a special occasion. My favourite restaurant Osteria is now gone so will need a new favourite.   What’s great about staying here is that the metro…",5,Positive
348,"The room was nice, the pool was nice, the breakfast was nice but at any given time you felt like being at Mumbai or Shanghai main train station during rush hour. My recommendation go for dinner/drink on the roof top and save your money for a less crowded 5 star hotel",3,Neutral

Queue for check-in was ridiculous, but saved by a gentleman that ushered us to the VIP check-in area...phew as we might not have got into the room for another hour. It reminded me of queueing up for rides at a theme park....bit of a shame that, I feel.  Room was located on 43rd floor and was great to have the gardens and harbour view and, a small balcony upon which there was room to stand. As far as the room goes and, compared to other hotels that are not nearly quite so “grand” it was okay, not “wow” or fabulous.

Breaksfast at RISE was from the food point of view ok - but several hundreds of guests without any athmosphere - a continual comming and going - a mass processing.  the hotel itself impressive from the architecture but at ground level busy like a Railway Station  One evening we wanted to dine at LAVO on Skypark in tower1.

Check in was quick and easy in the Sands Lounge at Tower 1, we were even able to check in early at no extra cost, which was great after a long haul flight.  We went to club 55 several times during our stay for both breakfast and drinks with canapés. The food and drinks were very good with lots of choice, service was excellent from all servers.

If that is not what you are looking for then this isn't the place for you. The rooms were comfortable and view was amazing, we were able to see the lights from the Gardens from our balcony The location cant be beat. You can walk directly to the Singapore Bay Gardens.

Of course they are super polite which makes you feel like a VIP :-)  The hotel is an icon, the pool is amazing, the food is great.

It was a real highlight on our 4 weeks trip through Malaysia and Singapore.",5,Positive
356,"Booked for a family of four and was given a room with 2 single beds.   Way overpriced for what you get.  The whole place is like a human zoo.  Too many people not enough staff and an American service attitude that does not work in Asia.  There is nothing here beside the pool, it is amazing but not worth the money they charge to stay for a night.  Save your money spend half as much on a better hotel somewhere else, and google pictures of the pool and you will have a much better stay in Singapore. You will also really enjoy Asian hospitality, not some gordy peice of Las Vegas dropped in the middle of Singapore.",1,Negative

I will definitely book this wonderful hotel again in the near future!",5,Positive

We really appreciated that :)  Rooms seemed much nice than I had expected. We had a large apartment with a living room, two bathrooms and a bedroom. The view was on the Gardens by the bay and was amazing, especially in the evening. By the way, next to the hotel there is a fantastic mall, accessible directly from the hall.

The bathroom was modern and inviting....actually the first hotel tub I would think about bathing in :)   Within the building, there are lots of high end shops and the food court is also rather decent, although there are lots of the same type of options, the food was good.  Also access to the Gardens by the Bay connected to hotel by a walking bridge.  But lets be real, the rooftop pool is EVERYTHING!  The view is stunning and well worth the time spent in and around.  Again, the service was on point.",5,Positive

I bought some Fanta for my Sister Emma, Sprite for my Brother Philip and a Coke for myself! It’s very luxury. It’s very Enormous like really really gigantic.

The view from the top is breathtaking and I couldn’t stop looking at it. We saw both light shows (gardens by the bay at the 7:45pm and just in front of the shopping centre at 9pm).

We arrived early, unfortunately our room wasnt ready yet, but they have a luggage service where the send luggages to your room when the room is ready. The pool is only accessible to hotel guests, and we went around sunset-night and it was not that crowded. The hotel is attached to a mall with high end shops, very accessible. We stayed at Tower 3 and had a beautiful view of Gardens by the Bay, where we were able to watch the show!

374,There is so much to do in this vicinity and the hotel is beautiful. I do have to say that i have stayed in better but given Singapore i think this is of a high standard for them. The pool was brilliant. Great views and not over crowded. Great shopping centre and you must do the light shows and the water laser show. Only downfall is they don't do enough shows! Other thing is everything is very far apart and not great signage around the location therefore you get lost trying to locate things.  For example when we wanted to go to Gardens by the Bay we asked and we were told a long way round when in fact you can go through the hotel itself. You can use your keycard to get discount at the shopping centre which isn't really made obvious.  Also keep your receipts for a tex refund at…,5,Neutral

Our room was on the 26th floor facing the beautiful gardens. The room was immaculate! Can not fault the cleanliness of the room and the professionalism of the house-keeping team who are always an asset to any organisation. The lifts: too slow!! I agree with what sonebody else who wrote in their review that there should be guest only lifts. Lets face it, the infinity pool on the 57th floor is the main attraction and probably the main drawcard. I thoroughly enjoyed the adults only section of the pool so thank you very much to the lifeguards for keeping the pesky kids out of this small area of a large pool. Will i be…",4,Positive

Enquired with concierge to see if we were appropriately dressed (in cargo shorts, tee shirt and loafers) to go up to the 57th floor for a glass of champagne and to admire the view. Advised that a slightly more formal dress code is imposed, every evening, post 7pm. Lobby seemed crazy/manic. Some very pretentious persons trying to make themselves look big or important, at the expense of the really polite and hard working front of house and reception team. Don’t they realise how false and pathetic they make themselves look?? The staff definitely had the upper hand and kept their cool.  Got crammed into a lift heading for floor 57.

However, beyond that, I find it difficult to enthuse about it.  It has over 2,500 rooms and this shows: the service is slow and impersonal.   The dining facilities are frankly not able to cope with the sheer number of guests.  There are queues for breakfast at 7.10 am.  Further, the check in and concierge feel as if they are located in a busy shopping mall.  Yet further, I am fed up with the lifts: every time I want to go up to my room, I have to compete with an army of tourists wanting to travel to the top.  They really ought to have lifts for hotel guests only.  My advice would be to stay at the Raffles and visit the MBS one evening for a…",3,Neutral

Staff was very friendly and welcoming even though we didn't look like the average customer there. Got to check-in early, had a nice room from the 26th floor with a garden view. Floor was silent, not any noises from the corridor or other rooms. Have to recommend the garden view, you get to see amazing sunrises and Garden by the bays supertree light show from your own balcony! Room itself was very good and clean with comfortable beds and even more comfortable pillows and linens. Curtains and lights can be controlled from bed. Good quality…",4,Positive
382,"This hotel is architecturally thrilling, designed by Moshe Safti - he did not disappoint! The view of the Bay is stunning, the horizon edge pool that floats between all three towers on the 57th floor is worth the price of admission.  Ask for a room between the 8th floor and the 25th floor to maximize your viewing excitement.  Rooms are gracious, food in their many restaurants is great.  I recommend Spagos for breakfast (included in the American Plan) and whatever you do  . . .  don't miss the 22 layer chocolate/Peanut butter cake in Lavo lounge near the pool.  Be sure to take in the light show in the sculpture gardens and the water show in the harbor - both are free and spectacular.  This was just plain FUN!",5,Positive

386,this is the go to hotel in Singapore apparently and everyone wants one of the iconic shots of themselves in the roof top pool. However this is a very large hotel with a huge number of guests and although the service is good do not expect five star service and if you want a decent room on a high floor it is worth paying for a club room.The pool is lovely but there are a lot of people enjoying it so it is not a place to go for splendid isolation.

The spacious guest room commanded panoramic view of the sea. Here I really appreciate the craftsmanship of housekeeping who sculpted a rabbit from towels for display in guest rooms!  Upon checking in, I enquired the front desk staff if I could still find a power cable that I left in my room a year before. I must appreciate the helpful staff in searching through their database, found my name, and checked their relevant department. Though I can’t retrieve it since lost and found items would be disposed of within a limited period of time, the caring attitude of their staff is to be applauded.",5,Positive

However for that money, you do get a pretty wide variety of choices.  For sashimi lovers, the large chunks of tuna and octopus will make the price seem less daunting.  There are also stations dedicated to Indian and local Singaporean dishes. Unlike other hotels, the dessert spread is substantial, with a chocolate fountain and a make-your-own soda counter.  I am impressed with the buffet here, which says a lot.  Set under the wide expanse of the atrium glass of the hotel, a section of the restaurant will be bathed in light, a boon to sun worshippers.

Having eventually found it, we were presented with 11 clerks behind 5 terminals. Despite this overwhelming ratio of staff-guest it took a good 13 minutes for our clerk to check us in. This was because he was struggling in his own words '' to find you a room''.

However the basic amenities like toiletries were “cheap” looking. The way drinks in the fridge are secured gave occupants a feeling that they couldn’t be trusted. The bed was really comfortable but the pillows were too soft.  Gym facility was well equipped and clean; the infinity pool was always busy and unpleasantly crowded. Food in and around the hotel are definitely pricey; can’t say the quality or variety (esp those restaurants at Level 1) were great.",3,Positive

I opted to stay in a club room which was a good decision. Checking was in the Sands lounge rather than general check in. This was a pleasant space with small snacks and water (and you get to sit while waiting to check in). Also it provided access to Club55 in tower 2 which we used for afternoon tea and breakfast.   The room was large, clean and luxurious. The beds were comfortable and all of the soaps and lotions were from a luxury brand.

As a hotel, MBS has an excellent reputation, and all rooms are very well appointed. Service is as you'd expect from an establishment that markets itself as ""Asia's best 5-star Hotel"", and the arcitecture is fantastic too.  Excellent access everywhere, and a visit to MBS is incomplete without a trip around ""The Shoppes"" downstairs, the Gardens by the Bay (with their World-famous Supertrees), and a ride on the amazingly clean, graffiti-free and efficient Singapore Rapid Transit Subway system.

The room was ready when I arrived at 5 PM, and the room exceeded my expectations as far as square footage and finishes. The room was also very quiet, despite being on the 6th floor off of the indoor lobby atrium. The scale of the hotel plus the pool and observation deck atop it reminded me of being in Las Vegas.

When we addressed to the staff even with a recording of it they dismissed as a nonissue. Only after we got maintenance up there did they move us rooms and still fully charged us for the first horrible night.

Nothing is really cheap here except if you go Zara or the shops selling sporting goods like Adidas and World of Sports.

Wow!  For the price of 2 deluxe rooms, we ended up with a Straits Suite on the 54th floor!  No idea what we did as a family to deserve this, but we may never experience this level of luxury again.  Baby grand piano, karaoke room, the list goes on and on.  Over 5 times bigger in area than those 2 original rooms combined, and an even bigger upgrade in terms of room rate.  Thanks, MBS!

The lengthy waits for the elevators, the million and ten tourists, it is generally far from everything except Gardens by the Bay, oh, and the uncomfortable beds.

431,"So hard to explain in words about this hotel. It is like a city! Has a mall, casino, bars, restaurants, etc Rooms are very spacious, views are hard to describe, the infinity pool is 150 mts. We are swimmers and swam in the 70 mts lap pool early in the morning. Just worth the stay!",5,Positive
432,"We have just returned from our third trip to the MBS and it is still as wonderful as ever! I really recommend the Club 55 experience, with gorgeous afternoon tea then evening canapés with quality Champagne on the 55th floor, with fabulous staff, who made us feel so special and welcome. This time, we stayed for a week as a treat, and were so sorry to leave. This is one of our best life experiences!",5,Positive
433,"The pool is magnificent... as expected, but the rest was a bit of a disappointment.  We booked a sky view room and stayed on the 50th floor... We expected to be wow'ed but the hotel room had a lot lacking.  The toilet could not flush properly, and even when one tissue is flushed it comes back.  The shower was old and the shower head clogged, the water sprayed in all the directions except for down where it's supposed to go. There were great things about the hotel as well but the room and bathroom is old and in need of a revamp.",3,Neutral
434,"I stayed at the MBS Hotel for four days with my family this March. The hotel offers a spectacular view of Singapore skyline on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other.   The Hotel staff was exceptionally helpful right from the beginning of my trip. The hotel's usual check-in time is 3 p.m. Since I was taking an early morning flight to Singapore, I had requested for an early check-in. The hotel was more than happy to accommodate my request. I appreciate such a hospitable attitude. I've travelled a fair bit and haven't come across too many hotels in South-East Asia who are willing to be so flexible with their check-in and check-out times.   The hotel amenities and services are at par with the expectations that one would have from this kind of a hotel. I strongly recommend…",5,Positive
435,We bought our tickets at a senior discount by going to the Hotel first and joining the Sands Rewards club.  Then purchasing our tickets and going up the elevator to the observation deck.  OMG awesome views and if you go at dusk you can catch both the daylight sights and then the light show at both Gardens by the Bay and on the water within 15 minutes of each other.,5,Positive
436,"We stayed at the MBS for 3-nights and had a wonderful time.  Despite the fact that the hotel is enormous with thousands of guests checking in and out every day the service was exceptional. Our porter personally handled a room change within a few minutes of our arrival in a swift, seamless and genuinely friendly manner.   The highlight is of course the infinity pool and rooftop dining area- this is really bucket list stuff. It gets very busy in the day so I’d recommend going in the evening it’s a little quieter and the skyline looks way better when it’s all lit up.  Lavo serves contemporary Italian food with a large array of options and exquisite desserts. Make a reservation if you’d like to eat dinner at a reasonable time.    Try and book a room as high up as possible - it does…",5,Positive

439,"A friend encouraged me to spend at least one night at MBS on my first visit to Singapore. Since she's one who normally swears-off luxury hotels in favor of hostels, I took her recommendation to heart and am glad I did. The Marina Bay Sands is a gigantic resort and convention hotel. Despite its size, the hotel is a well-oiled machine. The staff is attentive (except at the pool, where it was hard to get the attention of the rushed servers during my midweek visit) and the accommodations are as nice as any luxury hotel. Of course, the real reason to budget at least one night here is to enjoy the truly spectacular pool that lives up to the hype and then some. Once you've had a chance to take a dip (and some photos), spend a couple hours wandering the SkyPark before check-out and then…",4,Positive
440,This is the prominent building with three tower holding up a platform. Atop is the infinity pool which you need to visit at least once. The casino is easy to enter but difficult to exit.

But I mean, there are other legitimacy fancy hotels in Singapore. And is MBS really that “fancy”?  I mean, it’s basically Vegas. The exact same restaurants. A casino. Luxury retail everywhere. And what do you think the ‘Sands’ in Marina Bay Sands is? Yeah, it’s the same Sands as in Vegas.  Check-in was busy, but it wasn’t too awful given how many people are checking in there everyday. And they gave us little ice cream treats! And the staff are friendly.  We ended up in a Club Room. Very spacious room. The bathroom was nice. Especially the shower. The shower could be a very romantic experience. Or dad’s time alone to…",5,Positive
442,"Let's start with the positives:  Like most people, we were there for the infinity pool. That lived up to the hype and provided the most amazing views of the city, although the water was really cold. This hotel is an architectural feat and a well oiled machine. The room we stayed in was a Deluxe King City View Room, which was very spacious. Amy at tower 3 check-in was super friendly, funny and extremely helpful. There is easy access to the MRT, Gardens By the Bay, the helix bridge and the Singapore Flyer.  Now the negatives:  This place is massive! So it takes forever to walk anywhere.

You can see the entire Singapore there, so be sure to sit and at least have a drink.  It cost $22 to get up there, but that money is deducted from your drink.  The surroundings are stupendous also.  It was thrilling to be there, especially since it was one of the buildings seen in Crazy Rich Asians!",5,Positive

The hotel is a very big property and the shopping and dining options just on the property were numerous.  The views from the bar at the top of the hotel were amazing and I think if I went back to Singapore, I might consider another one night stay.   Room was immaculate, service was five stars!  Felt like a queen! ",5,Positive
452,The Marina Bay Sands is worth staying at even if it is only for one night. The hotel is like a city.  Shopping and food court included. And the pool is the best experience ever. It is not the same to buy the pass for the park at the top. It is a small space and you don’t see the pool area from there.,5,Positive
453,"My issue with this hotel is that the property is too big and therefore not very personalized. From a 30 minute line for check-in to an overcrowded pool area, or a lobby where not only hotel guests but also masses of non staying guests are walking, the hotel consistently lacks a relaxing atmosphere. If you like large Vegas properties, Marina Bay is probably a good fit, just be prepared to pay over $500 per night for a standard room. Just go here for a rooftop dinner and stay at one of the beautiful hotels in the city center.",3,Neutral

From the infinity-pool it has a really great view of Singapore. This hotel has a total of 2,560 rooms. The room I stayed in is very spacious and very clean. From my room, it has a really good view of The Botanical Garden. Their room service is also very good.

Booked in for one evening as a stop over but there are better hotels in Singapore. Is it worth it for the infinity pool? Mmm. If you are staying in your room, pool, and use the gym, maybe. Venture downstairs and you no longer feel relaxed.   Overpriced for what it is. ",3,Neutral

It is an amazing building with surrounding gardens and shops.... a mini post code in itself.  Apart from the rooftop area/ pool, which is totally breathtaking, the rooms in the building itself were pretty average and a little smelly to be honest. You could find a nicer room for a cheaper price.   Singapore is very over prices, so be prepared to spend a lot on a regular meal and drink.   Night zoo was fun and educational and again, I’m glad we’ve seen it. Also a carnival was close by which was also fun.   Overall the short stay in Singapore was average and expensive, won’t be rushing back to stay here again.",3,Neutral

They make it so apparent that each guest has to present their own room key to enter the pool area. FYI it costs $100SD extra for another key. The room is spacious, and the garden view is great, however the beds are very firm and the hotel is more of a convention center then a high class hotel. We preferred the room, bed, and location at Mandarin Oriental. ",4,Positive

Only one drawback need to have few more Veg options for Breakfast at Club 55.

493,Its a very crowdy and huge Hotel. We stayed for 2 days. We were at tower 3 in the 27 level. Very impressive view from our room to the city. And very special view from roof top-pool! We appreciated the direct entry to the metro (MRT) below ground level of the hotel.  Warm welcoming in the hotel. While queuing we got mineral water and icecream!  Although very expensive its worth a visit!,4,Positive
494,Lots of reviews on here but we took a club room with the the extra access and afternoon tea and evening canapés included. This is the best it could be from the vast rooms to excellent service. Lots of vain people here but could not spoil our enjoyment and the extra for the the club amenities and freebies are well worth the money - drinks flow and food is more tapas than canapés. This hotel is best left for special occasions as it will make everything else seem mediocre.,5,Positive
495,"We could have spent our entire Singapore vacation in and around MBS and would not have been disappointed.  Before mentioning the Sky Park and amazing pool, there is easy access to Gardens by the Bay, MBS Shoppes, Artscience Museum, casino, river boats, boardwalks, electric scooters, etc.  And  when it is time to explore further, the Bayfront MRT station is on the property. I debated for over a day about spending this much for a hotel before booking the room.  As we were driving away on the last day I showed the bill to my husband, and asked him if it was worth it.  He said absolutely.  Our only regret was that we spent a day of our trip at Sentosa doing over priced average activities when we should have spent the time around the hotel.  The room was clean, comfortable, and…",5,Positive

Very poor customer service! When I requested a refund for the room difference, I was told “no sorry”. I was expected to pay $53 for breakfast when I already paid for a room with full breakfast. This was my first time in Singapore and at this hotel and it will be my last! Poor management, poor customer service and big time scammers.",1,Negative
497,"We had just 2 nights at MBS but we wished it was longer.  We had a Club room in Tower 2 with a lovely view of the bay and the light show.  Check in was easy in the lounge adjacent to the main check-in desk in Tower 1.  Very efficient.  Our bags arrived in our room very quickly.  Afternoon tea at Club 55 was very nice with a nice selection of sweets, include little scones.  Breakfast at Club 55 is a mix of Eastern & Western foods; I tried only the Eastern foods and they were delicious.  Dinner at Lavo was excellent.  Service at the Concierge desk was amazing as was our smooth check-out.  We're already planning on returning in 2 years and couldn't imagine staying anywhere else.",5,Positive

We went straight to the pool at 12.30 their were various sun loungers available the inifity pool was incredible and did start to get busy from 3pm. We found the food and drink prices very reasonable considering the cost of the hotel, a coca cola was $5 and cocktails $19 - $22.

The observatory area at end and gets very crowded at the restaurant there so go early.  If your room is not included in the observatory, You can pay extra to get a pass to go up.

Just one point I would make, because it seems to be a big part of people choosing the hotel is (forgive me pool Gods), and that is the pool deck is not that awesome an actual experience.  Yes, the pool is nice. But its also pretty crowded pretty much all the time and its not particularly large or deep. Its mostly for bobbing around in and, of course, everyone is taking selfies. ALL.THE.TIME. So go, have a bob, have a beer, but its not a thing you'll do for a week. Its mostly a bit like a crowded seal colony with people lying back on the beach chairs taking a few Singapore rays. That being said, the view is awesome at night but…",4,Positive

506,Ok. The hotel is massive and very Vegas in style and yes it has the iconic pool on the roof! I’m pleased we stayed here. Our room was well appointed and spacious but not luxurious. The pool is amazing and worth the hype! I’d recommend the hotel to anyone just to experience all that it has to offer. One of our most memorable dining experiences was at Spago and I really enjoyed our stay! ,4,Positive

Not to be missed. Then they got our room ready before noon and when we got to the room our bags were already there. The hotel in right in Marina Bay so you can walk everywhere. The Shoppes across the street can be accessible from the underground walk to the incredible mall. The light show is beside the mall.

511,yes this hotel is iconic and stunning. We had a marina view on 42nd floor. Rooms were very spacious with all mod cons  but service not quite as expected. Instant coffee in room and in spite of asking for mint tea bags these did not come (not what you expect for The price you pay) The infinity pool although impressive can get very crowded. Breakfast was ok but again restaurants were crowded.  Definately not value for money and while it's a tick off bucket list  I probably wouldn't return even at half the cost.,4,Neutral

Big rooms, lot's of space, lots of restaurants inside the hotel and the best views of the city from the observation deck and the infinity pool. There is not much to say. An excellent experience.",5,Positive
513,Don’t buy the ticket to the Skypark and observation deck. You can get a ticket for $22 SGD pp for the C’est La Vi bar that then acts as credit for food & beverage at the bar. The views are great but make sure you go both sides otherwise you’ll miss out on seeing the pool and that end of the hotel’s view. ,4,Positive
514,"My husband and I stayed here as the first leg of our honeymoon. We don't usually stay at hotels as expensive as this so it was a real treat for us. When it comes to this hotel, I believe you are not just paying for a room. You are paying for the experience, the location, the quality of the staff they employ and obviously the amazing infinity pool on the roof. We had an amazing stay, the room was fantastic as was the view and the location being by the gardens by the bay and the massive shopping center with food court was great. We're so glad we stayed here to experience it and would recommend it.",5,Positive

The service was of course top notch as expected for such a high price tag. It was very convenient having the hotel connected to a mall, the casino, the gardens by the bay and the MRT transportation system and very easy to navigate.

As soon as you arrive the building seems like a busy office with crowds and crowds of people either to and fro from the built in mall or to the boutique shops at ground floor.  The check in counters are buried to one side of the building and are quite congested.  The rooms are spacious but a locked mini fridge and a water dispenser that dispenses the same temperature water as 'cold' or 'room' temperatures at such a high cost of room rate, you begin to wonder what you've paid so much for...

That we were part of an organisation and sometime just another tourist paying too much to take a photo on the rooftop pool. I’m really happy we did it, but I wouldn’t stay there again.  The breakfast at the Spago (rooftop) was delicious, however the understandable queue (so many guest from 3 different buildings) to get in (around 25min) made everything look & taste delicious.

After all I’ve seen when they were building the towers and looked like a scene from a Star Trek movie. My first experience as we entered the cavernous lobby was just that, a very busy yet uninspiring lobby lacking intimacy. I booked a sky view room at the 45th floor with a view of the Marina. The room was large with a good size living area and a large bathroom. The bed was great to sleep in and the view is spectacular. However I noticed the light switches to the bathroom was near the entrance hence at night one has to walk to the door to turn on the lights. And for what I paid for the room they should at least have a Nespresso but no, it was coffee in a sachet, a 2 in 1. Really MBS!…",3,Neutral

The bathroom was quite nice though.  I was concerned about the pool being too crowded but if you stay there long enough (I suggest 2 nights at least) and go up there at different times, you get different experiences. For instance it was quite empty and relaxing during midday (maybe due to leavers checking out at 11am and newcomers not checking in until 2-3 pm as earliest) however it was quite busy around sunset and later on.

We booked to use the club lounge and this was warmly met by the staff who were very nice and remembered us after a few visits. The club is large but it needs to be as many guests have access. It has no feeling of exclusiveness, once full it has the feeling of a cheap cafeteria. There are kids everywhere, no control with them, food on the floor and not cleaned up after they left. This was at multiple tables. Evening drinks should be drinks and some…",3,Neutral

557,"Stayed at MBS for 2 nights with 4 other couples. First timers. Amazing facility where you don't have to go elsewhere to find food and lots of shopping. Food court was amazing!. Check-in staff very professional and accommodating. Had 2 morning breakfast which is up on the 57th floor by the poolside.  Kudos to waiters like Angelo, Rev and James for doing a superb job in taking good care of us. These people are so wonderful and very friendly. We will definitely stay again at MBS next time we travel to Singapore. Almost forgot, the view while you're on the pool on 57th floor is nothing short of spectacular, especially at night. Make sure you give yourself time to relax on the pool- you'll be amazed. You will run out of selfie poses.",5,Positive
558,We had one of the best rooms with great view overlooking river. Unfortunately the room itself is a little outdated. You don’t feel specialty even with upgrades.

The good: - amazing pool and also the rest of the skypark is great  - Nice room with a great view - great atmosphere...its really alive - check inn and check out proces.  What can be better: - I missed the old bathroom amenities. The new merk was less good. - it took considerable time before the amount quaranteed via my creditcard was finally settled. - its expensive.,5,Positive
561,Our third stay and we will never tire of the marvellous rooftop pool and views. Pricey but worth it. Poolside snacks were very good value.

As we didn't get reservations for 1 of the 5 nights at Marina Bay Sands (where we spent the balance 4 nights), we stayed at the nearby Marina Mandarin.  Our conclusion after the 5-day trip was that the Marina Mandarin was BETTER than Marina Bay Sands on all counts, except the choice of restaurants/bars at the latter.  The Concierge Desk is not able to get reservations at in-hotel restaurants for hotel guests. Waiting for Taxis is too long. The crowd at the Lobby is too large for a Luxury Hotel.",3,Neutral

You really do get what you pay for with this hotel <3  Few tips I picked up along the way...   ** before you check in you need to check with some of the staff hovering by the check in queues which tower you are staying in.

564,"It’s clearly the most iconic hotel in Singapore but after staying there for two nights in a Club Room, it’s way overrated and overpriced - and thus the rating here at 2 stars.    It was a nice room - but nice in terms of a mid range hotel brand nice.  It’s also just a massive complex that there is no sense of personalisation and you are truly just a number at this hotel. There is also very little public areas to congregate, sit or wait in the lobby.   It does have great views of the gardens and is convenient if you plan to just shop and gamble.  The pool was nice but again was underwhelming and rather crowded.  I’d recommend a stay some place else and swing by for a drink on the rooftop at one of their bars.  ",2,Neutral

You have to wait in a fairly long queue to check in but once you do the staff are very helpful but because my cards were on a security lock whilst I was abroad they locked the mini bar, so we couldn't even put the complimentary waters or anything else in there.The rooms are huge with a great view across the bay and with every facility you could want but with what you are paying so you should have.

573," Feedback following a recent two night stay in a twin room in a low room on Tower 1.  The room was nice; very clean, comfortable and spacious. However due to the large size of the hotel (which feels more like a conference center) and it’s design, our room was overlooking the reception counter / lobby area at the very front of the building and didn’t feel very private. In saying that, I was surprised that the room was quiet and we didn’t hear much noise from the lobby.   However the main reason one would stay here is for the Sky Park/infinity pool and I was overly impressed with this, and would stay again purely to access these facilities.  Due to the size of the pool and number of restaurants, there was always sufficient space and room to sit. Excellent views. ",5,Neutral

The rooms had very updated amenities (ie. automatic curtains) and were definitely above-average for hotel rooms.  The pool of course had the amazing infinity pool, however the rooftop lacked any seats with shade near the pool. It would be nice if there were some umbrella to cover some of the chairs, because being up there without any protection from the sun is a little overwhelming. The pool does have a blocked off section for adults-only which is nice if you are travelling without children.",4,Positive

Beyond the actual room itself, I don't think there's anything special about the hotel.   Pros:  - The room was new and clean. I really liked how there were outlets everywhere, including USB ports. Definitely very helpful.  - It's convenient, plenty of public transport option - Obviously, it's central to Gardens by the Bay, which is a huge plus.

It is a very busy place and a tourist attraction in itself. This doesn’t always help the ambience. The oool deck is the taking point. Again, very busy, but people come and go and so we were able to find beds, but not instantly. Food provision, very good. Had an issue over a breakfast charge but it was resolved but not easily. I did have to raise a complaint. Overall, we are glad we stayed. It was enjoyable. It is difficult for these type of hotels to be truly a “luxury” experience when they are so big and busy. I think check in and check out could be made more efficient and management more visible. ",4,Neutral

587,I totally get the appeal of this hotel. The pool on the rooftop is second to none. It is incredible to spend time up there and enjoy the views of the city while in the infinity pool. However this is not an inexpensive hotel and given the rates one must pay and expect significantly better rooms.

Don't expect Ritz-Carlton/Taj/Peninsula like comfort, accommodations, or service. The Marina Bay is more like a Las Vegas type ""five-star"" property. Everything was fine, but it's a gigantic place and more an impersonal mega-resort than a luxury hotel. If you have never been to Singapore (we had not), it's almost a must.

613,We stayed here in April 2018. We were upgraded by the lovely woman on the desk as it was our anniversary. The room was spotless and absolutely gorgeous.

The MBS check in procedure is a bit hectic with long queues. There wasn't really any where to so I was glad to have had our pushchair. The lobby is vast and full of people, far too busy you didn't know who were tourists and who were residents. Once checked in we made our way to our room on the 18th floor overlooking the Marina Bay Gardens which was fabulous. The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom had a separate bath and shower the bath in particular was luxuriously big.

Our room had the most spectacular views it has to be said, but it felt tired. I just feel the hotel needs a makeover to bring it into the 2019 era and to match the asking price. But, I guess for most people it’s a chance to ‘check’ themselves in on social media and keep up with the jones’.",3,Neutral

624,"This is a 5-star hotel, but we found the property just couldn't handle crowds. There were multiple choke points around the property, most noticeably at the elevators, where you'd sometimes wait for multiple full elevators to go by. Or, wait times in general and massive cattle herding. For the price, this was a let down.  The room was fantastic, however we found little annoyances - the TV remote did not work, the window shade motor bugged out every time we activated the room power, and the mandarins they gave us has big mold spots. So, not perfect.  The Club 55 staff are superb - so personable. Shout out to Gina!",4,Neutral
625,We came here for one night and I must say it was a great disappointment for the amount of money we spent.   The hotel is a great looking iconic feature of Singapore and it has the world famous rooftop infinity pool. That’s where it ends.   Negatives:  1.The lobby is like a market place - noisy and crowded. There is nowhere to sit and relax eg while waiting for someone.   2.The check in and check out is atrocious- service is absolutely slow and understaffed. For a hotel of this reputation and standard I do not expect to be standing in line to check in for over 20 minutes.   3. The room is a standard size hotel room and is nothing special. For the cheapest room here we paid over £360 for 1 night! We have stayed in much better hotels in Singapore for a lot less than half that!   4.…,2,Negative

The rooftop pool has a brilliant city view - it's a bit of a selfie-soup, so don't expect to actually be able to swim properly, but the view is stunning. The poolside restaurant did amazing breakfasts and good cocktails (we didn't try any of the other food there).  Everything is ridiculously well organised and particularly liked that when you check out you can use the gym, spa and shower all day, so if you have an evening flight can leave your bags, enjoy the day then come and freshen up.   Singapore in general was a bit of a surprise. We saw it as a stopover and I'd always imagined it to be a bit…",5,Positive

Love the grand club room, plus the high tea, the cocktails and breakfast at club 55. (Will do a separate review at club 55).  The hotel as usual is crowded at the lobby, specially the check in and out counter hope they can do something about this. Good thing club rooms can check in at VIP check in counter.  Hope MBS will continue to have great service and amenities specially the infinity pool.  Will definitely visit MBS when I will be in SG again.  ",4,Positive

We stayed 2 nights and enjoyed everything, especially the infinity pool on the 57th which can only be accessed by guests. It is very busy and we were there for Chinese New Year and it was crowded. Our room 805 in the 3rd Tower was large and very well appointed. Access to the Gardens By The Bay, the shopping mall and the Art/Science Museum was easy. Service everywhere was excellent, cheerful staff were happy to help with everything thing.

I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands,  We had a package which allowed us private check-in. This alone, made it worth it after a 15 or 16 hour flight. . We had our choice of breakfast at 3 or 4 different places - we tried a different one every day.  We also had exclusive access to a Club room which we utilized a few times, but not every day.

The terrace area with bars, restaurants and the pool is amazing. Saying all that, we were disappointed with the lack of assistance from staff. They are just way too busy to be of help. We tried to get into the Ce La Vi club on the upper level and was told that tickets were sold out. The doorman was extremely rude! We chose to go elsewhere and found out on the ground floor that tickets were being sold for the club entry!",3,Neutral

If you are going to lay down $650 US for a room here be prepared for a sub standard experience. Room are nice but small for the $. Yes the pool is great and the view 5 star, its the screaming kids and parents that spoil the show. And the selfie gang, don’t get me started. So if we had to do over, spend a couple of hundred less on different 5 star hotel, or if your determined to spend the $650 per night, you can rent a whole sweet at say the inter continental hotel and get the service that should come with that price point.

The staff definitely seemed aware of this though and we were taken through to the VIP check-in to speed things along. As check in isn't until 3pm we were told our room wasn't ready but we were given temporary key cards to be able to access the pool area and we told we would be emailed when our room was ready.

The missing star is because is SO BIG, SO CROWDED that you feel as if you're in a theme park in Orlando, Fl. The swimming pool is nice during sunset, amazing view. The cocktail bar on top was so fun.

IMO, if a person pays extra $$ to get 2x nicer rooms for 5 star luxury (as promised), then maybe the hotel should invest in training their staff to provide 5 star customer service or at least teach them reasonable dispute resolution skills. Upon check-in (with a family of 5 AND 2 elderly grand parents) we were advised that our 2x booked rooms could not be adjoined and that only one room was available to us, forcing a 2 hr wait for the 2nd room to open up.

The infinity pool was as spectacular as we had imagined, the service at this hotel was prompt and excellent! I would definitely stay here again!

A beautiful way to spend the afternoon overlooking the Singapore skyline and enjoying the amenities and blissfulness of the pool area. The main criticism is the menu in the pool area needs a lot of improvement, and while you expect a place like this to be overpriced, the prices really were over the top for what you get, and the service was below average.

Staff is friendly, as you would expect from a hotel of this caliber.  The check-in process took a bit of time as there was a long queue, they made up for it by upgrading our room for free and allowing us to check in early.

There's no doubt it's an expensive hotel, with a lot of hype and recognition - much like the Burj Khalifa or Eiffel Tower. The views are unmatched.  I've read a couple of lackluster reviews of Club 55 (club lounge available to those who buy club level rooms), but I liked it. The food is NOT amazing, however the service and views make it a great place to visit. It can be crowded, but there are tables with views of either downtown/north or the harbor and gardens to the south. It's only two stories below the infinity pool. I think it's worth getting a club room, which includes breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening canapes.  Our room was on the 10th floor of…",5,Positive
677,"Once in a lifetime for me; I'm told the 2500 rooms are always full; amazing at the price point!  It is amazing; we were whisked into a VIP line upon entry; uncertain why but happy!  The room with a view of the bay was very clean and well furnished.  My only complaint is that we had been away from home for 3 weeks with lots of luggage.  The furniture doesn't have space to accommodate much clothing.  Be ready for expensive everything.  A glass of wine starts at $25 Singapore dollars and a Singapore sling is $35; meals follow suit.  You can, however, eat in the attached food court.  Don't be horrified!  The food is better than many restaurants in the US.  You can get a bowl of pho for $7. Service is impeccable. The lobby and the pool are very crowded.  At the pool, go to the adult…",5,Positive
678,"Hotel is very near to airport, approx 15 mins by Taxi, so great location to explore city. Lots of communal areas with shops and a Casino, plus a SkyPark (aka SkyDeck), but we found these and the lobby areas nearly always crowded, with hardly anywhere to sit, so if you are looking for a 5 star hotel with relaxing, quite public areas this one is not recommended. Had to queue for check-in and no welcome drink but room was comfortable (nothing special, more like 4 Star) and spacious, but on sixth floor, opposite the highway, so if you book this floor be prepared for some background road noise. AC a little noisy, but kept room cool. House-keeping excellent and kept room spotless. Room Key-cards can be temperamental so keep away from your mobile phone in pocket or handbag, unless you…",4,Positive

We will definitely be back, my advice is stay here if you can, it is pricey but we loved every minute. ",5,Positive

681,"Went to Singapore for an overnight trip from Bali. I had only dreamed of visiting this place after watching the Amazing Hotels series on Netflix! It was more amazing than I could have ever dreamed! I split the room with a friend, and we were in awe at our Harbour View room overlooking the Gardens by the Bay! We were on the 46th floor in the 3rd tower, and paid additional money for a higher floor. The breakfast at the RISE restaurant was spectacular - with an amazing buffet spread. The laser light show (we watched from right outside the mall entrance near the Louis Vuitton on it's own island) was AMAZING - one of the best that I have ever seen! And the pool.... oh the pool! I went up with one set of friends in the evening, and then again in the morning with another set of…",5,Positive
682,"We paid a bit extra for a room high up facing the city. The view was stunning. The rest was not cheap for what it was, but it was memorable. Walking through the lobby was kinda like going to the British Museum, it's just too huge. You don't feel special, you are just a tourist among many hundred other tourists who are posing in the pool, which makes you feel a bit silly perhaps. Still, we had a couple hundred photos of ourselves in the pool to show for it & everyone did love the photos. So I suppose as a one-off it was alright",4,Neutral
683,Amazing views and facilities. 15 min from the airport and all the city under you to enjoy it. It is the best hotel I have been in so far. Infinity pool is open from 6:00am up to 23:00pm and it is big enough to avoid massification. Nice one!,5,Neutral
684,We had a great time at MBS and its our first time in Singapore. They made sure that we had the best time and offered the best assistance. Our room was very clean and organized.

685,"On our tour of 5 top Singapore hotels, the MBS is an iconic building with unparalleled views. Unfortunately this monster of a hotel is disappointing on service by its very size. Service is impersonal, rushed and inefficient. Club 55 is like a cheap airport lounge with bland food. Queues for restaurants are not uncommon with mediocre food.  Room decor is utilitarian.  You’re simply paying for staying in an iconic hotel!",4,Neutral

We got the free room upgrade from garden view to city view with 2 king beds plus early check-in! Winning!!! The room was just perfect. Very spacious, luxurious, clean, comfortable. And the views from the room are just magnificent. We watched the Spectra light & water show from the comfort of our room! And the infinity pool ... this is the main reason we stayed there ... the kids loved it we made sure we utilised it on both days. Such a memorable experience for my family.",5,Positive

On arrival there was a huge queue for the reception check in desks.   Not for club rooms, go straight in to the lounge, have a coffee then all done.   Every morning, huge queues for breakfast.  Not for club rooms, go straight to complementary breakfast on the 55th floor.   Free cocktails and canapes each day too (plus afternoon tea which we didnt try).   Canapes are substantial and drinks keep coming...   Maybe almost enough for dinner.  So the room - well it is clean and tidy and huge.  The downsides.   Well first of all in the bathroom the shower room is huge but rather than fit a rainfall shower it is a…",4,Positive

Only thing was, weather wasn't great (raining), I missed the evening time in the pool. So, went to pool early in the morning and there was no crowd but it was lil windy and cold.   If you stay in upper floors you get a nice view and water show (for the city view) in the night and I am glad that I upgraded my room to upper floors.

We paid approx A$800 for one room for one night which is top dollar high end .   It was not worth the price or the effort - the hotel is in my view overly populated and not relaxing. The pool itself is cold and we believe this is deliberate to keep customers from spending too long there . Most patrons take their glamorous selfies in the pool then leave . Tick , been there , done that . I can’t think of a reason to go back but it has extinguished our curiosity . I think the pool is over rated .

Visited Club 55 on every stay and I couldn't get sick of the free-flow alcohol and food from 5 to 7pm. Not the best ambience but the food and drinks made up for it. I do wish that they extent the cocktails evening to 8pm but considering they are turning over for hotel guest that are paying for their drinks, I can't say much.

The lobby is terribly crowded with bus tours of people wanting to see the ""iconic"" hotel and you have to fight your way thru the crowds to get to your elevator.    Service was sub par.  The hotel pool is not that amazing- think 2561 rooms in the hotel and this many guests trying to use a very small pool and take selfies at the pools edge. This is not a pool to relax at.   You can never find a chair and the lounge chairs are on top of each other.  Water pressure in our room was very low and one day we had not hot water due to a mechanical breakdown.

This hotel is so ultramodern, even the curtains open and close at the touch of a button. At night the hotel with its three towers and the SkyPark on top looks like a kind of starship... The SkyPark itself is a unique experience; the infinity pool seems to dissolve into the city skyline and you feel as though you’re almost flying over Singapore when you’re in it. My room was very spacious and comfortable and every amenity was there. And the staff were superlatively helpful. My recommendation: Splurge on a night’s stay here; you’ll always remember it!",5,Positive

The front reception area is exhausting because it can get quite busy and there is no welcoming place to sit .

We would go back to the pool at 10am and there was the culprit with his friends arriving at the same time as us and they all just took up the pool seats he had saved 4 hours earlier.

Enjoyed the breakfast in the room, and thankful for the slice of birthday cake surprise. Also check in could improve as we had to wait almost 40 minutes in the long que which took the toll. otherwise overall a great experience and may consider to come back if we have done with the rest of the…",4,Neutral

740,"My boyfriend booked this hotel as a surprise for me for our time in Singapore. It was the best surprise ever, I’ve always wanted to stay here. It did not disappoint, the room was beautiful, very clean and modern. Loved the balcony, we had a view facing the gardens. We watched the light show of the trees from our room. The infinity pool was insane, we had the pool to ourselves at sunset for a short time, the weather was so bad before and we waited (the only people left waiting) so got it to ourselves. The best experience ever. Thank you for such an amazing time here. We will be back! ",5,Positive
741,"This place lives up to all the expectations you’d expect from just a prominent place.  It was our first visit and we booked ourselves in for just 1 night of our visit as a treat. They always try and upgrade people visiting for the first time so we got a super high up room facing the city. The views were amazing.   The room itself was nice and spacious and everything you’d need.  And obviously the iconic sky pools are awesome. It’s a breathtaking place to go, we were busy in the evening so didn’t watch sunset but instead got up super early for sunrise. It’s harder to watch sunrise just because of the layout but it rained anyway so sadly we did t really see much.  The gardens side is a pretty awesome outlook, would definitely pick that side if we went back.   We also enjoyed one…",5,Positive
742,"Quick check-in even in the festive season, efficient lead time to process requests and spacious rooms. These things do mark for a five star rating but what else for if one pays $799 for one night. Lesser options for vegans if one opts for spago for breakfast. Sometimes staff doesn't even bother to pay an ear and just keep on repeating that they value customers and would do anything to extend help, but once you try to put your requests, they interrupt with the same speech all over. (We requested an extension for one hour to check the sky park deck. Our access keys stopped working at 11:45 AM although we still had 15 minutes left. We kept on requesting the reception team and they did honor our request too but like after half an hour. We made sure that the room was checked out at…",3,Neutral
743,"We have had a fantastic time as we enjoyed a spacious suite with all comfort you can dream of, on the 51st floor with marina view! The rim pool is just out of this world. The breakfast is a huge buffet and provides the right option for each and everybody. Prices are not cheap  but the 10,000 people working in this Hotel with over 2,000 beds need to earn a living! We will definitely be back.",5,Positive
744,This was our second stay at Marina Bay. Spent two nights on the way home from Europe. Didn’t leave the hotel the whole stay as there is no need to. Stayed in grand club room which was fantastic. Great food and drinks included at Club55. Amazing pool not too crowded. Will be back. ,5,Positive
745,What a great way to see Singapore from above...absolutely stunning! The views are spectacular and don't miss the opportunity to have a glass of wine while enjoying the view. Unless you stay at the hotel unfortunately you can't enjoy a dip in the pool...but still worth a visit.,5,Positive
746,"Sadly this hotel was too big to offer a personal service . We booked two rooms . One was fine with lovely views , unfortunately the second one was not ! It was too noisy from the road outside the window . When we informed the check in clerk of this the only solution offered was to up grade to a larger room . Our son didn’t want a larger room , just a room he could sleep in !   We explained that the minimum a room should provide was the ability to sleep , this was ignored by the staff and they just kept repeating that an up grade charged at £30 a night extra was the only course to take !!!!!  We paid this as it was apparent that we were not going to be offered any other remedy .   The pool area was too crowded also . I would recommend booking elsewhere in Singapore.",2,Negative

We booked Premium room wgich is bigger than the Lux room- the room is big enough for our family, good quality, the bathroom is also perfect with bath and shower. If you take a room with Gardens by the bay you have a balcony( I think that other side rooms- City view- dont have  balconies). We love that because we can watch from our balcony light show in the evening in gardens. The swimmingpool is open till 11 p.m. and it is real great and this is the reason most guests stay there. It is on 57 floor and the staff check if you are a hotel guest to use a pool. And I think it is ok- without it everybody…",5,Positive
748,I would give the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room 5/5 stars but because there is really nothing much to do here except for shopping which I hate most.

If only they could regular the water temperature and the amount of people stoning around spending hours just taking selfies.,3,Neutral

Straight to the pool, was not as busy as anticipated having read the reviews. No problem getting sun lounger and the perfect picture. The whole site is amazing, the shoppes, the casino, watching the marina light show from our hotel room I will never forget it. Can’t wait to return already. So sad to be leaving.

After seeing the hotel ‘lowest pricing guarantee’ heavily advertised all throughout their website and How be guaranteed that their prices are so low, but if you are able to find a lower price, they will match the price and also give you a room upgrade. All of these promises invoked me to book my stay directly with them without looking at other websites.   I read over the terms and conditions to ensure I understood how their policy worked.   Feeling Pretty confident about my booking,  I then advised my partner about our booking and the Price  guarantee so naturally, he took this as a challenge and decided to go online and see if there were any  websites that were offering the same room for a lower price.

So if you’re looking for a small luxury boutique hotel, which I normally do, this is not it.

The views from our room on the 51st floor are jaw-dropping. It was quite an interesting place to people watch with folks running around in bathrobes and evening gowns at night.

753,Obviously the hotel is glamorous- I saw the show on Netflix and decided to book it at $650 USD a night! Clearly it’s ambitious and views are absolutely stunning. Food is wonderful and the staff is absolutely courteous.  However it’s a FISH MARKET with 1000s of people bumping into you. Endless lines for everything from room service to checkin.   Swimming pool is overcrowded and pathetic with people just standing taking endless pictures all day. No one is swimming. I just didn’t like the crowd this hotel attracts. It’s more of a tourist spot for people to say they visited than a luxury hotel. I didn’t feel luxurious period.  Never visiting again  ,1,Negative
754,"Quite likely the best hotel I've stayed in, in all my life. Everything is absolutely perfect. It faces The Gardens and is adjacent to a massive mall and food court. Cant wait to go back! The three towers are massive, so if you are a group try and stay in the same one as it takes time to get from one to the other. Also the infamous infinity pool is a must!",5,Positive

Seriously, form the moment you walk in, to check out, the staff are so helpful, the hotel is so clean and its just amazing to be there after seeing it online and on TV.  The lobby is huge and reminded me of hotels in Vegas, very big and grand. The staff are very helpful and offered us to upgrade our room for a charge, we said no because only staying for two nights. When we got to our room, it was huge! Big bed, separate lounger, chair and desk and a balcony over looking the gardens by the bay. What a view! The bathroom was also big and very clean. The best part is of course the swimming pool on the top floor. WOW! Clean, very big and lots of space for families with a separate area for adults…",5,Positive
759,"As fairly regular travellers to Singapore, my husband and I had promised ourselves we'd stay here at some point. We stayed for 3 nights in a club room. As a club guest on first arrival you are shown into a private check in room. However, this is not like any other club check in I have experienced. Guests take a ticket and sit in a fairly soulless waiting room that reminded me of an airline lounge. There was no guest greeting, no cold/hot towels, no served drinks, or other special touches. Just sit and wait then go to a desk to check in.  The bedroom was spacious and light but it really was nothing special. The decor was bland and the light wood used looked cheap. The hotel had the opportunity to build in some features such as an open plan bathroom or windows on to the bathroom…",4,Neutral
760,"We stayed at MBS last year for just the one day after a cruise and before going home.  We enjoyed that stay so much, that this year we returned and stayed longer (3 days).  The foyer is dauntingly huge, and is more like a railway station than a hotel.  However, check in was efficient, and once you are given your room, all is good!  We stayed in a Premier room, on the 8th floor in Tower 2, which is on the lower end of the $ scale.  It's still excellent.  The room is very large, with a very nice bathroom.  The service is prompt which is incredible for such a large hotel.  The location is a bit out of the centre of town, but with the MRT station directly below the hotel, and a shopping centre next door, it's very convenient. Yeah, it's pricey, but Singapore is an expensive place,…",5,Positive

Infinity pool was fab but again packed and couldn't get a bed, even at seven in morning, breakfast on the roof was really nice although again if you arrived after seven had to queue. Light show was an experience and well worth watching. All in all a great experience as a one off put very expensive as everything seems to have tax and service charge added to the price and it all appears a bit cold and surreal. ",4,Positive

Over the years I have booked 100s of rooms and in most cases pre paid for them but never have I come across anything as difficult as this one. It’s not a process for Mr average in fact if you have a degree in IT you should be ok. Just looking forward to my night there as I am really excited at stopping there. I will post a new review after our stay but sorry Marina Bay Sands Hotel I cannot recommend you booking and paying system.,2,Negative

Excellent breakfast, you can choose from three different restaurants that serve both European as well as Asian breakfast style, all very delicious, one of them being on the root top. There was a smaller queue, so you had to wait to be seated. Excellent views over the city. The hotel is well situated, with easy access to the metro to visit the city. Enough opportunities to be entertained, in the evening there is a great laser show, there is a theatre, museum and lots of shops.

Although it’s pricey we paid £350 for a night with breakfast and family room, it was worth it. The roof top pool is just amazing, in the day and especially at night.(get a selfy stick) The room was huge with a spectacular city view. The buffet breakfast in the roof top restaurant was delicious, I wish I could have ate more. In the ground floor there is an escalator that takes you down to a huge shopping centre with high end shops and loads of eateries. On the other side there is a bridge that takes you across the road to Gardens by the Bay, which is well worth a walk around. On the whole we had a great stay and can’t wait to come back next year,…",5,Positive
765,"It was a bucket list stay of three nights with the token picture in the infinity pool. However, for the price we believe there are better places to stay such as the Pan Pacific. The view from our room was amazing and the room itself large and comfortable but you pay for it. The pool was crowded and if you wanted to be near the pool you needed to be there at 8.30 in the morning or after 7 at night. It was also incredibly expensive to eat with breakfast at $53.00 (SG) each, however because of a fabulous location there is access to many great areas outside the hotel. Absolutely glad we did it but will not be returning ",4,Positive

Misogyny abounds, from the fact that the photographers in the pool avoid you as if you were invisible, to the inspection you will get at the casino.  The Asian mentality is still decades behind and a woman traveling alone is not ok yet . It’s sad but true . This place is grand and beautiful but the turnover is so huge- occupancy is 95%!! That they really don’t care- there is no hair dryer, no scale in the room, breakfast is a whopping 60$ and a tip of 10% is automatically added on everything.

The view from the pool is indeed a treat. However, that’s where the positives end. It is otherwise like every other ‘beige’ international tourist hotel. It is over priced & we found it somewhat vulgar. The lovely pool has become what should be designated ‘competition for the best ‘selfie’ zone’. The hotel is enormous leaving it soulless. It is a ‘tourist sight’ of itself with tour groups frequenting the foyer. Overall it lacked all charm & left us feeling like we were on a giant narcissistic cruise ship!",2,Neutral

Check in took a very, very long time but it was because the staff spent so long with each person to review things thoroughly.  Pool was really incredible- not to be missed!!

They also offer an afternoon tea a special thank you to 4 people who made our time the best Olga, Vinson, Ralph and Aires! The service provided was exceptional. The pool area has deck chair service cocktails work out about £15 but they add 10%. It was all very clean as expected in Singapore.

Very clean, tidy and well equipped rooms, although the interiors are not what makes this hotel spectacular. ",4,Positive
802,"Stood 2 nights at Marina Bay Sands on my stopover in Singapore before flying back to Brussels.  This is a major Las Vegas factory: 2600 rooms, 3 towers, 57 floors, the highest infinity pool of the world, a huge mall, a casino, 50+ restaurants... My full respect -- I appreciate the complexity of keeping such a machinery up and running.  Room size OK, bathroom OK.  The famous infinity pool: hopelesly overcrowded: imagine a public pool in a big town. Only chance to get a chair by the water: at 6am when it opens, or just after sunset (7:30pm) and before 9pm, when it gets overcrowded again (it closes at 11pm).  The breakfast experience: disgusting. There are 3 restaurants serving breakfast to the armada of guests. Simply not suficient. It is utterly unacceptable to make you queue…",3,Neutral

One thing i have to mentioned that the crowed was too much considering the size of the pool.

Better choose other 5* in the city. 30 minutes is the minimum que for breakfast , 45 min to baggage delivery by Concierge, 45 min to in room dining , 10-15 min for checkin over counter as per Mr Michael who check in me at Tower 3 lobby. He abruptly said that he needs 10 min to check in one room. So in that ratio he said you have total 10 room needs 100 min. This is what this hotel have these kind of management n staff to hire.

I had booked a club room and if you have the coin to do it, I think it’s the way to go. It costs a bit more, but you get breakfast, afternoon tea and early evening drinks.  The room was huge. The bed was comfy, there were lots of channels on the tv, the view out the window was awesome ( I was directly opposite the laser light show that happened twice nightly). The bathroom was ornate without being overly flashy, but was also about half the size of my house at home, it was big enough to hold a small polo match!

810,We stayed one night at Marina Bay Sands during our vacation in Singapore to mark this iconic hotel of our bucket list. This is a huge hotel with 2500 rooms and feels at times a bit crowded. Luckily we had access to the Lounge Club 55 and avoided the biggest crowds. The infinity pool is amazing an the service was excellent as one should expect from a 5-star hotel.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the rudeness of the main waiter in C’est La Vie annoyed me considerably and I did complain to management. However, he was the only exception to otherwise magnificent service.  I want to highlight the fantastic service in Renku. We called in for a drink and found a regular place to complete each day. The food served was of the highest quality, the touches of originality in both taste and presentation surprised us.

My wife and I were really excited to stay there and had a vision of hanging out at the worlds largest and highest infinity pool in the world. Those plans were dashed the first day when we went up to the top and realized it was an absolute zoo. There were so many people up there that you could hardly find a place to sit. The view is amazing but all the tourist kind of ruin the experience.  We stayed 4 nights, the cost was over $2400 with two of those nights being in a suite on the 54th floor.

Thats the one star. Feeling of living there is hectic, noisy and casino mentality. So, it's a stressful environment. But for one night to experience it is ok... Now...They squeeze out as much money as possible. Prices are ridiculous for what you get. I did not mind the high price per room as it was winter break, even if the rooms don't live up to the standard of the price BUT when they cheat on small things that add up extra expenses for a family on top of extreme pricing from the beginning, on top of the service you already paid for, then we give this hotel a MINUS!

After staying at Hotel Jen and using their rooftop pool, MBS was not even close to as good. the MBS check in experience was great - busy but we had a sky view deluxe room so were checked via a separate VIP area. The room was massive and the view was great (47th floor). The fittings and finish were a bit worn for such an amazing building. Even the hallway and elevators showed lots of wear (and its a relatively new hotel).

The sunrise is an amazing experience, I highly recommend to get in early to catch the glimpse. You can view the whole Marina Bay from here.  The pool is an experience, though the water can be a bit cold in the morning. The city view is something you want to post on your insta.

818,"i stayed here for 2 nights (with additional 2 nights at Parkroyal on Pickering for more relaxing time). i was glad to try out the full Marina Bay experience -- and of course the pool. However, this place is just too big to feel like a luxury hotel. Much of the time it feels more like being in transit in an airport. For example, when i checked out at 11am it took literally 35 minutes to get my family and luggage down in the lifts, which were jammed full of other departing guests. The pool is similarly packed. It's virtually impossible to get a poolside seat, or even to swim amidst the crowds standing in the water with selfie-sticks.  it's unique, spectacular and worth doing (briefly) but more of an amusement park vibe...",3,Neutral

We appreciated the checkin clerk upgrading our room for free.   The mall and restaurant are all high end and high prices but beautiful in their own right. We enjoyed walking through them.

821,"Curiosity finally got the better of me, and I stayed at MBS mainly to experience a swim in the rooftop pool.  Non-guests are not permitted, and it's just as well because the pool can be quite congested even without them.  The pool is great of course, very long but not as wide as I had imagined.  If you're staying any length of time at the pool you will of course need to eat and drink.  The prices are a bit of a shock, made worse because they are all ""++"" prices - I hate that.  But just because you are paying an explicit ""Service Charge"", don't worry, you will still be presented with space on the bill to add a Tip.

The view from our room was no less spectacular and the service we received from check in, to room service was outstanding.   The rooms weren’t luxurious but excellent quality all round and breakfast in Club55 was one of the best we have had in any hotel, indeed Club55 was something that really made our stay.

Inside is quite underwhelming and lacks the WOW factor. Having the check-ins in basically what is a shopping mall is very tacky and having public toilets next to those check-ins is even worse. Along with tourists like myself the whole area was a mass of people shopping or checking in or out...it really is disappointing from the inside. The shops within the complex are the same as you will see in every major shopping centre in Singapore with all the big name (and overpriced) brands occupying space...strangely not many had customers in them",3,Neutral

Do take note timing to swim as the water is cold (better to swim in a sunny afternoon) for people who drive, they provide a valet service at tower 1 with a charge of $12sgd before tax for 24 hours parking and and unlimited entry during the time Slot. Overall a great experience. ",5,Positive
859,"When you talk about a really perfect hotel with all the amenities and facilities that luxury and normal tourists are searching for,the only hotel comes to my mind is Marina bay sands.This hotel is a huge hotel just like a city.",5,Positive
860,Visited this iconic hotel as part of an excursion. Walked through the absolutely massive lobby between the two towers and into the lift and up to the 56th floor. The viewing deck is shaped like a boat and has a 360 degree view of the Singapore skyline. Breathtaking views.,5,Positive
861,I came here with 2 days then 3 booked in December.  Our adjoining room wasn't ready for us after we arrived at 3. If you want to pay a lot. We had to spend 1hr20 checking in and out both times. The service is really slow for the money.,1,Negative
862,"I stayed there about 5 years ago when the pool was just opened and I thought ""I need my family to stay here with me in the future"".   We went to Singapore for my son's birthday a couple of weeks ago and convinced my husband to stay there again... but it turns out nothing has changed. You can see the pool starting to peel, some of the tiles missing, rooms a bit dated, just painted on top of stains, and it was a bit disapointing, it's like no money has been spent to keep it going, just appearances. Also, too many people in the pool, which has made it to be not as exclusive as it used to be.   View was still amazing and we stayed in the pool as much as we could but also the water was freezing and I got laryngitis so was definitely not the best experience that I was looking for when…",3,Neutral
863,We stayed for 6 nights in a suite with our 2 small children. This whole trip stay was a. disaster. If you are stressed upon arrival you can be sure you will wish that you only were at that stress level upon departure ! And when you are relaxed upon arrival you will 100% stressed upon departure. The whole stay you will feel like in a busy airport terminal. The hotel let’s everybody in !! Guest or no guests !! So you have to constantly make your way through hundreds of people ... the elevators are only for guests but again be ready to be in packed elevators stopping at 10 floors before you arrive on your floor... this while being stuffed  tgth with guests with wet towels coming down or going to the most ridiculous pool in the world . I must agree the idea of having a pool on top…,1,Negative

866,"My first day here. View of Straits of Malacca / The Garden. Spectacular .... BUT this is Just another high priced casino / theme hotel, just like in Vegas. Vegas has a vibrant sexy energy, not this one.   The infinity pool depth is highly disappointing - only about 4 feet. It is FILTHY. Disgusting. Not going back into it.   Too much hype for nothing. Over crowded. Tons of garbage floating at the edge of the pool. While you are trying to enjoy the view, these garbages make it very unappetizing.  Don’t waste your money, unless if you wanna entertain your kid for a night.  There are so many hotels in Singapore, alot less than what you pay for this Bay Sands. Have better pools and restaurants ( again over priced).   Not elegant at all. Noisy kids. Dang!! I regret booking for 2…",2,Negative
867,"Yes the pool is amazing and that's it. The overall staff is rude, especially the ones at the pool side, asking a cocktail becomes like a fight. I booked 2 adults and 2 children, I paid extra for an upgraded room at checkin, and 5 hours later I had to fight an hour over phone to get an extra bed for children. I've been told that we can sleep all 4 in the same bed (M.Navin told me that)!  As a bonus the morning you have to wait 15 minutes before getting a table for the breakfast. My advice: book a single night to experience the pool and then book another hotel for the remaining of your SG journey.",1,Neutral
868,"We stayed for 2 nights (xmas eve & xmas day). Room was clean with nice decor & spacious with plenty of drawer space. We had a garden view room& the view was breathtaking, especially at night. Infinity pool was beautiful but over crowded. You have to be at the pool early to get a good spot. It is nice photo opportunities. Buffet breakfast is nothing special. Spread was common as any other 4-5 star hotels. Skypark entry was free for guests which is nice. Plenty of places to eat at. The food court has heaps of variety & really nice food.",4,Positive
869,"I have stayed in 5 star hotels that were better, mostly for the staff and the food, but this was an excellent hotel.  The rooftop pool made the expense worthwhile and was a birthday treat to myself. It’s also a great location from which to explore the marina Bay Area.",4,Positive

The breakfast was beautiful and staff very good.  Pick up from the airport through the hotel and they were so helpful.   The hotel inside is very large, prices of wine vary largely between restaurants within the hotel   The pool is still the winner and everytime I visit Singapore I still find myself and the kids in the pool enjoying the views ",5,Positive
871,"This hotel is definitely worth a stay but if you are looking for 5 star service, this is not entirely the hotel for you. We stayed in tower 3.  Drop off and check in were straight forward, however if we wanted our bags delivered to our room that would have been a 20 minute wait! The room was a delux king on the 45th floor with a view of the Bay of Gardens. The rooms are spacious and the view was spectacular, especially at night. This was my 2nd stay here and last time I had a view of the marina and the Singapore skyline. Personally, I prefered the marina view but no real complaints either way.  The infinity pool is spectacular and if we had longer, we would have chilled out longer here. My travel companion had not stayed here, hence the 2nd visit. Why was I…",4,Positive

I got the compliments but I will review it without any related to the compliments as I member of Sand Rewards.   This time, It was peak. Holiday seasons. So crowded. You couldn’t expect much for any outstanding service such as how the concierge delivered your bags to room.   But let me note, that the hospitality service always outstanding even though the hotel was so crowded.   Overall.. I love this hotel.  Will be back after new year. ",5,Positive
873,"The hotel is a sightseeign, worth staying one night to use the pool, the gym and other amenities for guests only. The view is incredible specially if your room is sided to the Garden - Bay. Everything is expensive so plan accordingly",5,Positive
874,An awesome place to see whole Singapore with fish eye view. You need to buy tickets from basement. It would cost you around $30-$40 SGD. They will take to the terrace from where you can see whole beautiful Singapore. Take beer & sit on floor & watch the view. And obviously beer is not free. No time limits. Good place to take selfie as well. Staffs are very cooperative & friendly.,4,Positive
875,"Stayed in this super cool hotel for 2 nights, on 11 floor. There is a beautiful pool on top for just in-house guests. It has amazing outlook, especially at night full of neon lights, a part of a whole complex: Shoppes, gardens by the bay, Merlion statue, Sentosa park... But my staying, not that fair, just so noisy from my room, didn’t sleep enough.",3,Positive
876,This is a huge hotel.The views and the staff would get a five stars. I enjoyed looking down on the city from all direction. Wonderful. I was not keen on the crowds of people around the roof pool. It’s all about the perfect selfie and people take them constantly.It was actually very comical but it is one of the most famous iconic places in Singapore so of course it’s to be expected. The rooms were spotless and very quiet. I would not expect anything less from a hotel of this category. I wasn’t blown away. Sorry to be fussy but the toilet seat was not soft closing:-),4,Neutral
877,"A Christmas Staycation at the MBS Front desk was great and we got a 49th floor, deluxe room with City View. Room was huge but a bit too empty, would be great if there are more decor. Amenities in the rooms are minimum, quite disappointed but room is clean. Automatic window blind was quite noisy and lack maintenance. For a 5 star hotel, I do expect more especially it cost almost $1000 for a night. Not worth the money.   #marinabaysands #hotel #staycation #mbs #deluxeroom #cityview #christmas #holiday #sg #accomodation #review #travel #singapore ",3,Neutral

879,"We only stayed in Marina Bay Sands for 1 night, but it was the best night I had in Singapore. There was so much space, huge bathtub and shower. The infinity pool was beautiful and it was definitely worth the money also the view was breathtaking. The area was great and right in front of the light show. I wish I could rate rate it a 1000,000,00,000,000,000,000,000 stars. Very very very highly reccomended. ",5,Positive
880,"So when you go to check in, they tell you that you have to wait for a few hours and they will e-mail you. When we signed the paper, we notified the receptionist that he wrote the e-mail address wrong and he said that he will change it. Hours later we were still waiting for an e-mail, which never came. I went to ask the front desk if there's any way we can at least pay for an earlier check in as we were exhausted. She told me the room is ready and the bags are already there. So make sure they write your e-mail correctly. After the shower we went upstairs for the infinity pool, but you only find out that you need both keys when you arrive there so if u left ur other key in the room, you have to make another trip back. Breakfast is ok, nothing out of the ordinary. Amazing view of…",3,Negative

Loved window shopping-Gucci, Prada out of my budget.  Singapore does Christmas beautifully.  City feel safe & is very clean. ",5,Positive
882,"Of course it's a 5-star property, great location, great service etc etc. But to be honest the ONLY reason I stayed was for the infinity pool access, once I had my fill I switched to Sheraton which I felt was better located in terms of walkability/access to Clarke Quay and LauPaSat. No doubt great luxurious facility and amazing service though!",5,Positive
883,We stayed here as the hotel is iconic and we wanted to experience the roof top pool ( quite surreal ) The rooms were spacious and we had a great view over Gardens by the Bay. It was a bonus to find a generous sized balcony. The whole complex is massive and we got lost frequently. The lift system is complicated given that the hotel is comprised of 2 towers. The evening light show is spectacular,4,Neutral

885,"The room is spacious and with full bay wall glass. One can see the Bay Garden, the Spectra Light show and walk to Casino, Food Court and taxi to every attraction less than $10 Singapore.   The sky infinity pool is best fun for couple and family alike. Plenty of chairs and towels never seem hard to find.  Its little awark to switch elevator at level 34 to reach the pool  at level 57 and then go to Tower 2 down to level 55 for fitness center, sauna and steam room.  It does not offer shuttle to and from cruise terminal or air ports. They order taxi service for guests.  Taxi either give you fixed price in advanced or use meter but very reasonable.  We did not buy breafast but breakfast lines were long suggesting they were good.  Its wifi is good at food court as well.",5,Positive

887,"We stayed with friends for 2 nights, booked a city and a garden view room so had drinks in one the first night and the other the second - best of both worlds.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable, bed very comfortable. Beware of the mini bar - it is computerised so as soon as you take something out it registers and charges you - not sure what the time scale is but our friends took everything out to cool water and had to go to customer services to get it put right. The foyer is very busy.  Gardens by the bay are easily accessible.  Expensive but a great experience.  Splash out and make sure you are high enough to make the most of the views.",5,Positive
888,"Marina Bay Sands (MBS) - supposedly the best in S'pore or perhaps in the region. But for those who have experienced true 5-star service will know MBS is just an iconic showpiece offering a skypark and infinity pool with a view. But the hotel is overpriced (even in S'pore standards) and there are many better hotels in Orchard and Marina Bay area that offer 5-star service and creature comforts for more value-for money.  Many things failed to impress me at MBS let me highlight a few, the list can go on:-  1. Service staff don't bother to smile or greet the guests - everyone is so busy, preoccupied with their work that they forget that their primary job is to serve the guests. The servers at the Rise buffet restaurant look overworked, tired to serve the guests. They don't look happy…",2,Negative
889,"Having a daughter at school in Singapore meant we have been frequent visitors  for several years but have always stayed at the St Regis- which is faultless. However we thought this time we would try somewhere different as my daughter had some friends staying at the same time.  The Marina Bay is a lovely hotel and we had a beautiful room-a Grand Suite with the club. It was however situated looking over Gardens by the Bay on a very busy road and so the doors could not be opened due to noise. While the downstairs is full of tourists, the private areas are quiet with the exception of the pool. If you ever wondered where all the selfie sticks went to retire, look there. Management should ban them in the pool as it’s a joke trying to avoid them. Club 55 is great with the afternoon…",3,Neutral

The hotel is big, very big, with such a huge inventory of rooms and events happening every now and then, lobby is very busy and buzzing. There are main reception on one side of the tower and then there is another reception on the 3rd Tower. The staff is ok, friendly. I checked and asked for room facing the city, whereas they provided me with much better room of garden by the bay facing.   When i entered the room it was not cleaned, i immediately called the housekeeping and got it corrected. The staff was quick to sort my problem, however, with MBS, I hoped not to face any problem.

Rooms were spotless and it was quite a treat getting to stay there.   The only flaw I had during my stay was with the service of one of the bell-hops we’d encountered in the elevator (as we were heading up), who was rather rude to me and my friends and cursed aloud in Mandarin thinking we wouldn’t understand what he’d said. We caught hold of a manager and filed a complaint, and the bell-hop was made to apologise to us following this. ",4,Positive

The infinity pool with its views across the city is amazing and we were surprised that there was so much space to get a bed at any time of the day. The service and choices of restaurants nearby especially at the “shoppes” in the mall is numerous. Check out the deals the hotel as with restaurants in the shopping centre as we got free deserts and 20% of our food bill. ,5,Positive

We enjoyed three nights at the Marina Bay Sands earlier this year, and our two sons, both under 10yo, are still talking about it!  Club Room - We paid extra for a Club Room so we'd have the extra space to accommodate a family of four.  Joanne very kindly ensured we had a room with two Queen beds, which was simply perfect. The room was spacious, very clean and modern, and not at all cramped with the four of us. It looked out behind the hotel towards the rest of the city, and twice every evening we got to enjoy a water fountain show on the water directly below/behind the room, set to music with lights.  We took advantage of the included afternoon tea at the Club Lounge, but…",5,Positive

At the Gardens, I saw this structure unlike anything I'd ever seen before.  I found out it was a hotel, and resolved, should I ever return to Singapore, to stay there. Opportunity arose and we booked a club room for a five night stay.  I could easily have doubled that if I could have afforded it.  Our room was on the 45th floor, overlooking the bay.  The view was stunning day and night, and not only could we see the Marina Bay light show from our room, in some ways, it was the best view of all (and we tried six different locations.) The room was VERY large with very comfortable king-sized bed and pillows.  Great roomy…",5,Positive

The negatives:  - Singapore is one of the most expensive places in the world. The hotel is on another level of expensive...  - the extra you pay for this hotel is for the infinity pool and nothing else.

901,It's always worth it to splurge for the infinity pool here. It is absolutely amazing. The hotel itself last time I was here I thought the room was ok.

We had afternoon tea and canapes at club 55 and this was great, the selection was enough to graze over. We had breakfast at Spago on the roof and the selection was great.   Overall we had a great time. I feel that you pay the extra due to it being Marina Bay Sands.

The rooms are very average, they don’t feel clean the pick and choose if it suits them for a 12 and 15 year old to be an adult, they upgrade you without asking to a city view room with 2 single beds, very well knowing you will need another bed, you ask the question and they reply sorry you will need a roll away bed which will cost $160 per night plus tax, well sorry that wasn’t happening the room cost enough as it was.

There was a light breeze up there, palm trees that one can find shade under, and also hot tubs.  During the day, it was quite busy in the pool.  Most people in the pool are taking selfies or group pictures at the edge of the infinity pool. The selfie stick is alive!

The difference for us though were the amazing staff. From check in, luggage handlers, room attendants and reception / wait staff.

The staff managed the steady flow of incoming and outgoing guests seamlessly....I honestly don’t know how they did it. Kudos to them!!  The room, once we entered was large but felt a bit dated; possibly because I’d just come from the Park Hyatt Bangkok where every detail was so well thought out and the architecture, impressive.

First, the check in staff was wonderful.  They made me feel immediately at home.  Very warm and personal.  Second, once you are in the towers, it is very quiet and does not feel like a Vegas style hotel.  Three, the room was so much better than the pictures.  Really great room.  Four, all staff throughout the resort are wonderful.  If I return to Singapore, I will definitely stay here again.  Convenient to the mall with many restaurants.  Great views of the Garden by the Bay and the ocean.  Ultra clean rooms, great service.  What a wonderful surprise.",5,Positive

My only niggle with the hotel is the lift set up. Tower 3 has two sets of lifts, we needed to transfer at level 34 to change lifts to reach the rooftop. This meant a wait on level 34 and usually very busy lifts, especially at peak times.  The rooftop was spectacular. The views were amazing. The pool was busy but not as crazy as others have described.  We ate at a number of the hotels restaurants and they were very good, especially Spago!

922,"Me and my wife stayed at this property in November this year. I must say, everything about this place is spectacular except the check in process which is time consuming. They hardly have two check-in counters with minimal staff. Considering the price you pay to stay at this property, the amount of time you spend to check-in itself is too much. We managed to check-in by 2.45 pm despite reaching there by 1.00 pm. The total number of rooms to the check in counter ratio is just not right ! I guess they should work on this because of the fact that most of the people come to stay for only one night to check the famous bucket list item ""The Infinity Pool"".",3,Neutral
923,"Firstly, Singapore is beautiful! We called in to Marina Bay Sands approx 10.30am to drop off our luggage so we could explore until check in. Once we approached the counter they said we were able to check in now! There were 3 of us so we had to wait for a rollaway bed (the rollaway bed was comfortable but took the elegance a way from the experience) while we were waiting we stood by the window by the elevator. The view of the city was amazing! We weren't even in the room yet and we were all so excited!  Once entering the room everything was amazing. The bathroom set up made you feel fabulous. The bed was comfortable. We had a view of the gardens and the harbour. Both Amazing during the day and night. Once settled we needed to go up to the pool.

Cleaniest hotel and city i’ve visited.",5,Positive

I chose to pay a little more for rooms on upper level, with two beds.  The rooms are a great size for a Std room and the city view was amazing as it over looks the water/ river. At night with the city lights and the boats on the water and the merlion makes for a great view. We were in room 3193 and think it was the best location. We saw all the above from room and from passage window then gardens by the bay. The restaurant, spago, at the pool was amazing. Litchie gin and gormert burger and spring rolls were delicious. Obviously the infinity pool was a must see and was a great thrill. Dec is a rainy month, so there were showers…",5,Positive

Summarizing one of the hotels we aspire to return.",4,Positive
929,"Stayed at this hotel in a bay view club room on the 41st floor. Our whole experience was awesome from start to finish and it was well worth the price paid. Right from our experience at check in to our departure, the hotel exceeded even our highest expectations. The room itself was terrific. We often book suites, but decided not to on this occasion. However, the club room was so big it was virtually a suite anyway. The view of the bay from our room was spectacular. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.",5,Positive

I came into the hotel and the doorman and porter were very friendly and helpful in spite of the busyness of the place. The Lobby was crowded full of tourists, some were checking out and I got confused where to lined up, staff standing there and as I queued up with my luggage I was told to leave my luggage I should have listened to the porter to leave my luggage with him but I didn’t as I wanted to check in first, I think the porters were more organised 😊.

934,I visited Singapore in September 2018 and while I was their a goal of mine was to stay at the marina bay sands. The hotel lives up to all its hype as far as customer service and excellence. Shopping and the restaurant where all top notch but I don’t think I’m going to surprise many people by revealing that the highlight of my stay was the infinity pool. The pictures/ IG PHOTOS don’t tell the entire story. So basically even if it’s for a night I recommend staying here to enjoy all the amenities but the pool is a show stopper!!,5,Positive

938,"Surely a bucket list property given the famous infinity pool overlooking the city.  Aside from that the hotel excels at providing a great experience despite having an insane number of people staying there.  Clean rooms, nice amenities, pool staff constantly tending to the cleaning of the pool, very accommodating check-in staff, proximity to the gardens out back, plenty of dining options, and plenty of feet on the ground to gladly attend to all your needs.  Pricey perhaps, but in this case you get what you pay for.  Despite the crowds, somehow the MBS property is able to deliver on the promise.",5,Positive

940,Treated ourselves to 1 night of our 3 night Singapore break in this iconic hotel. It completely dominates the Singaporean skyline. I have always wanted to stay here and it didn't disappoint. It's superbly located near MRT stations too.  It's very similar to hotel / resorts in Las Vegas. Definitely has the wow factor.    We were in Singapore for 3 days and we spent 1 day around Marina Bay Sands Hotel and in the Gardens area.We obviously spent a few hours in the rooftop infinity pool both in afternoon and 10 pm'sh which is astounding and worth paying to stay for 1 night just to get access to the pool. The unparalleled view and people watching around the pool is a spectacle in itself. Also as a guest you get free entrance in the viewing platform in level below swimming pool. The…,5,Positive
941,Hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Where to begin?!   Check in was swift and professional. I was queuing for about a minute & the receptionist apology for the delay. Good start. She was very nice while being efficient and talked us through our stay.   The room had a beautiful view overlooking the Gardens of the Bay. The room was spotless and flawless in every way.   The infinity pool is of course the big attraction and beware that there is both a kids and adult section if you want a little more quiet time. The pool sells itself but there is more to this fabulous hotel than the pool.

I would highly recommend treating yourself and staying here for your visit to Singapore.

Go on...book it, you wont regret it, I promise!",5,Positive

Make sure you buy your ticket online so you won’t end up queuing twice for the ticket and elevator. The photo they take of you before going up is a bit expensive, but it is of good quality and it comes with a huge frame and free keychains. Try the soft serve ice cream while you’re up it’s worth it.

Interior design is typical of any upscale hotel, quite simple, nothing extraordinary but nice nonetheless. Simple is always best. The room is well-equipped with all the necessities expected of a 5-star hotel and sleep comfort is satisfactory.

We were also provided with some decorations and candy - the gesture was very much appreciated. Not giving 5 starts as in my personal opinion, the hotel lacks personal touch (which is very hard to do in such a large property) and even though the hotel is not old by any stretch of imagination, more techy stuff would have been appreciated as would an outlet for a blow-drier in one…",4,Positive

The staff at Marina Bay Sands were very nice to offer us their spare suitcase.  ( It was a repaired suitcase from their storage ).  Marina Bay has its own mall and best of all the Food Court.  The Food Court is a great place to grab a meal.  The Mall is a nice place to shop Luxury Items.  On of our Amiga’s we travelled with was so happy that she was able to purchase a particular hard to find bag strap at the Louis Vitton Store.  We found the conecting bridge from Marina Bay Sands to Gardens by the Bay very convenient.  Love the awesome views of Singapore from this place.,5,Positive

This is the place to experience once per life and you should experience it as there is no any other place like swimming pool at Marina Bay Sands.

You get a great view of the city in the background. 2). Access to the observation deck for free where you can also get a magnificent view of the city and the gardens by the bay. 3).

The basic services of the hotel are decent enough, nothing much to say about it. Yet after 2 days I realised that the ambience of the area is not much different from a market with the excessive crowds of non-guests wandering around the venue, which diminishes extremely the luxury-comfort of this well-known 5 star hotel. Staying at marina bay sands 1 time is enough for me just for the experience, but I will probably not come back again. Though there is a decent casino if anyone is into that, and the MasterCard theatre for broadway shows touring in Singapore of course.",3,Positive

Unfortunately we were looking for a true 5 star hotel and in reality this is more of a 5 star Las Vegas style resort. Huge shopping mall, celebrity chef style restaurants, casino and various loud, busy bars with “doormen stamping wrists” left us slightly underwhelmed.  Room was pretty good but at £250 lacked a real wow!   If you’re looking for a beautiful hotel with an elegant lobby bar etc this wouldn’t be for you.  Glad to have seen it though.",3,Neutral

Even though, only hotel guests are allowed to a legendary roof top infinity pool, its totaly crowded, in the morning or evening or in rain...always!

If you want kind of a overwhelming resort/casino experience this is the place to be.   Our suite was huge and kept very clean. Staff at whatever breakfast venue we choose were amazing.

If you’re booking this hotel thinking you are going to be getting the best room in Singapore, you’re deluded and I personally think it’s unfair to rate this hotel just on the room. I imagine there are much nicer rooms on offer in singapore but a hotel on this scale is never going to be able to offer the best rooms due to the sheer upkeep on the whole hotel, you book this place for so many more reasons other than a hotel room.

We stayed in a suite which was large well equipped with fantastic views overs the gardens and sea.

The checkin process while not as strenuous as the atlantis was ok, however we were allotted a room in tower 2 while entire group got rooms in tower 1 making the coordination arduous. The rooms are average sized (not expected at this high fare) and very basic ... You feel you are just paying for the view (which is breathtaking for sure. The infinity pool which is a major highlight is also a major hype and is actually a set of 3 small pools. Despite such high stay rates , the hotel is surprisingly low on amenities, it does not have a child play area, the lobby does not even have a proper place to sit .. All in all , at the money that you pay, the hotel is strictly…",3,Neutral
1042,Would recommend staying to experience this hotel. The infinity pool speaks for itself. We had the even better experience of going up for a sunrise photo only to be party of a storm that hit. It was brilliant! Like being in the middle of a hurricane 57 floors up! Service was ok. Check in wasn’t very good. We was early. But happy to wait until 3pm for our room. (Took us a long time in the uk to decide which room type we wanted) they offered us alternative rooms. Which were either lower ground or a different view to check in early. But we wanted to keep the one we had booked. Ended up losing our luggage for a while which was stressful as it was sent to another room. It was all sorted in the end and given our original room type early. So don’t really understand why that wasn’t done…,4,Negative
1043,"It's a great hotel. Great service. Great food, etc. All you could expect from a top line Asian hotel. Room is spacious and nice.   The only real reason to stay here is for the spectacle. The roof pool is a bucket list thing to do and really the only thing that makes this hotel extra special. Everything else is what you would expect.  But to have a meal on the roof, lay in the pool, etc.  That is just special and everyone should do it at least once.  If you like to gamble or shop - then this hotel is for you. Otherwise - it's just all about the roof!",5,Positive
1044,"What a place!!  It’s been on my bucket list for a hot minute. They are the most welcoming staff, let us check in early, upgrades our room for absolutely no reason ;) and give you water and mango juice upon check in. The pool is amazing, get a spot early if the weather is nice. You can walk right out of the hotel to Gardens by the Bay. We will stay here again for sure! ",5,Positive
